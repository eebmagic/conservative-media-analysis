{"P-gRm92ZDno": "hello and welcome so as you can see i'm back from maternity leave i have not yet had the baby but i felt that this issue was too important the issue of roe v wade being overturned and the shrieking that is taking place all across the world i wanted to add my voice to this i want down my voice by telling you guys as you may know i used to be pro-choice for the majority of my life why i am now pro-life these are my five reasons that i am no longer pro-choice the first reason is because most women get abortions under duress or because they are fearful my first introduction to the topic of abortion was when i was about 10 years old and a cousin of mine fell pregnant she wanted to despite how young she was about 15 or 16 years old keep her child but the family said no the family aunts uncles everyone flew in to meet with her and speak to her and tell her how this would ruin her life there were a lot of tears she wanted her child and ultimately she didn't end up keeping it my second introduction to the topic of abortion i must have been about 14 years old maybe just entering high school and it was a similar situation a cousin of mine fell pregnant now she wasn't a teenager and she knew that she wanted to keep her son but a bad boyfriend didn't want her to keep him he put a lot of pressure on her to have an abortion and it actually amounted to him breaking into her home threatening her trying to physically harm her to convince her to get this procedure so far be it from these depictions these media depictions that we have people pretending that women are flowery and skipping into the clinic and it's what they want to do they're feeling empowered they just want to have this repeat procedure they're going to feel great no that's not what's happening you know that i know that i've known six more women since that i've gotten abortion it's always the same scenario moms upsets your parents are upset your friends tell you that your whole life is going to be ruined your boyfriend tells you that you're going to ruin his life women are operating under duress it's a game of peer pressure the celebrities are lying to you they're treating us like the cigarette campaign back in the 60s oh how cool you just get an abortion it's like smoking cigarettes so cool right my body my choice these are forms of propaganda they are lies the truth is that abortions harm people they harm women physically and spiritually the majority of women are being harmed spiritually by the pressure to get an abortion which brings me to reason number two my reason number two as to why i'm no longer pro-choice is because we're not even debating abortion anymore in this country and you know that's true speaking to my husband earlier you guys know he's from the united kingdom and it shocks him to see how far women are going threatening to kill supreme court justices standing outside screaming and screaming like they've been possessed by a demon in fact take a look at this picture this is a picture from outside the supreme court house and you have a woman that is looks to be about seven or eight months pregnant maybe even nine months pregnant and she's written on her body not yet a human she has that written on her belly not yet a human and she's holding a small child it looks to be about one years old what is that if that's not a demonic possession what sort of a woman would do that what we're talking about in america now when you have people that are legislating saying that women should be allowed to get an abortion up to nine months when the child is nine months in the womb i'm nine months pregnant i'm due to give birth in a week and a half right now the idea that i could stroll into a clinic and there are people that believe that i should be able to just have this child removed from me this child that i feel kicking in my belly every second of the day i'm not talking about abortion we're talking about child sacrifice in fact it reminds me of a book that i read about native americans specifically aztecs and the horrific child and human sacrifices that took place they actually committed on one day because they built this temple 26 000 people were sacrificed to raise a temple that they were building 26 000 lives sacrificed on the altar to their belief in gods now we look back at that and we think that sounds so barbaric that could never happen in society today it's 2022. but in america yeah there's approximately 898 000 abortions per a year i know it's not for a temple we're not building some big temple and sacrificing these children to gods no we're doing it for ready convenience for i'm not ready to be a mom i don't want to be a father so get an abortion for this is going to end my career this baby would get in the way of my career that seems worse than what they're doing america is is is unlike any other country in the world in this regard in fact the only country that we are similar to when it comes uh to our strategy of abortion is north korea this is this is like no other country in the world where you could find women that were willing to stand out outside of a supreme court nine months pregnant and say no this is not a human you can you can take this out of me if you want to again we're talking about a demonic possession we're not talking about abortion anymore all right guys it's time to take a break and talk about something i use on my computer and personal devices every single day and that is express vpn every time you connect to an unencrypted network think in cafes hotels airports your online data is not secured any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data but expressvpn creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so they can't it would basically take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past expressvpn's encryption especially fan works on all of your devices phone laptop tablet even on your smart tv and it's so easy to use just fire up the app and click one button and then you're protected this has been a game changer for me personally because i can finally have some peace of mind that my information is not being stolen by big tech you can get an extra three months of expressvpn free at expressvpn.com candace that's expressvpn.com candace expressvpn.com candace my reason number three as to why i'm no longer pro-choice is because we were never debating abortion in the first place we were always debating eugenics the fact that they have tried to bury the history of abortion and have tried to bury the history of planned parenthood makes me sick who was margaret sanger the founder of planned parenthood she was a woman who wrote this exact quote ready she wrote about quote the gradual suppression elimination and eventual extinction of defective stocks those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of american civilization she was the woman behind the negro project the negro project which was taken on by what is today known as planned parenthood she was an avowed racist and a eugenicist she believed that the negro race needed to be exterminated she was fearful like many progresses of her time that if people of a lower stock began breeding then the whiter supreme nordic race would be dysfunctional become dysfunctional over time she spoke in front of the ku klux klan all you have to do is look up history you really just have to look it straight in the face to see what abortion has always been about it has been about eugenicism and of course we look at the rates of abortion and who's having the most of them black americans black women are at the forefront have the highest rates of abortion in the united states and yet they try to bury that my reason number four is because roe v wade was always unconstitutional maybe if our american education system could take a break from teaching foolishness like crt and lgbtqia rights and confusing children they might actually pause to teach basic civics you have a lot of people that are running around operating under some false assumption that the supreme court took away their constitutional right to an abortion no you never had a constitutional right to an abortion the supreme court does not have within its power the right to make laws instead their job is to interpret the constitution to take a look at state laws that are being made and to say whether or not these states are in line with the constitution do you want a constitutional amendment that includes your abortion well that would be the first time that women actually got to vote on the issue considering it was seven men that voted on roe v wade at least there was one woman that voted against roe v wade which was signed on by seven men women never got the right to vote if you would like a constitutional amendment for abortion then you're going to have to understand that there are only two ways that constitutional amendments are made the first is two-thirds of both houses can propose a constitutional amendment the second is that you can call for a convention of the states so two-thirds of state legislatures can call for a convention they can propose an amendment and they can have an amendment ratified by three-fourths of the states those are the only ways that constitutional amendments can come about my reason number five is very simple and i say this as someone who is obviously very pregnant but reason number five that i am adamantly now pro-life and why i am no longer pro-choice is because i am a woman because i am now a mother that's the bigger reason because i'm now a mother because i feel that throughout my entire life the government spent so much time in initiatives via the public school system trying to erase me from my divine nature my maternal instincts from my femininity but all of that arrived suddenly the moment that i became a mother and i believe that our role as mothers and as women in this society is to fight for children and to protect children at all costs we should never be the people screaming outside of a supreme court house demanding the right to have 890 000 of them murdered per year so that's what i'm going to do i'm going to continue to stand up for children i'm going to continue to stand up for families and to stand up for women who are being destroyed by this abortion industry thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get

have been following the Scandal I haven't actually spoken out on it because it's just so ridiculous Candace Cameron Beret she works over now at a network called Great American family and she was giving an interview in the Wall Street Journal and she talked about how happy she was that she worked for a network that would be putting traditional marriages on display great amazing it's it's so unique nowadays to see traditional marriage and values on display to see Christian values on display at all that she should be proud to work with a network that is okay with that right now every network is going the other direction they're like you got to have something lesbian gay trans whatever but she's proud to work there and this caused an absolute Firestorm that people are saying I can't believe she said this Chief among them by the way is a girl probably saying her last name wrong JoJo siwa she used to be on that dance competition show I actually washed her on that dance competition show she was super likable she then went on to have a very lucrative YouTube career because she appeals to children and she's sparkly and and great all these things are happy for her but she's come out now as a lesbian a few years ago and she has a girlfriend and so now she thinks that what we want to hear from her rather than her just making kids have fun is how much of a lesbian she is and she has attacked Candace Cameron Burr this is the second time she's attacked her the first time she attacked her here is because Candace Cameron Burr didn't Beret did not see her at an event and she took it as a personal attack personally I think JoJo siwa has feelings for Candace Cameron Beret she's got some fascination with her Candace Cameron Beret apologized for not seeing her at an event and reached out to her and was very kind and accepting but now JoJo siwa is again mad at her Candace Cameron Beret because Candace Cameron Beret likes traditional marriages yeah she's like traditional marriages like you like untraditional marriages you are constantly promoting your fact that you're a lesbian why can't Cameron Candace Bure promote the fact that she is a Christian conservative oh I know why JoJo because you're a bigot you think you're accepting but you're actually a bigot right you guys have got every letter Under the Sun lgbtqrstuv well how about an H in there for heterosexual how about a c in there for Christian and conservative can you guys fit a little more room in your alphabet soup to be accepting toward people who do not live that way who do not have homosexual marriages is nobody yells at you for doing your YouTube channel and talking about your lesbian relationship with your girlfriend every five seconds maybe you could leave her alone for the work that she does and saying that I would also like to put the way that I live on display it is miraculous to me that people like Jojo siwa cannot see their own hypocrisy that they think that the only way that people have to live is exactly like them which far from making them accepting JoJo it makes you a bigot so leave Candace Cameron Beret alone She's Just Not That Into You all right guys

point because it's very important um it is a lie to suggest that I'm not blaming you for this Lie by the way to suggest that it's just reversible it's a very dangerous lie right there are extreme consequences of going on puberty blockers it's not like you're just pausing a YouTube video you can come back and say okay now I want to watch the rest of the video once you have skipped puberty you have skipped puberty the consequence can be if you're a boy and you skipped puberty you would have literally a micro penis you can become infertile uh you cannot experience sexual pleasure these are lifelong decisions that are being made by adults who I think are well-meaning I don't think you know Marin Morris wants to harm children but it is very dangerous when she is using an opinion that people are taking in as facts when they actually believe that their children are going to be rendered happier because of all of this no child can decide for themselves whether or not they want to have children long term and say you know I'm willing to forego this they don't know that that's not the information that they're being given when they go to the doctor's office I also think it's dangerous to assign meaning to what children say children have a different idea every single day are you actually gender dysphoric or are you just a child you know do you want to be Spider-Man today would you support a scenario and I always think of this scenario because I babysat where I had a little girl who legitimately came to me crying and said she was a mermaid like she did not want to go out of the bath would you view it as responsible if I said yes you are a mermaid and you can sleep in the bath from now on and now I'm going to take you to get procedures to have scales sewn onto your body would that sound absolutely insane to you for me as an adult to do that I will share what I think and my understanding of being a conservative is you don't want other people telling you how to parent and that's what I'll say I mean if that would be a defense for child abuse though right I don't want people telling me how to parent but I don't want children abused ever I don't want children abused either but your perception of abuse might be different than my perception of abuse that's very dangerous that's a very so why should your perception have to do with her kids and her perception have to do with your kids why don't you parent your kids and you parents exactly absolutely exactly so I what I think that that walking away from that is very dangerous and I will tell you why we're talking about abuse right so I would not be comfortable this argument if we were in the court of law and somebody said hey you've just been beating your children for eight months and locked him in a basement and someone said let me parent my kids you know hey you're a man you've been raping your child you know for the last 10 years let me parent my kids there are truths and there are untruths and to me it is a truth that having your child undergo transition is is a form of child abuse I miss that that's your opinion but also I feel like you know this is why we're here today in the world out there the amount of gender dysphoric young people that are going through any medical intervention it's not that many that's not true once you have numbers that's not true that is true it's I don't have numbers I'm not going to share but um I do would you like to hear them uh it doesn't matter to me no but it should because you're saying something right so like we want to get to this and then sure share it and cite it so there was a study that was done in the UK within a six year period of time there was a four thousand percent increase there was another study that came out in Texas just a couple of months ago that mirrored the same four thousand percent so we have a four thousand percent increase within um children that are medically transitioned if you take that four thousand percent increase and you take what is made over a lifetime with synthetic hormones with these children it's 1.3 million dollars if you start a child at 14 and that child lives to 80 years old that's 1.3 million dollars we're not talking about what I'm getting at is the amount of the amount of children or teenagers doing this I don't think it's hundreds of thousands it might not even be more than ten thousand a year to be honest I don't know I'm not going to share a number that I don't know but if I had to guess in the United States the amount of teenagers or pre-teens that are that are having any kind of hormone um intervention in the thousands I'm guessing okay and how many hundreds of millions of people and and uh how many teenagers are there in America countless Millions so what you're saying is that it is let the parents there's not their children so you you are fine now that you've been given the facts of how this by the way these are the effects that have happened to somebody who did this as an adult right yes and I and we are look at Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner would share a very different experience she's transitioned now forever has spoken out about the depression that Caitlyn faced post-transitioning and things of that nature but I do want to say this you are now armed with more facts we are telling you that this can render someone infertile this can render somebody with well like I said at the very beginning it wouldn't be my first go-to but what would you do it's okay it's not about first go-to okay if you're you're a mother of two in 15 years 12 years if your child says continues not once obviously if your child over a period of months says I'm going to kill myself I just told you that I don't do it that's not true well let me ask the question that's true let's cite the study on that because that is not true I'm just asking the question a whole generation of children because you just said that and you are fundamentally wrong no I'm it's not okay it is not my question was directed that is not an opinion no it's a retraction on seven studies okay you cannot say that and have it true the odds of those kids committing suicide will happen to seven to ten years after you want to talk about facts and feelings we'll do it but don't say these kids are going to kill themselves odds are is they will okay so after that they're presenting I said if a child tells you over the period of months and you have them seen for suicidal ideation right I would not put them on something that's I know is going to long term give them real Suicidal Thoughts uh because they realize they can't go back and their parents have assigned you know truth to what was just a feeling right um it is my opinion that there there is no such thing as transitioning yes you can uh medically castrate yourself yes you can get a bunch of cosmetic procedures you know at the end of the day you can't just transition to be a man or to be a woman you know I am a woman I can you know there are things that women can do that men cannot and because I have looked into this issue and I've spoken to people that are being silenced there are so many people like Scott that are coming out and saying listen to my story early onset osteoporosis people's bones I mean could you imagine your bones deteriorating yeah for a child for boys if you go on these hormone blockers right not being able to have children that's a bit it also goes back to what I said a minute ago I don't know the number but I'm guessing it's not that many young what do you mean when you say like what do you expect I guess the reaction to be if you go well it's just not that many people does that somehow justify Marin Morris signaling that this is just an LG because it's not to me the T issue should be knocked off LGB you're talking about a sexual preference when you're talking about transitioning you're talking about medical procedures you're talking about castrating children some people some trans people don't don't have medical intervention but we're here discussing children because I disagreed about the children yes [Music] thank you", "5KcoMUbNxgQ": "Casey Anthony I'm sure that name is ringing a bell of course how could anybody forget the infamous Casey Anthony case now I'm not allowed to say that she's a murderer because she was infamously acquitted of murdering her two-year-old daughter in 2011 but what I can say I think legally is that I believe nothing that comes out of this woman's mouth at all have not believed her from the very beginning and I still don't believe her today despite this she is making a reappearance in the news because she has taken place in a three-part docu-series on peacock which will be her first sit-down interview and she is going to blame her father George for the 2008 murder of her daughter Kaylee and she suggests that he may have killed her to cover up sexually abusing her and she also is going to make the claim again that she has no idea what happened in the interview she claims that both she and her daughter were sexually abused by her father and she claimed that in the past she was abused by her father and her brother claims in which they have both vehemently denied neither of them has ever been charged in connection with the allegations nor have either of them been implicated in Kaylee's death doesn't matter not going to stop her from coming back now I just want to remind you about a couple of facts pertaining uh to this case it took Casey Anthony 31 days to call the police and to tell them that Kaylee was missing so there is my earlier analysis of me not believing a word that comes out of her mouth I'm a mother I'm a mother to an almost two-year-old the idea that it would take me 31 days to not to think to call the police or to to alert the authorities to the fact that he was missing just not imaginable you're just not going to convince me that that was an actual plausibility and that things somehow were tricky and that you didn't say everything you had to say throughout your entire child beyond that I will remind you that it was Casey's mother not Casey herself that first alerted the authorities to Kaylee's appearance her mother's name is Cindy it was her her and her husband George had not seen Casey or Kaylee for a month and then they found Casey's car in a tow yard and George said that the smell of the car took his breath away in his 9-1-1 call Cindy told the dispatcher Kaylee's missing it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car okay so that is just giving you a little reminder of what went on during that case and for whatever reason she never thought to contact the authorities we found out then throughout the trial that she liked to party a lot obviously she was a very young mom and I don't know what the purpose is of this I don't peacock obviously the purpose is money but also to what try to appeal to our senses and make us think that we should be there's more to the story that wasn't presented in court and that perhaps maybe she had nothing to do with this and she just mystery seriously just didn't think to call the authorities when her daughter was missing for 31 days I'm not going for it but I'm just reporting to let you guys know that um yeah that is a topic of the day today you are going to be seeing and hearing more from Casey Anthony in case you were missing her for any reason all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about the Arizona Governor's race I don't want to it breaks

matter released their 990 IRS filing they collected 80 million dollars where is that money it's not here everything looks worse than it was where have you seen that money impacted throughout the city so my producer just sent me a link it is just shocking to me because of how much money was raised to think that where he lived the bills weren't being covered super frustrating but that's a dead end so and here's where it gets really interesting ready for some BLM Pride another 200k went to escorts BDSM workers strippers Peep Show workers phone sex operators and webcam performers and then at that moment it became personal and I thought not only am I going to say the truth I am going to scream the truth louder than you can scrambleize foreign [Music]", "MELK1S7oPBU": "I think I have endured the most abuse I've ever endured in my entire life in the past week I I just I don't know everyone just attacking me from every angle there's just fake articles being planted every left right and Center I just I've never been under more media attacks than I have in the last week and of course it's because I dropped the BLM Doc and how dare you step on our toes Candace how dare you we've already agreed in the narrative George Floyd was a victim BLM is heroic for extracting tens of millions of dollars from people that felt guilty about the narrative that we made up out of thin air about policing in America was made it up and everyone bought it we made the celebrities put up black squares how dare Candace Owens come and clarify that we're all a bunch of liars and pigs actually that's what the media mainstream media is it's a bunch of liars and pigs who are propagandists and who work at the behest of the government right they collude that's what they do and so I have been under attack and rather than draw attention to some of the more Sinister attacks I actually wanted to draw attention to something that was a little more light-hearted um I like Jason Whitlock uh he is another conservative commentator we invited him to the premiere and he watched it and somebody sent me this clip of him talking about what he both liked and didn't like about my documentary so take a listen there were some moments that that I thought were great that Shamika I'll bring you back in on this one when she went to Patrice culler's house and but they had already kind of shown this on social media but it was the way they unpacked it in the documentary I found it humorous I found it compelling I found it powerful but it was undercut by one thing again because she's basically making fun of Patrice Collins million dollar home or two million dollar home there's no black life I can't see any black life anywhere it was hilarious but I'm just telling you I'm watching it and other people are watching it and they're gonna be like well hold on Candace is there with two white dudes she she ain't brought no other than herself she ain't brought no black life to this neighborhood or to this movie and and it it again this is where I'm saying I think she needs some help the whole fact that she went to Patrice culler's house in a car in a car service she's in the back seat she's got on diamond earrings she's dressed like she's going to go play bridge in that neighborhood with a bunch of white conservative women again I don't I'm not denigrating anybody but I'm just saying in turn if you want to really convey the message and hit it home there's this little small little subtle tweaks that you make that make your point more powerful and compelling which leaves me to my next question like is Candace was she the right messenger for this message [Music] okay again Jason I'm gonna send you some love here but I do have to comment back on this essentially your point is that I'm not ghetto enough to engage in this documentary this is a critique I get all the time like canvas speaks proper English and so people are not going to be able to connect with her as a what did you want me to what this is how I dress this is actually I don't have a stylist this is legitimately how I dress so you want me to pretend to be someone I'm not what throw on some uh Fresh Air Force Ones some old school FUBU put big Hoops that have my name in the middle and say yo yo yell at the gate it's not who I am right I made a documentary to expose the truth I'm not going to present a lie while trying to expose others for lying that doesn't make sense I'm not going to present a lie while presenting the truth I I I find a lot of difficulty with this entire concept that when black Americans look presentable they somehow can't connect that's the actually one of the problems I think in Black Culture and as a final two points to this you're talking about the fact that I showed up with my camera crew well yes they did happen to be white uh car service no we rented a car that could fit the camera crew obviously we were filming a documentary um but I don't live my life in the way that Patrice does I was pointing to the irony that this is a woman that is sitting supplanted in Beverly Hills or in what was it a Laurel Canyon in California and she says that she's terrified of white people it's only about white people that are around her I don't say I'm terrified of white people so what I do is I engage in a meritocracy the people that were the best people that needed behind the lens were behind the lens people that I felt were the best security members were the people that were the security members that were on site I hire people based on their Merit not based on their skin color I don't want us to engage in the same kind of racism that has become commonplace on the left lastly I don't know why people keep falling for this but these my friend are the diamond earrings that you're talking about Jason they're fake do you want these send me a note I will literally send them to you I remember Hawk news from black lives matter basically made the same arguments you made when he was on my show and he said look at you with your big diamond earrings and I offered that I said hawk if you want these earrings you can have them right now I think these cost like 50 bucks and they were from Nordstrom so if you want them Jason you can have them all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about the most

country music legend john rich thank you happy to do that you were actually you were actually my first guest yeah thanks for having me back i was wondering i wonder if i ever get invited back and here i am yeah well you made it so easy for me because i was so nervous there was so much to learn with doing a live audience and then i was like and then you were such a fun guest and i was like you knocked it out of the park well your show makes everybody wonder what did we do before this show everybody watches your show every day right [Music] so much you always have so much going on in your life and i there are a few things i really want to hit on today i'm going to try to not make this interview three hours um but you told me a story i was at your house and i was shooting your new show which i'll get into later um and you told me a story which was so inspiring to me i notoriously did a rant recently about how mothers and fathers need to step up in the school system and and stomp on this anti-american education all the you know the sexualization of children and then you told me a story actually before i did that rant about what you did your son attends a christian school i'm just going to give you the floor here to tell the story because it's kind of amazing yeah so they go to a school that you would never think those things would ever be there and that's why they go there and all of a sudden you realize people have been asleep at the wheel long enough that even a lot of the christian schools have been infiltrated by people who do not line up with the with the ideals that go into what a bible-based education looks like so everything from critical race theory to like you said sexualization of kids and the way that they're putting books out and some of the things they're talking about subjects that they're bringing up i said what about chapel do you guys still have chapel i mean i thought that was well in chapels where they're bringing some of this stuff up i went hang on a minute and so this was before we knew what critical race theory was there was no name for what it was there was we just didn't know it was just an academia and regular parents didn't know what this phrase meant all i knew was that you can't tell one kid that he's not gonna make it because what he looks like and then tell his buddy he's not going to make it because of what you look like that's what you're telling these kids i'm like these kids play on the same baseball team together we go on spring break with their parents they come over and we cook hot dogs up by a swimming pool

people they say well jesus was meek and mild and whatever yeah but he had a backbone i mean he was strong enough to die for us right i mean that's that's toughest man ever lives jesus christ but he said uh uh you'd be better that a millstone be tied around your neck and thrown into the depths of the sea than to ever cause one of these little ones to stumble that's the word he uses to stumble tell them something teach them something do something to them that causes them and their in their innocence to stumble forward meaning basically jesus said you'd be better off to go kill yourself than do that tie rock around your neck jump in the ocean and so i brought that up uh to the school and i said you realize that's what it says right now let me read this to you does that sound you're causing kids to stumble well i can tell you a lot of people got upset but a lot of more people got up out of their chairs and went bingo we cannot allow this to exist at this school so all the people that were pushing that nonsense are now gone they all got fired they're all out of there and the parents are now watching i mean one of one of the best uh one of the best by-products of of schooling uh virtually which sucks for the kids but one good thing is we all got to see what they're learning and hear how the teachers are talking and going wait a second what is you're just here hearing it out of your you know wait a second what did she say you get to dive into their books and i think parents all around the country have been turned on to what's been going on a long time and you're correct to say that everyone has been asleep at the wheel it's astonishing even for me and i wasn't in school that long ago but to see what they're teaching now i'm like this is a whole this is a whole different america you're going to raise people that you know hate american values hate american principles hate free markets take capitalism and believe that everything is an issue because of race but you did not make it out of there without being burned literally well they they literally burned pictures of me out in a parking lot a guy calls he said well i've seen like the 50th guy nails burned a picture of your face i said did they start with the mustache i really hope they started with the musk that you know but that's what they do when you call them out and they know you've just pinged them with something they can't get out of is they just go crazy and they do stuff but parents have got to be they've got to be patient methodical and cannot back up if you're not willing to fight for yourself fight for your kids who do you think your kids are watching watching mom and dad so with all this nonsense candace going on in the country right now these kids are also seeing it they're picking up on it even at 9 10 11 years old they're figuring out something ain't right going on well is danny and mama just yelling at the tv or are they also going down and signing up to work at the school or be on the school board or run for commission or a mayor they doing other things that they can get in there and really fight effectively and i think that's what parents have to do

in case you guys don't know who Hayden Panettiere is she's an actress and I'm going to remind you why you do know her honestly I think her best work Remember the Titans such a good movie back when we used to have productive conversations about race and it felt like America was all together and recognizing the harm to the past and wanting to move forward into an actually Progressive future yeah Hayden Panettiere played the um child remember the blonde girl who was so likable and helped her dad coach and Remember the Titans that is who she played and now she's done a lot more she's on a TV show that's called Nashville but I want to talk about this uh cultural moment where she appeared on red table talk red table talk is a talk show that is run by Jada Pinkett Smith Will Smith's toxic wife and the reason why I want to discuss it is because I often bring up this I idea that I feel is penetrating American society that makes manhood obsolete no matter what the man is wrong no matter what the man can do no good in a relationship and I had followed Hayden Panettiere on her spiral she had a public spiral and the reason why I followed her is because it was interesting at the time when I was pregnant to consider that perhaps this woman began this spiral because she suffered a very traumatizing birth so Hayden Panettiere she's a very small person and she came out in interviews after she gave birth and basically said that her child tore her apart on the way out and it caused postpartum depression which it's very real for women I want to say this very clearly I felt so sad for Hayden Panettiere it was obvious that she was struggling she was putting herself into rehab more than one time she went to rehab to deal with postpartum depression she felt like her body wasn't her own I mean those even those moments of sadness whether or not we're being extreme and always referring to that depression it is so natural you're it's such a period of adjustment for women you just give birth you either have your first child and your entire life kind of uh has to change and it shifts your body is not your own by the way if you're breastfeeding it's not your own if you're not breastfeeding you feel guilty about the fact that you're not breastfeeding I mean there are a lot of what I believe to be natural understandable emotions that women go through after they give birth despite the fact that being able to have children have family It's a Wonderful miracle and it's something that we should never take for granted so I was particularly interested in this Hayden Panettiere story because so many things seemed to go wrong for her after this she checked herself into rehab as I mentioned prior a few times and she began struggling by her she's admitting this by the way began struggling with substance abuse issues now at the time she was married actually I think that they were just engaged her ex-partner was Vladimir klishko you may recognize that name because he is Ukrainian and he is involved in Ukrainian politics and he's a boxer a world-renowned boxer so at the time she was with him and because she was struggling with these various substance abuse issues and because she was in out of rehab she eventually signed over full custody of Kaya that's her little girl to him and that was in 2018 but now in this red table talk interview she is claiming that it wasn't really a mutual agreement to do so and she felt that Kaya was just going to go over and visit him in Ukraine like she always did but once the little girl got to Ukraine klischko told her that he wanted full custody so she's painting the picture like she wasn't in a good place she goes off to rehab and Klitschko kind of convinces her to sign some papers and ends up with full custody take a listen of what to what she actually said on red table talk I also remember her dad calling me and he said Kai is going around and asking other women if she can call them Mommy and my like breath hitched and and my heart stopped and he was laughing he thought this was funny and it was horrifying to me he didn't get it as opposed to me who saw you know that's a trauma reaction I mean as much as I have tried to explain how much she needs her mom and how it's going to rear its ugly head later when she is older and it could turn into anger depression sadness whatever it is but it's going to be a trauma I thought this was an agreement that you came to that you felt it was best that your daughter be with her dad at first it was not because it wasn't a discussion it wasn't if he had come to me and said um you know I think because of where you're at right now and the struggles that you're having it would be good for her to you know be over here with me for a while to which I probably if I had enough of a conversation would have said okay that that makes sense I get it I'll come there if you know to visit and and and stuff like that because of the way that it was done it was very upsetting I mean it was the worst signing those papers was like the most heartbreaking thing I've ever had to do in my life so you get it's a bunch of women sitting around feeling very bad for her because she's lost custody of her daughter Kaia but she also signed the papers so it's not exactly like she didn't know that she was going to lose her daughter but she paints it as if she didn't as she just thought she was going to go to Ukraine like she always does but now realizes that no I actually signed over uh full custody and this is really wrong this is a really bad cultural moment because first and foremost they should have pushed back on her the story makes no sense she's saying that Kaya already used to frequent Ukraine which means that young Kaya has a passport I know this obviously because my children have a passport and they frequent England to see the rest of to see their father's side of the family right you need both parents present to get a passport you don't need post parent both parents present to then travel thereafter meaning that if my husband wants to get on a plane right now with my son and go to the UK he can do that so why did Vladimir qleach go after her daughter already had a passport and had visited Ukraine multiple times why did he suddenly bring her papers clearly she must have known that these papers weren't just to Grant her what she already had access to Ukraine clearly they were going through a situation in which she was struggling by her own account of substance abuse issues she was in rehab and he did something that is in my opinion heroic okay he took care of the little girl he understood that his the mother was not in a good mental space right at the time she was choosing to abuse substances over choosing to raise her child again that is not to make it seem as though I am not sympathetic to what she went through I do honestly believe her and her account of what happened but she was going through a tough time here is what she was going through ready in October of 2015 she checked into a treatment facility battling postpartum depression following the birth of her her first child in May 2016 she returned to treatment recently in case you're thinking well that's years ago and you can understand that now she may want to be more a part of her daughter's life recently in May of this year she was involved in a fist fight outside of a restaurant with her boyfriend I don't know if this is still her boyfriend his name is Brian Hickerson he had been arrested for domestic abuse against her recently he was on probation and if you go and you pursue the clip you will find her and her husband getting into an altercation outside of a restaurant in California this year right the cameras are running and allegedly it's being alleged that her boyfriend spit on a patron inside and this led to a brawl outside and as she's jumping in the brawl and trying to pull her boyfriend out of the circumstance she's saying to him over and over again jail Brian jail Brian jail because she's reminding him that he he is on probation for domestic violence and that if he gets arrested again for this brawl he's going to get a straight ticket back to prison right so it is to me a PR move for these women to sit around in a circle and to pretend like this was a story from a long time ago in which Vladimir Klitschko took advantage of her it's not this is a woman who is struggling for real reasons right but who is still struggling to create a safe environment for her child now I understand how Hollywood Works she probably calls her PR agent she is probably trying to repair her Public Image and all of that is aspirational and all of those things are good but what is more aspirational and what is even more good is the fact that there is a man who despite how difficult it is early on for men to be a part of you know the infant stage when really the infant just needs its mother it just needs milk you will when you get married if you are married and listening to this you understand this if you have children men don't really know what to do in those early days they're confused despite all of this Vladimir klichko stepped to the plate and he saved his daughter from an erratic household yes he took her to Ukraine but it is a great Injustice not to acknowledge this heroic feat yes it is true what she is saying children need their mothers but they also need mothers that are stable and they also need their fathers fathers that are willing to step to the plate as Vladimir klischko did if their children need help alright guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on adoption as well as the gentle parenting craze so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "iIKqDS1k4Ww": "so there has been some development in the Balenciaga by Adidas shoot which had a lot of child pornography hidden in it the development is that Kim Kardashian has finally responded after six days and before we get into her response I want to recap what went down in case you guys have missed this entire Scandal and haven't been paying attention so Balenciaga you guys know the brand they are huge fashion house Kim Kardashian is usually dripped in it from head to toe she's one of the big celebrity faces behind their campaigns dropped a recent campaign in which they had children that were holding stuffed animals children that looked like they had been abducted were holding stuffed animals that had BDSM clothing on it that had their eyes scratched out the stuffed animals not the children and a bunch of very suggestive things around the children like alcohol as one example behind one child people were understandably going what the heck is this and in case they weren't sure what the heck it was they also had an image image of a Balenciaga by Adidas bag which was on top of a bunch of papers one of the papers was a document regarding a court decision a Supreme Court decision Ashcroft versus the freedom of speech Coalition so what was this case pertaining to essentially the freedom of speech Coalition one and they had some elements pertaining to Virtual child pornography were moved from a larger child pornography act basically saying that those particular elements were too broad so essentially by having these documents beneath the Balenciaga bag essentially blunt Saga was saying yay ha ha now we can sort of experiment with virtual child pornography and there's nothing that you can do about it because yeah there's nothing protecting these children we got those pieces the freedom of speech Coalition got those pieces removed hahaha not very funny at all it's absolutely despicable these images are despicable the people behind these images are obviously in my opinion pedophiles and child groomers and of course we should be seeing a celebrity campaign to get everybody involved canceled to have their life through and that's what they love to do they love to get people's lives ruined for things that don't matter she would think that when it really matters and we're talking about children and we're talking about child pornography every single celebrity who's posted a black Square I'm posting a black Square to show that I'm not a racist right every single one of these celebrities who got down to the streets to March for George Floyd you would expect that they would also be using their platforms to say I am no longer working with Balenciaga but crickets there have been absolute crickets and yet obviously people people like you and me are upset and we have been keeping the heat on these individuals and expecting them to give us a response well a lot of heat was given to Gabriel gallim Bertie he was the person that was shooting the photo people said what the heck is this or are you a pedophile is something wrong with you well finally Gabe Gabriel Gallen Bertie responded I actually believe his response this is what he wrote on his Instagram account and there are a few typos it looks to me that English might not be his first language here's what he said he said following the hundreds of hate mail and messages that I received as a result of the photos that I took for the Balenciaga campaign I feel compelled to make this statement I am not in a position to comment about balenciaga's choices but I must stress that I was not entitled in any manner whatsoever to either choose the products nor the models nor the combination of the same as photographer I was only and solely requested to light the given scene and take the shots according to my signature style as usual for a commercial shoot the direction of the campaign and the choice of the objects displayed are not in the hands of the photographer I suspect that any person prone to pedophilia searches on the web and has unfortunately too much of an easy access to images completely different than mine absolutely explicit in their awful content accusations like these are addressed against the wrong targets and distract from the real problem and the criminals also I have no connection with the photo where a supreme court document appears that one was taken in another set by other people and that was falsely associated with my photos now I'm going to tell you that I actually believe this photographer I believe that he was told to Simply take the shot because I went through his Instagram page and he does he go goes all around the world and he has done this for years and he finds children and these children look very innocent they're not dressed in weird clothing or anything and he asks them to just like share the the toys they play with so he does these this Toy Story series where children from all over the world show what they play with and it's something that he finds to be artistic and beautiful and I was not offended by those photos whatsoever so I think if they selected him because of his Toy Story series and they brought him into a much darker scene where this really had nothing to do with toys the children did not look friendly and and it just was very very dark so I actually believe that statement and he's kind of saying they're blaming me for this shoot but there were other people involved who staged this entire thing and I had nothing to do with those documents retaining a child pornography so I do think that he Bears some responsibility because if I had walked onto that set and seen those items I would have walked away but I do believe that people are venting their frustration on him when there are other people that are involved namely by the way uh there is a stylist at Balenciaga who has worked there since 10 2014 her name is Lata volkova and I am telling you that she is clearly very involved in trying to experiment with children and push the edge and and make things pornographic and satanic because all you have to do is look at her Instagram page to see how real that is okay these are actual photos from lada's Instagram I'm going to take you through them in case you're listening to the podcast and you can't see them but you should go onto YouTube and find this episode so that you can see them because they're they're so disturbing here's one image in this image there is a child that looks to be about nine years old that is taped down with duct tape in a chair she has her ankles restrained by duct tape and she has on almost goggles over her face like I would describe them as black black goggles you can't see what she's seeing and she's linked up their VR glasses and she's linked up to these VR glasses to a computer and the child's hands are behind her back behind the chair and it obviously just looks like an abducted child it is it is so disturbing and terrifying the idea that this is allowed on Instagram When Donald Trump is not makes me sick the idea that she can pretend that because she's an artist it's okay to have a photo of a child that looks like she's simply handcuffed you can't see her eyes she's bound to a chair by duct tape this is under a category of art absolutely disgusting in case that's not enough here's another photo which she has a child where she has taken a photo of a child it looks like an artistic rendering of a child that is split in half at the waist dead in what looks to be a field and has their guts spilling out in the field again the child looks to be about nine years old maybe nine ten or eleven years old in that age Reign and they're just dead in the fields with their guts hanging out but it's okay guys it's art so I guess we're not supposed to mind this is okay with Instagram this display is completely fine because this is artistic expression or something like that which is probably what the Ashcroft versus freedom of speech Coalition allowed for right it's too broad this could be an artistic rendering it's not it's sick it's disturbing here is another photo that is featured it is a child okay that is holding a Dead skull of a human being and raising it towards the sun it feels like a Satanic ritual there are weird symbols all around it which I should explore later and see what all these symbols mean also the letter I mean I'm the number 69 inscribed on the side it's just a child holding a Dead skull pointed Towards the Sky what does that mean I don't know it feels safe Titanic here's another image that she has Lada on her Instagram there's an image of her clearly wearing all red her hair isn't red and her hands have what is likely red paint but is supposed to look like blood all over them and then she is holding two baby dolls that are also dripped in red which are supposed to look like blood so essentially she is holding what it's supposed to believe you are supposed to think from this artistic style are two dead babies obviously why else would you be holding two baby dolls that are in blood with the blood smeared all over your hand again this is satanic it feels ritualistic there is something disturbing about this image but it is allowed on Instagram because I don't know I guess it's art and she herself looks satanic if that is her in fact in the picture another image that she has is of a devil uh sitting above a pentagram with a person who you can't really see what the age is that is sitting inside of the pen inside of the pentagram this goes on on all over a lot of volkova's Instagram it's very obvious that this person is dark and is twisted and is definitely experimenting with Satanism that's what this is Satanism she has a fixation with children and death and pushing the edge why would Balenciaga hire this individual and keep this individual as a lead stylist it makes entirely no sense but you know I was very much looking forward to Kim Kardashian coming out and condemning this because Kim Kardashian loves giving statements about how grave a person she is she's a black Square kind of an individual she made statements against her own husband throughout the anti-Semitism Scandal saying that she stands with her friend in the Jewish Community I was looking forward to her saying that she stands with the children that have been sexually trafficked over borders to children that are victims of sex crimes the children that have been victimized by pedophiles and I waited because I knew that she would do the right thing then what happened was Thanksgiving passed and I went on Instagram and she still hadn't made a statement I thought that's very weird this is an easy layup Kim Kardashian a very easy layup that I'm giving to you condemn child pornography okay Balenciaga didn't come out and deny what happened they said they were sorry oh we're sorry these this we should have never published this okay they've admitted that this has happened it's very easy to come out as a person that is always dripped in their clothing as a person that sits beside them at fashion shows as a person that has a financial deal with Balenciaga as one of the faces of Balenciaga to say that you had no idea this is going to be brought to the Forefront that you strongly condemn it and then to make the obvious choice which is to say that you will no longer work with them because everybody has to have a red line and that red line should always be child pedophilia child pornography anything that harms children especially when you are a number or are a mother okay so Kim did Issue a statement after I said wow I can't believe we have made it all the way to Sunday it has been six days and she still has not made a statement of course this went viral and then within an hour she did Issue a statement here's what she wrote quote I have been quiet for the past few days not because I haven't been disgusted and outraged by the recent Balenciaga campaigns but because I wanted an opportunity to speak to their team to understand for myself how this could have happened let's pause right there okay that is stupid that is stupid Kim you want us to believe that you took six days because you were just trying to understand what happened something that we all understood within minutes of seeing the photo and discussing it and disseminating it widely we understood what happened children were taken advantage of in a shoot by pedophiles and sickos and Weirdos okay children were being used as props for somebody that has a bizarre sexual fetish for children but no you needed six days to understand what happened as if you had to send an email to an info box at Balenciaga as if you're not Kim Kardashian who can pick up the phone call the CEO call the career director call The Stylist directly and say what the hell is this and get an immediate answer but no you think we're all so stupid that we're going to believe that it just took you it took you some time to understand what happened you needed time to process no what you actually did Kim was you probably talked to your mom and said oh my God your mom said it's okay Kim it's Thanksgiving give it a couple of days and everyone's gonna forget about it and your strategy was to be quiet and hope that the Scandal blew over hope that everyone would get lost in turkey and be too tired and talk about it but what actually happened was that hashtag Valencia with lunch hour groomers kept trending all weekend and then your name started trending and you realize about the third time that I hit you on Instagram and millions of people were in your comments saying comment on Balenciaga but it wasn't going to go away so you then drummed up this statement let's keep going and see what you said she goes on to say as a mother of four I have been shaken by the disturbing images the safety of children must be held with the highest regard and any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society period okay I agree with that wonderful that is no place in our society it needs to be condemned we're not going to normalize it give it to me Kim tell us you're done with Valencia no that's not what she does he's not going to do that here's what she says next she says I appreciate balenciaga's removal of the campaigns and apology in speaking with them I believe they understand the serious seriousness of the issue and will take the necessary measures for this to never happen again as for my future with Balenciaga I am currently re-evaluating my relationship with the brand basing it off of their willingness to accept accountability for something that should have never happened to begin with and the actions I'm expecting to see them take to protect children that's it so what she did there was she said as a mother so that we would all go oh yes yes I'm a mom I feel you I love you Kim what else and then she said I'm still gonna wear Balenciaga I'm still going to wear Balenciaga because they apologize and they took down the images and now I'm telling you guys that you need to forget about it because they took accountability for their child pornography so guys forget about the pedophiles because if a pedophile gets caught or a pornographer gets caught and they and apologize like you know they just come out and say I'm sorry that you caught me with Kitty porn that it's I'm coming upon you guys to forget about it and move on oh and by the way I'm re-evaluating my relay look I mean how many times has a celebrity PR person going to keep using that word what it really means when they say I'm re-evaluating it means I'm giving it some time for you guys to forget about it and waiting for the next Scandal to come on to come about that you guys will leave me alone and I can continue to drip myself in Balenciaga up and get free money and get I mean get bags and get money and get cash and get sponsors with them and get invited to their shows because I'm Kim Kardashian and I don't have a soul I literally stop everybody stop pretending that Kim Kardashian has a soul I'm done with this I'm done with the idea that every time she cries it's good she's really hurting the only thing that hurts Kim Kardashian is the idea that she's not going to be invited to the Met Gala is the idea that she's not going to become more famous is the idea that she's not going to be able to call up Anna went torn she's not going to make it on the cover of Vogue okay I told you before that she prostitutes herself for being presented since the very beginning okay she's willing to go so far in continuing that relationship with Fame that child pedophilia and pornography is does not disrupt this girl for a single second okay what she is dealing with right now is trying to figure out how to make you all forget about it so that you still buy her skims and her skin products you still see her her as a victim of everything she's a victim she's just going to ride out the wave absolutely despicable and no we're not gonna just forget about it Kimmy we're going to keep the heat on you because as a mother of two as I am this is where I draw the line and I think that you need to be called out for your selfishness it is easy to walk away from Balenciaga and Adidas okay they did it to your husband in about 30 seconds after one tweet it is easy for you to walk away and to not just say it but to mean it that you condemn child grooming and pedophilia alright guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be

[Music]", "iy_4svZCXlU": "ladies and gentlemen it is my distinct honor to welcome back dr robert malone who is going to discuss monkey pox with us exactly what it is exactly what it isn't i hope that you guys enjoy this discussion i guess what i want to do right now is to just give you guys a live what is monkey pox monkey pox and small pox for dummies because the only way they're going to triumph your fears is if you have a real understanding of what it is that we are even facing so dr robert malone take it away what's the most important thing to understand at the start is that there's a lot of pictures being shown about smallpox by legacy media and there's a lot of talk about monkey pox being related to smallpox it's true that it is related but monkeypox and many other viruses in this same category as smallpox are not very risky for humans they are associated with a variety of different animals there's a cow pox that was used to vaccinate people this is how edward jenner is credited with coming up with the first smallpox vaccines there's camel pox there's horse pox there's many other of these pox viruses that are not lethal in the same way that smallpox was this monkey pox is something which has been indigenous in africa for probably millennia it was first it detected in 1958 in a monkey troop and colabus monkeys and so that's why it has the name but it actually infects a lot of other animals particularly rodents now there was an outbreak of monkey pox in the united states in 2003. so we've been down this we've seen this movie before what happened in that case was some african uh deep pouched rats and other rodents were imported into the united states and somehow they got contact with the prairie dog population in the midwest and the prairie dogs got infected with the monkey pox and they spread it all over their uh prairie prairie dog towns um that there was some people infected i don't recall there were any deaths so monkey pox is something which can infect humans it resides in many different animals particularly in africa there are two major groups of monkey pox viruses we call them clades one is a congo clade and one is a west african clade summertime is almost here you know what that means it's grilling season i personally cannot wait to break out all of my grill gear and to cook up some american wagyu burgers from food ranchers when you use my coat candice at checkout you'll get two pounds free of wagyu beef you can make so much more than burgers with this ground wagyu beef i'm doing tacos meatballs and maybe even a stir fry there are so many options not only is the meat absolutely delicious but the guys behind good ranchers are incredibly proud hard-working americans they're all about connecting quality american products to american people they're firm believers that everyone deserves to know where their meat comes from and that each person should be able to afford it so get two pounds of free wagyu burgers what are you waiting for use my code candace or visit foodventures.com candace plus this month 50 listeners who purchase good ranchers with code candice will be eligible to attend a private 30-minute zoom call with me on june 9th that's promo code candace at goodranchers.com candace the west african clade is the less risky clade for humans and what is infecting people that have been at these two big parties or the people they've taught contacted that being the party in spain and the party in belgium where this all got kicked off those people are all infected with the west african blade and so that's the least of the two the clinical presentation starts off with flu-like symptoms you can spread monkey pox through uh cough or spittle that's true it does stay on your body when you're infected and so you can infect others by close contact that's why it's not that it's carried in semen uh or that body fluids are particular risk it's the it's the virus on the surface the mucus and particularly the little pustules that often form on people's hands are around people's hands that get a crust on them a lot like chicken pox those things are all highly infectious they're full of virus and so people that have been infected need to be kept quarantined for about 25 days while the illness takes its course just those people not everybody but the people around them their family members etc need to not touch them and they need to wear protective clothing when they help their family member or friend who might be infected but this is absolutely not a major public health threat it is something which can easily be contained through classic public health measures like track and trace and quarantine thanks for joining me on this segment of candice if you like this video subscribe to this youtube

could they be angry about it's The Adams Family everybody loves Wednesday she's perpetually not happy while they're angry because in this reboot they cast black people but those black actors are the bullies and so that's problematic and it's problematic it's problematic if you don't cast black people of course that's racism but it's also problematic if you do cast black people of course that's racism so basically you got to figure out how not to be a racist and there there's no new as you are no matter what going to be a racist but you've got to work to not be racist in a world where everything is racist so if you move into a black neighborhood you're gentrifying it and that's racist but if you move out of a black neighborhood that's the white flight and that's also racist you got to figure out where to live no matter where you live it's going to be racism because it's everywhere and it's abundant and obviously Tim Burton is a racist so this Twitter user who happened to be named Jack not Dorsey wrote quote Tim Burton casts black people finally and makes them Pilgrim villains y'all can't tell me that man isn't insufferable and racist as hell in real life um uh you're correct I can't tell you that I can tell you you're probably insufferable Tim Burton as I remember him just kind of makes people a weird spooky color he's got like he's like Adam's family is right on par with Tim Burton because he does cartoons and I don't know when we started racializing cartoons or why there's so much beef in these non-existing characters but here we are because we have a bunch of people that can't enjoy The Adams Family which everybody enjoyed so there you go it's ruined here's another person's tweet don't get me wrong I love Jenna Ortega in that she's playing Wednesday but one thing I hate about this show is that why did they make all the black people in the show terrible people the disgruntled Twitter user wrote like how did Netflix see nothing wrong with this here's the thing The Adams Family in general I don't really think there's any nice characters it's The Adams Family so I think everyone's a little dark Wednesday's depressed child so if there's a white person cast that's Wednesday why they gotta make the white people the depressed child let's just keep being upset about everything and by the way what about the hand the little hand Critter like well I mean who wants to just be a hand who just wants to be a freaking hand that's been chopped off from an arm okay there's really no really warm characters in The Adams Family so I'm not really sure what you guys are upset about but I'm never really sure what you guys are upset about so there is that all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus

choice but to discuss the slap heard around the world okay nobody watches the oscars anymore but over the weekend all of that changed when millions of people worldwide began circulating a clip of actor will smith jumping on stage to slap the comedian host chris rock across the face for making a joke about smith's wife jada pinkett smith the joke was something to the effect that her new low haircut looked like she was looking to be cast in a gi jane sequel a pretty light-hearted joke by any metric but but unbeknownst to chris rock and also to me and i'm sure millions of other viewers around the world who are used to seeing jada with a low haircut jada is apparently suffering from a condition known as alopecia which contributes to balding now here is what's odd about the clip when chris rock first makes the joke will laughs meaning that he takes the joke as it was intended lightly but then he looks over and he sees that his wife does not find the joke funny and he immediately goes from an amused attendee to a thug life husband defending the honor of his wife's hair so he hops on stage and rather dramatically slaps chris across the face then he returns to his seat and he screams keep my wife's name oucho effin mouth much to the horror of attendees who are all at once realizing that no no this isn't a joke he's not kidding around the internet was understandably outraged by the act of violence and making things more awkward will smith subsequently won his first oscar for his performance in the film king richard now in the aftermath there have been calls to have the oscar award rescinded regarding which the academy has not yet made an official decision there have also of course been countless internet jokes and memes made at his and chris rock's expense jesse waters of fox news probably said it best when he offered that this is the first time we have seen the media actually cover black on black crime but through all of these jokes and the rampant commentary that's being offered there is a conversation that is being neglected a truer assessment of what we observed on that oscars stage for the first time we saw the real will smith not a fresh prince not a survivor of a zombie apocalypse and i am legend not a crime-fighting cop in the movie bad boys or the hancock superhero but the real will smith an incredibly broken man and the residual product of a directionless society that is filled with them the kind of society that produces men that look to their more domineering wives with their tails planted firmly between their legs for instruction on what and who they ought to be in every room the truth is that off the big screen will smith has been spiritually annihilated by his wife don't forget it was jada pinkett smith who openly shared with the world how she cheated on her husband remember and with who her son's friend yeah jada carried out an extra marital affair with a young man who was at first friends with her son then she dragged her puppy dog husband out onto the world stage and told the public while making him sit through it listen to it and agree that she had the right to do what she did don't believe me take a look yourself during that time launched into an interaction with august what do you feel like um you were looking for i just wanted to feel good it had been so long since i felt good right i feel like that husband like i'm with you at the press conference hello husband now i got to be with you at the press conference while you like to tell the world about your transgressions like i love i love my baby i'ma stand by my baby no matter what well you know i definitely i definitely understand um why it would look that way or feel that way but i actually don't look at it as a transgression at all the takeaway from this interview was that they together represented some newer more progressive form of what it means to be in a marriage which is to say not being in a real marriage at all will smith today is someone who should be pitied not prosecuted in a courtroom or even persecuted in the public eye but pitied by every person who has the clarity to see how our society as sponsored by the perversion of these hollywood types is falling apart will smith is what jordan peterson cautions against he's nothing more than a casualty in the great war against masculinity g.i jain by the way for those of you who haven't seen the 1997 movie tells the story of a woman being integrated into the all-male space of the united states military it is the inspired tale of the loss of one woman's femininity to meet the grueling physical demands of the more masculine environment that she finds herself in and so though perhaps not the punch line that chris rock had intended i have to agree that yes jada pinkett would be the perfect individual to play that role in the remake and not because of her hair obviously but because of her success in stripping her husband of any trace understanding of what it means to be a real man and let me tell you will isn't slapping a man across the face because your wife tells you to i'm sorry to say that real manhood is not one on a stage at the oscars with a meaningless trophy rather real manhood begins and ends in your own household it starts with the first step of being able to accurately identify what a good man what a good woman and what a good meaningful relationship even is and with that we wish you luck will on your real-life pursuit of happiness", "A5zyID-GmFw": "all right guys it's time for some questions first up Candace what is your response to Black lives Matter's tweets about your documentary here are the tweets they read today or someday soon Candace Owens will release a purported documentary that will attempt to further divide black people and uplift white supremacy we will continue investing our community to turn the moral tide of the world against policing jails prisons and violence we will continue to ensure the narratives around the globe are as abolitionist and black as possible we will continue to create structures that allow for the fullness of black joy to be experienced I love that so much I mean this just is exactly what I wanted I put pressure on them they gave a statement what the statement actually worked to do was to fire people even more about the documentary because they realized that BLM was scared that Patrice is in hiding she's deleted all of her socials they're coming out to preempt people we don't care what Candice says from this so-called documentary we're still going to do what we do best which is scam people watch my documentary proved it has nothing to do with black America at all we were just their plot line so they could line their own pockets and so they could ruin black American communities and every single person that watches the documentary will understand that so please black lives matter feel free to continue the free promotion of this amazing documentary I love it I love it it is exactly as I said what we were seeking to accomplish next question do you talk much about your Caribbean Roots we know about your grandfather being an amazing man working as a sharecropper what about your Island Family Care to share do you visit them often actually the last trip that my grandfather and I did when he was alive was last year and the entire family went to St Thomas and we rented a house and got to spend that last time with him I do talk a lot about my Caribbean Roots I guess I could talk more about it I definitely spoke about it in my book because my grandparents had such an amazing impact on my life my grandmother is from St Thomas and in fact it's so funny that people are so stupid that online one of the themes against me is Candace isn't even black American she's from the Caribbean it's like no I have one grandparent that is from the Caribbean and I have one grandparent that's from a sharecropping Department in the South so it's just utterly stupid to suggest that I'm not black American when I am American I was born in this country um but yeah I actually and this is a fact uh Caribbean Americans are a more successful group of people so I think that it must be my Caribbean roots that compels me not to accept narratives that are given to me by the media I really do believe that there's something about Caribbeans that were less inclined to believe a lot of the lies and that's also true of Africans African true African-Americans not black Americans but African-Americans when we have immigrants they're an incredibly successful group Caribbean Americans and true African Americans are successful when they come here and that is because maybe we just perceived this to be a land of opportunity and we don't allow these oppression narratives to work on us so I have a lot of Caribbean pride and I also think Rihanna is a vibe just wanted to say that I think Nicki Minaj is a vibe and just wanted to say that Caribbean Girls Unite next can you please elaborate on why you do not use Mac products what products of Mac did you use and what did they do I use Mac and I have found it burns my face looking for Alternatives love you from your biggest fan in Australia Bree I should elaborate on this in fact I should probably elaborate on this in front of the paywall because you know how girls are with their skin and it is very important that we share the truth about products that are burning our skin it was specifically the Mac Studio fix fluid it gave me cystic acne and then when it gave me cystic acne I didn't know what it was and actually my assistant at the time was like she picked it up out of my thing after months of me like being so frustrated about the cystic acne she said you're not using this are you and I said yeah I am and she said this is known to give you cystic acne and then I went on YouTube and I found so many other people talking about how their Studio fix fluid had given them all these breakouts so I was horrified I stopped using it and my acne corrected within a few months but it is the devil Mac Studio fix fluid is a devil I honestly should do product reviews my Instagram in the way that Bethenny Frankel is doing hers where she just uses products and is like this is horrible this is great because people need to know because Marketing in general can be such a lie and people just want to make a quick Buck but when it comes to your skin it is a sin to be lied to like it really is like people that lie about skin products and force people to buy them or encourage people to buy it and then it inspires like acne like cystic acne there's a special place in health for people like that what I use on my skin today um I do like Nars products so that's what I use on my personal like when I'm traveling when I get my makeup done by my makeup artist she actually just this week started using Lady Gaga's new brand I don't even know what it's called but it works really well on my skin I haven't had a breakout so that's what I will share with you I could talk about beauty products all day but I know that there's a lot of men that are watching this that could not be less interested so I'm gonna stop right there thank you for joining me today come back tomorrow for an all new episode I will see you then [Music] thank you", "H0NY3VWpP8k": "moving on to something that is so despicable it's hard to even imagine that this is real and first I'm just going to allow Tucker Carlson to explain to you exactly uh what was found in this Balenciaga campaign so Balenciaga as you know is a high fashion brand and they're facing backlash for an ad campaign that features photos of child models that are holding teddy bears that are dressed in bondage gear but that is not all the brand also uses an image of a supreme court opinion and I'm going to let Tucker Carlson take it away but it's not just the sexual mutilation of children in hospitals this is part of a larger Trend and the trend is this adults crossing the line and it has always been a bright line into deep involvement with the sexuality of children that has always been and must in a civilized society always be the most forbidden thing it's considered unacceptable even among prison enemies but now it seems to be growing in its prevalence consider the latest ad for the clothing brand Balenciaga this was just uploaded on Instagram as you can see the photo shoot they're using to sell their products features a young girl holding a teddy bear in a bondage outfit then in case you missed the point the photo shoot also contains this image it shows several documents most of them aren't visible but what you can see when you zoom in and of course the point is that you see it is a reference to a U.S Supreme Court case called Ashcroft versus Free Speech Coalition that case struck down a law against kiddie porn what is this well it is what it appears to be it's an endorsement of kitty porn of child pornography what else could it be we wanted to know so we reached out today to Balenciaga to get their explanation and they didn't respond so we're going to have to take that on face value and ask where's the moral outrage we have an entire industry in this country comprised of moral outrage merchants if you've ever been on Twitter you know what we mean truly an entire sector of our economy is devoted to attacking people for falling short of the mark and here is a high-end retailer promoting kiddie porn in an ad on Instagram and nobody notices there's no boycott there's no front page New York Times editorial against it and of course Instagram let the advertisement run endorsing Kitty porn and by the way if you have an alternate explanation for what this was let us know a child with a teddy bear in a bondage outfit and a Supreme Court decision striking down a kitty porn law displayed on the table what is that are we jumping to conclusions don't think so it is what it appears to be it's right in your face and no one's saying anything so well said where is the moral outrage I mean I can't even process that you know what celebrity should be speaking out on this Kim Kardashian she's one of the many faces of Balenciaga she drips herself in it head to toe the Kim Kardashian that says that yay is crazy when he rants against the fact that he believes that his children are being exposed to pornography right that he believes that his children are being sexualized she says that's crazy and that's rantings okay well Kim where's your voice because we know you like to use it you use it against Kanye West himself recently you said that you do not condone anything that inspires anti-Semitism okay where is your voice to say that you do not condone pedophilia do you have that voice are you too afraid not to be invited to the Vogue parties are you too afraid not to be invited to balenciaga's show where is your voice is it to me it's noticeably absent and this is what it means to be in Hollywood right people are so obsessed with being dressed by designers by wearing the top luxury brands that they will intentionally turn the other cheek when one of them is now experimenting with child pedophilia via an ad Shoot and they're not even having to answer any questions because why should they why would Balenciaga answer any questions when they know that every single one of these perverted celebrities will stand by them because they are never outraged when it comes to children we have long known that Hollywood has hidden pedophilia that many Executives have been arrested for engaging in pedophilia from Nickelodeon to Disney that a lot of these kids that go into Hollywood end up getting molested or harmed or raped that is the truth about Hollywood and why is it happening because there's a culture of Silence that allows for it to take place it is absolutely sickening I intend to be allowed use my platforms loudly to speak out against this because Balenciaga is not going to get away with this all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be playing a game of Thanksgiving this or

about today in our news Roundup is this very weird story and of course more details are going to come out about it but for University of Idaho students were found dead in their off-campus home that they shared and all the police officers are saying is that it was a crime of passion they won't say anything else the students names were Ethan Chapin Madison Mogan Zannah kernodle and Kaylee goncalves they were 20 21 20 and 21 respectively and they were all found dead in the house that they shared in Moscow Idaho on Sunday and again the police nor the parents are disclosing how exactly they died it's obviously a tremendously sad situation I do know for a fact that there was no guns involved of course or you would know Democrats would be marching about gun legislation there was one individual that was on Twitter who was tweeting up a daily wire saying that he had more details and we have reached out to him regarding it because it's just a story that of course with wanting to fully respect the parents that are involved and are going through this tremendous tragedy it's something that we want to share to the public because it's scary the idea you could send your child to a college campus and that all of them would die again uh I I would think if I had seen the story and hadn't seen the phrase Crime of Passion that it was related to a drug overdose but that would is obviously wrong because why would they refer to it as a crime of passion so what I said is purely speculative but we are following this story the police are saying that they're still trying to narrow down exactly what it is that happened it's one of a plenitude of possibilities including a burglary gone wrong or a robbery gone wrong any of those is a possibility and not one to the exclusion of others again incredibly vague statement which came from the police and we should all be paying attention to that story I do also want to move into providing you guys an update on the story you know we covered it's just such a bizarre story and I think it's because they've been piecemealing information and it's very rare for for four campus University students to die and for the police to be so tight-lipped about how they died and they were describing it as a crime of passion absent any details and the reason why I find it very necessary for them to give us more details on how these students died at the University of Idaho is because a lot of parents are rightfully traumatized you could only imagine what it is like to wake up knowing that your young child goes to University that this could have been them and you're not getting any information as to how all four of these children these students died on campus in their homes and they're just calling it a crime of passion they're not saying whether or not they've caught the individual that was behind this well I was able to reach out to someone who was commenting on the story on Twitter who does attend the University I was able to confirm his identity he is a student there and he is friends with one of the victims and he did not want to come on the show obviously because this is a tragedy and he did not want to look like someone who was you know I guess trampling over the friends and the family members of these victims but he did provide you with a little more information and we have since seen it reflected in the media it seems today that these University students it was a stabbing a very tragic stabbing and still not sure who was behind the stabbing but he did inform me that both people that are in sororities were told that they could not the University Police could not keep them safe at this time that they were unwilling to say that they that they were safe and so everybody is essentially up and left the university and he is one of these people they've just left because they don't feel safe and it's a very dark story but yes a person close to the investigation said that there was blood everywhere on dailymail.com they released blood that was actually leaking outside of the home so it seems incredibly violent dribbling down the side of the house and just a tremendous tremendous tragedy they are describing it as a one-off situation type situation so who knows uh what led to these events nothing could ever justify obviously what has happened here we don't know if it was a crime of passion or a burglary burglary gone wrong but I promise us to keep you guys up to date on the many possibilities that are happening and we will continue to try to get more information as it becomes available all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Northwest doing makeup tutorials on Tick Tock so if you are not a member

next story involves me and Patrice colors remember Patrice colors she is the founder of black lives matter the movement is all about Black lives put tons of money give donate money to rinse yourself of white guilt well I've been working on a documentary about Patrice colors I've been wondering I've been asking I've been searching for the answer to this question black lives matter reported to have raised more than 90 million dollars on the back of George Floyd and other black people that died at the hands of police as they say and no one seems to be able to account for the dollars so I thought I would like to take a look at this Patrice jumped on Instagram as we were recording this and I was outside of her home and here is her explaining um what took place this morning I woke up to Candace Owens being outside of my house with a news crew um she was demanding that I come outside um and uh when I looked at the video recording of what she was asking about she was actually asking about the black lives matter Global Network Foundation property uh and for some reason seems like she thought my house was that um it's unacceptable and it's dangerous that anybody any stranger come outside of my house but it's really unacceptable and dangerous when Candace Owens another black woman who is actually working as a part of a sounds like Patrice is afraid of black people that seems like a little bit of racial profiling Patrice you might want to check that first and foremost she's a liar we know this it's why I've nicknamed the movement black lives matter she starts out by saying I woke up to Candace Owens outside of my house it was about 10 a.m Patrice you're lazy and it obviously had no idea she was inside she contradicts herself when she retells the story first she says Candace demands that I come outside that never absolutely never happened but she's trying to create this imagery of her being afraid and scared and me going Patrice callers come outside but then she immediately jumps and says Candace didn't know where she was at and she was asking if this was the residence that black lives matter brought up the purchase so that black people could as she said in the press and black lives matter have a creative space to create videos those two ideas conflict with one another it is true that I showed up at one of the many million dollar residences um that are connected to black lives matter I had no idea that Patrice callers lived there I had no idea that she was inside uh there were no demands made there was a security car a security guard that was outside uh who happened to be white might be relevant and I simply asked him if there was anyone available that we could speak to about the purchase of this home all right guys digital eye strain you all know what I'm

or high-end home I was at I just want to take you through Patrice colors real estate Empire that she's been building in the background of the black lives matter movement okay so she spent 3.2 million dollars on high-end homes between 2016 and 2021 at the peak of the movement in 2016 she bought a home in Inglewood California for five hundred and ten thousand dollars in 2018 she purchased a 590 000 home in South Los Angeles in January February she purchased a four hundred and fifteen thousand dollar custom Ranch in Conyers Georgia which features a private airplane Hangar that sounds nice in 2021 she purchased a 1.4 million dollar home in exclusive Los Angeles neighborhood of Topanga Canyon that's the one that I was at in 2022 they spent nearly six million dollars this is the organization directly in their donations to purchase a 6500 square foot California mansion and they made the purchase through an intermediary named Dwayne Pascal who is the Financial Manager for an LLC owned by black lives matter co-founder Patrice cullers and her wife speaking of her wife BLM Canada in the summer of 2021 purchased a three-story Victorian Mansion in Toronto to turn it into a ten thousand dollar square foot art center and a meeting space the 6.3 million Mansion was bought by m4bj in case you're wondering what that is it's an acronym for a Toronto based non-profit set up by Janaya Khan the wife of Patrice colors all of this seems a little bit shady and by the way that six million dollar mansion that's 6 500 square foot one I should mention that Patrice recently came out and confessed that she lied you know they told us it was for arts and crafts and creative activities for the black lives matter Community well she came out after I showed up at her place and said actually you know what I lied and we actually have been using this for some other things some other things including her son's birthday party her young son's birthday party and also they hosted a party to celebrate the inauguration of Joe Biden I thought she said she was scared for her kids who throws a celebration for Joe Biden if you've got any fear regarding children but none of those facts actually matter to Patrice she actually was able to work herself up into what I would describe as a histrionic personality disorder maybe and made herself cry on Instagram take a look y'all I really need my family to be safe I need to be safe I need my child to be safe and this this what happened this morning is not safety it's not what I deserve it's not what any of us deserve yeah I really need my child to be safe there's an eight-month pregnant woman outside asking politely uh if she can speak to somebody and I don't know why I'm still sleeping and my child's not even here but I hope that you believe these non-tears that are coming down my face here's what actually happened when I showed up at her house take a look I did see some powers that were loaded so there's definitely somebody home hello um I was just looking to speak to whoever is at this property because it's listed as the black lives matter property sir hello are you instructed not to speak to anybody we're not trying to harass you we'll gladly leave we're just wondering if we can speak to anybody thank you sir have a great day so the moral of this Saga is that Patrice cullers continues to lie black lives matter continues to lie and the reason that she's lying and trying to squeeze out these last victim crocodile tears is because she knows the truth is coming I've been working on this documentary for months to expose black lives matter it has frustrated me being a person that has always been telling the truth about what they were doing obviously what looked to me to be a money laundering scheme was not exposed but it seems finally the world is ready to hear the truth and they can do so when they watch my documentary which I'm doing with the daily wire and it is going to get so much worse for this organization when people realize just how fraudulent they've been thanks for joining me on this segment of Candace if you like this video subscribe to this YouTube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new videos to watch or listen to the full show become a member at dailywire.com subscribe", "M4W3HJ3X96Y": "okay so the first installment of Harry and Megan which is obviously Prince Harry and Meghan markle's new Netflix documentary premiered last night and I did not watch it because I didn't need to watch it I knew exactly what was going to happen in this documentary series I actually told you guys last week what was going to happen because it's Meghan Markle is just the most predictable person in the entire world she's very predictable I knew throughout their entire relationship because I do believe that she's an emotionally abusive person that she is embarking on 40 and transfer she is using a real childhood trauma that Prince Harry suffered from losing his mother and she has used it to further harness him to her and their relationship she has convinced him he actually believes that Meghan Markle is Princess Diana okay so in case you missed it the documentary it turns out Meghan Markle is Princess Diana that's what she wants you guys to know she is Princess Diana and fortunately for Prince Harry this time he got to save his mom I mean how sick is that me even saying that it sounds so sick but this is actually what is taking place so here are some quotes of what he said and the reason why he responds to Meghan markle's compassion and quote warmth is because it's just like his late mother this is from Prince Harry quote so much of what Megan is and how she is is so similar to my mom she has the same compassion she has the same empathy she has the same confidence she has this warmth about her that is disturbing on so many levels of disturbing it's disturbing because this is something that I didn't want to be right about but it was so obvious and it was one quotation that she had given a while ago where she said that she was I think she was about seven months pregnant and this is when they were still within the royal family and she said that she told him that she was going to kill herself but she wasn't gonna do it but she knew while he was gone he was at some event and he got home and she said I was going to kill myself but I didn't do it because I didn't want you to suffer the same thing that you suffered with your mom she actually came out and said that she said this to him so I'm picturing a woman that is seven months pregnant with somebody's child and saying I was just about to kill myself but I know what you went through with your mom I didn't want you to suffer again and that obviously triggered because it's so emotionally abusive it triggered Prince Harry and that became the reason that they left the royal family and any person I somebody tweeted or actually earlier today they said I don't see how any person can watch this documentary and not feel extreme compassion for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and I don't understand if you if you feel if you don't feel compassion you have a Heart of Stone I'm paraphrasing but that was essentially the tweet and I have tremendous compassion I have tremendous compassion for any person that isn't an emotionally abusive relationship so emotionally abusive that they have successfully isolated you from your entire family it's not normal there's no relationship that you should be in that should isolate you from your entire family okay and the fact that he is in one that she is convincing him that their extreme gaslighting of the world is not taking place remember they left they issued statements and they did interviews all about the pursuit of their own privacy that's all they ever wanted what extreme gaslighting that everything that they have done to say left has been public you do not pursue your privacy with Oprah it's just not how you do it you just don't do it in a sit-down interview with Oprah and I would I would believe that truly they just wanted to help people by sharing their story if they weren't being paid 100 million dollars to do it right if they were just about wanting to share their story they'd be going around and doing doing charity and speaking to people that are dealing with issues and forms of emotional abuse within their own families they are doing this for money while gaslighting you and trying to convince you that they're doing it because they have a heart and they have compassion the only person that you should feel bad for in this story and allow me to remind you that he also lost his mother is Prince William because what his brother is doing is so twisted and again I don't think he's doing it to be evil I believe the person that is behind this perpetuating this is Meghan Markle she's smarter than him she is more conniving than him and he just cannot see the writing that is on the wall he cannot see that when you lose all of your friends and all of your family and you're ushered to America in Hollywood with a d-list actress it is because you are under the spell of a witch I do believe that she is a witch and she has cast a spell and the person that is suffering is Prince William as his brother does this as his brother digs up these old horrible memories for prophets I mean how sick and how twisted it is a family we have to spiritually protect family family is sacred and the way that he is treating it is so narcissistic and so Hollywood and so elitist because they don't have values and principles in Hollywood everything goes to the highest bidder they will sell their children they will sell their brother who is over there knowing that his brother cannot speak out on this Netflix documentary but they cannot respond that him and his wife and how it is impacting them and their family and their children who are seeing this in the Press day in and day out they're convincing you that all they wanted to do was run away from the Press right she's just like Princess Diana guys Princess Diana was killed because the Press just wouldn't leave her alone that's what Meghan Markle has done is pursued the most pressed in the form of a Netflix documentary the most possible question you could possibly receive and want you to believe that it's because all she wanted to do was to escape them and here's what's especially sick and I want to add this to it so Prince William came right out and said last year that the interview that took place between his mother remember his mother was conned into giving an interview that she was not aware of from a journalist at the he is a disgrace journalist named Martin beshear he completely conned her in 1995 and it was the interview was very famous because she spoke out about her husband Prince Charles but she wasn't aware that she was doing it so this interview became synonymous with how it taken advantage of she was by the Press Prince William again said that he never wanted to see this interview see the light of day ever again it was it was traumatic for him to see this interview being played because he's watching his mother being taken advantage of who sold the interview again well his brother Prince Harry sold to Netflix and they premiered parts of that interview in the documentary yesterday it is it is it's despicable it's disgusting and I I just feel that everyone needs to get on board and I see it happening already left and right we are agreeing that there is something that is deeper that is happening here something that's darker that is happening here and this this web is being very carefully woven by Meghan Markle but we should all be able to speak out and realize that this level of intrusion on a family Dynamic that I don't dispute of course families are complicated I have fights with people in my family all the time but to make a hundred million dollars and then 25 million dollars from Spotify talking over and over again pretending that you're the victim when in fact what you are is a shrewd capitalist yeah we we should all be able to renounce them and say that this is this needs to stop and you need to leave Prince William alone because he is the only victim in this story at this point ladies and gentlemen somehow time is already up which means the next portion of the show is going

to join tick-tock i'm going to wear a blue wig and i'm going to be the opposite of canis owens tell me what you think and i'm just going to be super woke and talk trash about conservatives all the time so it's going to be my alter ego you're privileged and i don't know what her name's going to be but she's going to really hate candace owens many people ask me how do you use they them pronouns for a singular person well it's really easy all you have to do is use it the same way that you would talk about a group of people so for example i addison use they them pronouns in that case you talk about me like this i know addison they are amazing their dress and their hair are amazing and i'm so proud to know them now a fun fact about they them pronouns is that they've been used in a singular context for centuries even going back to shakespearean times there's actual documentation and literature using they and them in singular contexts but if that still doesn't convince you to use they them pronoun i'll leave you with this piece of information our language is constantly changing and adapting we're evolving to find new terms and language to self-identify so get with the times don't be an apple okay they them addison rose i mean i don't want to say that i just sometimes think that we have to hit the reset button on humanity and start over i also have this strange urge to meet everyone's parents like i just want to know who raised him are they who raised them that's what i want to know like how did we get here like somebody's parents did not do a good enough job if this is what your child is committed to on the internet it's just who raised them they i took my trans daughter to see her pediatrician for the first time since she has come out as trans i called ahead to give them a heads up and they assured me everything would be okay um when i got there it was it was not okay when we brought up the subject of puberty blockers which we were just asking for information at this point the doctor said oh i do not have any trans patients and i don't know anything about that but then proceeded to ask questions such as have you researched people who regret transitioning no no i haven't because that's not really my concern right now my concern is to make sure my child doesn't turn into a statistic and unalive herself because she's not being loved and validated so we're finding a new doctor honestly this one makes me super upset because in this scenario the doctor should have probably called child protective services um a child like saying saying that there's a child who thinks it's trans it's like saying there's a dog that thinks it's vegan you know who's making the decision children don't think like this um so there's an unstable parent who is forcing upon their child maybe because they think it shows that they're virtuous like look i'm accepting and i'm a great parent because my child wants puberty blockers but in reality that's what the parent wants um so good on the doctor for making you know i guess kind of edging them and in the right direction by saying have you heard of trans regret but the fact that this is a child uh there was i mean when i was growing up no child knew what trans was nobody thought about that like so the fact that this child is young enough that they're at a pediatrician um talking about puberty blockers means that there is a mother that needs to be removed from the care of that child before we continue let's talk about protecting your retirement inflation is already running hot and now the dems are raising the debt ceiling so here's the deal if you think money grows on trees like our government does then just keep living in ignorance but if you're freaked out about the impact additional

particularly wall tire came on my show i've had him multiple times on various shows and the statistic that she probably needs to be paying most attention to are the ones about trans regret and it is usually because um as well tire told me because they're forced into making a decision uh because you have an entire ecosystem of people the parents the doctors that are complicit and making them make a radical decision that in the end will ruin their lives you know your child will not be able to procreate i can't even imagine putting a small child on puberty blockers that means this means the age of his child's talking about this child has not even gone through puberty yet and they're trying to talk you know they're trying to discuss blocking that puberty from taking place i mean this what you're looking at is worse than a radical you can be a radical unto thyself this woman is harming a child and this tick tock account should be removed this woman should be investigated but that would all be happening in a sane world i wear a mask to school i wear a mask to school hi ho the it helps to keep me safe it helps to keep me safe hi ho the derry-o it helps to keep me safe it keeps my friends safe it keeps my friends safe hi ho the derry-o it keeps my friends safe and let me see a hooray put your hands up in the air like the kids are not singing along because they're not enjoying the song and they're not enjoying wearing a mask and you're creepy for trying to make this into a fun song i mean it again it just it hurts my heart to see children being abused as as funny as you want to find this like insane teacher like we are now suddenly an era in society where we're just watching child abuse take place and whether it's because you're it's always under the guise of health like trans children it's help it's all about their health no it's not it's about unstable adults that are forcing children perfectly great children to make decisions about their lives masking children it's about health no it's obviously not about health since we know that less than 500 children have died from covenant and those 500 children by the way had co-morbidities like terminal cancer right and they're counting them as cova deaths so um this is just what happens when society to me uh is just on the wrong trajectory and i i mean i hope eventually those babies are freed i hate seeing stuff like this it just it hurts my heart why does it matter oh it doesn't matter to you i'm so i mean but to me i'm a male okay okay so what are you so i can call you sir or ma'am what are you what would you assume looking at me what are you what would you assume looking at me i assume that you're a man okay [Laughter] okay thank you whatever there's nothing i can say about that that's not gonna get me in trouble on youtube so i'm just gonna have a nice laugh and move on i'm gonna say this because i don't think enough people are if the vaccine was dangerous they would have rolled it out in black and brown poor communities first not the billionaires not every single living us president not every single u.s governor every single one um it would have been the poor people first so i don't know what she's talking about it literally was the poor people first they remember all the initiatives they were like we should let black and brown people get the uh shot first especially i think it was in maine or vermont where they were actually trying to put in place policies to encourage black people to get it first it's just that black people um were a bit wiser to the corruption of the fda and the cdc given the history of the tuskegee experiments and things of that nature that have taken place where you know people have the government has said they've tried to help black and brown people first and it hasn't turned out so well for black and brown people um so she doesn't know what she's talking about um she's just talking about all people that got the shot on camera and i don't even know how real or authentic any of that stuff was so uh yeah they tried they just failed yes chairs let's talk about chairs uh full pun intended chairs are the biggest issue in the fat community um the amount of public spaces like doctor's offices malls what the ever places that have seating restaurants etc never ever have accessible seating some places just have stools or some places just have armed small dinky looking chairs as a fat person if you have never ever done the following things if you have never looked at a picture of a restaurant on google maps to try and figure out if the seating would be accessible to your size if you have never broken a chair in a public space especially um if you've never had to second-guess whether or not it was okay to sit down in the chairs provided to you if you've never had a panic attack at school because you couldn't fit into the god damn chair desk situation then you don't deal with fat phobia at the same level that the rest of us do and this is just one example there are a plethora of other examples i could give you but this one is really really important oh the oppression of chairs man see tick-tock canis would totally agree with him and be like yes we have to stop having chairs i'm sure a guy like him would really want to stand the whole time and not be able to sit at all um yeah i mean this is just more of the crazy the fat acceptance movement has no limits it really does have limits like at no point has it ever occurred to him that he could lose weight it may be able to fit into one of those chairs a little bit better instead we have to get rid of chairs which is going to be really unfortunate for the people that need them like him", "HkcT-FaUmqU": "this week I had a Twitter debate just like I have a Twitter debate every week this time it was with an individual by the name of Serena daniari after we exchanged a few tweets I invited Serena to the show for an open dialogue and I was absolutely thrilled that unlike most people on the left who won't talk to me face to face Serena agreed to join me in person unfortunately after my producers booked Serena's flight and hotel Serena backed out so instead of having that conversation we are going to have this segment of counterpoints so this is where the entire debate began it was actually about vaccines um and Serena came across my rhetoric which she deemed to be anti-vaxx because I've been very open with the fact that I am not comfortable with the rush nature of the covid-19 vaccines or the pressures around getting the vaccines and so I've made a personal decision uh not to get the vaccine this deeply upset Serena Serena tweeted to me you are the one who is deranged and urging your millions of followers that the only true means of preventing a deadly virus that has taken hundreds of thousands of lives is not effective live without fear by all means but to spread delusional lies is morally repugnant and this amazed me it amazed me that Serena called me delusional because in case you did not know Serena is trans so I had stumbled across the internet as somebody uh who is a trans woman who is accusing me of being delusional because I am making a personal decision um regarding my own health and it actually gets even more bizarre Serena went on in this Twitter exchange and of course I answered back and I said I just want to make sure that you're a trans woman telling me that I am a delusional person because I choose not to get a vaccine you believe that between you and I I am living in a delusion is that correct to which Serena answered yes Queen I believe you are delusional while my decision as a trans woman to get breast implants and turn my penis into a vagina impacts literally no one but me you're your choice to deny science and spread anti-vaxx misinformation that spread delusion impacts many denying science a trans woman is accusing me of denying science is biology not science is anatomy not science or none of these things physiology is that not science so this is where we are in 2021 where we are now being preached to about the reality of Science by people that have made decisions to transform their bodies and believe fully that they can actually pick their genders prices are up up and they just keep going up gas milk Lumber have you noticed because I certainly have inflation is here and it is not going away and our government is not prepared their solution is to stick their heads in the sand don't do that protect your savings against inflation by diversifying into gold and silver with Birch gold

and protect your savings today this spat went on it went back and forth and Serena then said I say this to you with an open heart there was no singular experience of Womanhood reducing women to anatomy and reproductive abilities is an insult to so many women trans and sis what about the women who have fertility issues are they less of a woman those with hysterectomies period okay I want to respond to this because it's important I have been a very loud voice against the transgendered movement and I feel that I am one of the few voices that is standing up for women I want to continue to do that right now on Counterpoint so Counterpoint number one is that this culture of the media and the Academia and people pretending that being a woman means to simply walk in and pay for a cosmetic procedure is deeply misogynistic my second Counterpoint to you Serena is that a cosmetic procedure believing that going in and getting breast implants makes you a woman is an insult I'll tell you why because what this trans movement represents is a caricature of what it means to be a woman being a woman isn't just having a procedure and getting your breasts done I don't believe that Dolly Parton is more of a woman because she has extra large breasts I want to give this to you another way and I'll ask the questions do you believe that you can pick your race do you think race is a social construct do you believe that if you dyed your skin black and said yo yo yo what up my N word that would mean that you were suddenly black or would you realize that that would be a caricature of what it means to be black that would be a joke to believe that because you said AO and you rap and you wear a chain and some gold teeth hey I'm black nope that would be an insult and a stereotype and it is an insult in a stereotype to believe that makeup and breasts makes somebody a woman foreign [Applause] to you Serena I would like to address your idea that some women have hysterectomies that's true some women have fertility issues does that make them less of a woman you ask and let me answer that question no it does not make them less of a woman in fact it affirms their Womanhood only women can have hysterectomies only women go through menstruation only women can talk about that struggle of what it's like going through IVF and trying to conceive a child and what pressures that puts on the female body that actually affirms their Womanhood these are experiences that only women can have and when you decide that that means nothing that you can walk in and pick a plastic surgeon and suddenly that makes you me it's deeply hurtful and deeply upsetting and I will continue to be a voice against it foreign thanks for joining me on this episode of Candace if you wish you could come out

hanging on by a thread perhaps the pun intended there after he cheated on her by texting another woman so yep this woman married the rag doll and she is from Brazil she's 37 years old I can't really say her name Maddie vone Roca morayas and she hit the headlines earlier this year after revealing that she had met the love of her life a rag doll and she's admitted that the relationship is not doing too well because of this cheating and it's obviously a very bizarre tale she claims that she caught him cheating when he went to a motel with another woman and she even found the text messages on his phone so I mean as a woman I feel sad for her I couldn't imagine if the ragdoll um I think the inanimate object of the Ragdoll that was in my house and was my husband then I he went to the motel room with another woman and I feel that I would feel sad I feel sad because I can't imagine walking into the motel room and seeing the doll that I bought not on no way not with another woman no not on my clock well that's what happened to this girl and it's very very sad and she was overjoyed of course when they first met each other and she was in love with him that's what she says but then she started to have doubts about their relationship because she is the only breadwinner and they were struggling to pay bills so I mean I am just feeling more bad for this young woman I just I mean it just it sucks imagine not even like you you give him everything you're paying for the electricity you're paying for the water and then all of a sudden you realize um something's getting a little weird and you go to a motel room and there's the Ragdoll texting other women I just like I don't know I want to have this this woman on my show I think that I should have her on a topic of taboo my monthly series I think I should sit down and talk with her and I should talk to her about this incredible betrayal and guys this is going to shock you but you can hear more about these tales on her Tick Tock ah there it is again tick tock it's a network of mentally disordered individuals the kind that Mary ragdolls the kind of think they have 37 genders the kind of individuals that eulogize their fathers and say horrible things about them all for likes and attention I'm gonna wrap this up in the same way that I wrap up every story when it comes to tick tock get your kids off of that social media app or you will suffer the consequences it's like sending them to University okay that's already probably a bad idea but sitting in the University with a tick tock like forget it you're just not gonna get your kid back so you should not do that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus as you guys know I can answer your questions but I only do

now [Music] thank you", "UFlsQobE9Mc": "what it is is black lives matter and I've said it before and I'll say it again it was a psychosis decided upon by the mainstream media narrative there wasn't a signal statistic or data sign that could back up the fact that everybody wanted to have this conversation that was my point it's like what like is more important it's it's a real thing right and then we say if you do not get on board with the fake thing and how dare you bring up a real thing when we are decided already on the fake thing and we have the entire ecosystem the mainstream media we own the celebrities we own the phones we own the apps we've got Apple we've got Google how dare you think you have the audacity to stand up to the button that we just pressed and that's what you did yeah because the way I saw it is that I was very confused by living in England in 2015 and all I'd seen the five years from from the minute I left America after the Sri Lanka war ended and I couldn't talk about it I was like okay I'm leaving you know and from this perspective the way I saw it is that Obama and Hillary Clinton had started the Arab Spring and this entire campaign was going on in the Middle East and then we had all of this other stuff and problems and Isis were popping up in you know Iraq or whatever and you know and they were sort of threatening our comfortable lives in the west as well and all of these conversations were going on on your mainstream media you know this is just the news I was getting at the time and that's where my head was at when I said oh an American Musician who's huge huge like their platform is huge because they toe the line which is what we're already talking about when you toe the line you get to be a billionaire and I said when you're towing the line you can't say hashtag Syrian life matters a hundred percent you just cannot and that's why I was canceled so then if you know that I was at the Super Bowl and I gave the middle finger at the Super Bowl and I was sued for 16 million dollars so I have the right to talk about the Super Bowl because I was affected by the Super Bowl in my personal life and experience so I'm coming from a personal uh place you know so I was like yeah I went on the Super Bowl and I gave a middle finger and I got sued 16 million you know and they said what do you think of Beyonce putting up the Black Fist supporting black panthers at the Super Bowl and it was a it was a hit job and I didn't know but the journalists asked me and I said well she can do that as a black woman but maybe she won't be able to say Syrian life matters you know pointing out the hypocrisy and the irony so I was just saying yes that's fine it's fine because you could be a black woman in mainstream music and you can say I am back which is fine but I was like she also supported openly the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Obama campaign she would not be able to talk about the war in Syria but then the counter-attack that I got and the way they canceled me was to say black people are Muslims too so how dare you say that but that just didn't make sense it never makes any sense so it never makes any sense but I know that that people could be Muslims that's not the point I was making I was specifically making a point about if you are a mainstream artist who politically funds the campaign of this candidate who's then in an engaging a war over here would they speak out about it no what you're saying makes perfect sense it's interesting that you you start this by saying I probably shouldn't even go there I just want to say what you're saying makes perfect sense it's just like what you're saying makes sense because you're probably sometimes questioned your own sanity because I sometimes I say something and I'm like did I just say what I said because the headlines are now have I said something else that I have to go back and listen to what I said and that is the power of the gaslighting machine is that yeah they start to make you I don't know if I should even say anything at all because no matter what you lose by even opening your mouth saying you're not black so you can't speak on it you know is another thing that that has happened since then in a wider um you know it's been that argument of you're not there so you can't talk about it you know like if you leave race out of it you're not a woman so you can't talk about it you're not a man you can't talk about you know like that sort of easy to kind of shut down the thing is is affected culture in in how artists work you know like I see the the newer Generations suffering with this point you know a lot of the people that I work with or come come across they always say that say oh but I'm a white male so I can't touch this subject you know that they say well I I'm a Chinese person so I have to do this and and that sort of box building you know is really interesting to me just giving people power and it's crap because what's interesting is I'm a black woman allowed to say I wanted to bring it up to be like I you know having been on this side where you it's very confusing like also my dad's book when he talks about monetary exploitation he's not talking about monetary exploitation of Indian people specifically it's like no globalization and the globalist system is everyone you know includes everyone so when when you're past a certain point and you see the picture you cannot Define things by race if one people are oppressed in one place and another person's oppressed in the other place is still oppression and you get to see it like that you know and if you identify the oppressor which is which is what the whole BLM thing is you know we're discussing oppression and there's valuable conversations to be had between somebody like me and how the Tamil people who were engaged in an armed struggle you know and this is this was my response is to say if you fast forward some time where do you go with this it would be a black revolution in America you know the the fast forward the thinking of um this racial conversation you know or it's you know in America it's not a territorial thing and it's not an ethnicity thing but it is a racial thing but if you get to the extreme end of this conversation it's a it's a revolution it's a struggle you know it it could be an armed struggle and my dad already thought that and went there in the 70s and set one up and had the Army you know and then within that within the tamils we had four fractions so we had diff you know four different leaders with their four different groups and then they were into fighting so so you can have a Candice Owen you know the leader of black conservatives or you can have the leader of BLM whoever the leader is or Beyonce the leader of black people and they both say okay we need armed resistance and that's what it's about then I can tell you how it ends you know it was a debate that was worth having but nobody wanted the debate this Council comes culture thing that where they made me out to be the racist person was not I felt you know I was like who's at the bottom a bit you know there's so many different people this could be so it just that made me look into it even more you know and and I was like well you have this Elite Class you know you have black Elites and then you have poor black people in America who are controlled by the same mass media narrative as everybody else white people and in the Hispanics and you know they're all in it together like right now is confusing because the vice president is Tamil you know she's Tamil and black so it's that's another thing but we're not allowed to talk to each other because I'm a Tamil and you're black and you have to be in your experience and your narratives and I have to be in my experience and my narrative but we cannot have conversations", "Kg1SA2sDVoc": "I'm sorry that I'm going to share this with you but basically cardi B and Madonna had it out they had they had shared some words with one another one another I'm just going to give you the facts of the story uh Madonna who as we all know is suffering from some undiagnosed mental disorder she's 65 plus she's getting butt implants she's naked on Instagram she's shouting on Instagram about why she can't be naked she just she's a grandma who needs to be naked that's pretty much what I get from Madonna it's a sad way to see somebody's career end but she's always just kind of looking for attention on Instagram that's her thing and so uh on Saturday she was looking for attention on Instagram and she put up a post in her stories and the post said this I'm gonna read it verbatim 30 years ago I published a book called s-e-x in addition to photos of me naked there were photos of men kissing men women kissing women and me kissing everyone I also wrote about my sexual fantasies and shared my point of view about sexuality in an ironic way I spent the next few years being interviewed by narrow-minded people who tried to shame me for empowering myself as a woman I was called a a witch a heretic and the devil now cardi B can sing about her WAP again to remind you guys WAP stands for wet a double s p u s s y now cardi B can sing about her WAP Kim Kardashian can Grace the cover of any Magazine with her naked and Miley Cyrus can come in like a wrecking ball you're welcome dot dot dot dot dot dot clown face to the clown Emoji right so she's calling them all out she's basically calling all the hoes out and being like you're welcome because I was a hoe first right cardi B sees this and she was upset and you would think she would be upset because Madonna basically just said I would I'm a hoe and you're a hoe but I was the first hoe and I would be very upset about that if I was going to be but cardi B is cardi B she was not upset about the whole stuff at all she was upset that that entire caption ended with the clown Emoji because as everybody knows Tis better to be a hoe than a clown Emoji so cardi B came in hot she went on Twitter and she said I literally paid this woman homage so many times because I grew up listening to her she can make her Point without putting the clown emojis and getting slick out of the mouth these icons really become disappointments once you make it in the industry that's why I keep to myself cardi was hurt how dare you use the clown Emoji well totally fine with the whole Tahoe talk but this kind of emoji has got to go and then a fan tweeted she's not mad at what Madonna said if you read the Tweet properly It's the clown Emoji afterwards that's like not hard to comprehend it's not hard to comprehend why cardi B upset I find it kind of personally hard to comprehend but the fans understand that it is the clown emoji that is just a step too far we gotta draw a line in the sand somewhere whap not offensive doing a book called sex men kissing men women kissing women and me kissing everybody not offensive right coming in like a wrecking ball half naked not offensive clown Emoji got to go good thing guys this story actually ends well I know you're upset I know you're discomforted by all this but this is a happy story TMZ always reporting on things that are really important they reported that both artists were actually able to speak on Sunday and clear the air and they have both now expressed their love for one another on Twitter and Madonna tweeted I love you cardi B always have and always will and cardi B followed up with love you followed by a heart emoji not a clown Emoji ladies and gentlemen I think it is clown world but the one thing that we can all recognize at the end of the day is that you need to properly attribute your hoe Behavior okay just make sure you attribute it properly or else some hosts will be mad out there or something we're talking about kids having wealth whether or not they should inherit wealth well if your name is Blue Ivy Carter and your mom is Beyonce who can do no wrong of course and your dad is Jay-Z you can bid on earrings at a charity auction and I'm not talking about 100 200 I'm not talking about what most kids would hope to have one day in their piggy bank actually piggy banks can't even hold a hundred dollars I mean that's pretty small right I am talking about 80 000 and this is not our first time bidding by the way but yes blue IV is holding up a paddle and she is bidding on Lorraine Schwartz diamond earrings to the tune of eighty thousand dollars back in 2019 I told you this is not the first time she was only six years old in 2019 but she bid 19 000 on an acrylic painting of a young Sydney Poitier I hope I'm saying that right and she entered into a bidding war with Tyler Perry so six-year-old Blue Ivy in 2019 was in a bidding war with Tyler Perry and um I believe that Tyler Harry was actually the one uh who ended up taking the acrylic painting in the end why I guess it's a question I'm gonna ask why is do you guys think it's a good thing that Blue Ivy is Raising her paddle and bidding on 80 000 diamonds is that teaching her to live within the realm of reality does that seem like a good life lesson I'm not trying to at all discredit Jay-Z and Beyonce as parents but as I often like to bring up this topic of excess because we have become a society that is driven by excess right we love to see people dripping in diamonds we love to see fast cars is why the Kardashians are so watched because they are constantly giving you excess more more and more people are are basically going into bankruptcy but making horrible financial decisions all the time because they are being sold this idea of excess and wealth everywhere so my question is what does that signal to the rest of the world what does that signal even to Blue Ivy's peers when she gets back from the weekend and I don't know she's at school and I was like what did you do this weekend and somebody says oh I went to the park with my dad it's a normal thing for a 10 year old to do or I had a baseball game it was really fun I hit a home run wow amazing and then Blue Ivy's like I just put up my paddle for eighty thousand dollar Lorraine Schwartz earrings okay that's amazing blue that's really you had a really good weekend I do not think that that is necessarily impressing upon her the right values that she should have I know she's wealthy it's very lucky that she's wealthy I know her parents work hard it's very good that they work hard but I do think that drawing a line somewhere between one and eighty thousand dollars is probably a good thing for parents to be doing next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on where to draw the line

"first up we have this guy as I mentioned in the opening his name is Dylan mulvani Mulvaney doesn't matter it's a man who began publicly identifying as a female just 191 days ago and despite this fact he has recently been invited to speak at the 2022 Forbes power Women's Summit now that is interesting that he is gathered an extensive social media following he did this after he began documenting his creepy fetishized version of what it means to be a girl and so I want you to take a listen to this video that he posted now by the way when you hear this you're going to think it's satire because it seems like he's making a joke but I guess he wasn't take a listen day six six being a girl and today I'm in nature trees I love them water lakes I love them heels they're my hiking heels I love them okay come on Bridges love them coconut water love it not mad just love it wind turbine love it Luke Meadows love them [Music] love ya oh did you see that I gotta get out of here did you see that there's a dragon oh my God never again get me out of here love you so this sounds like and looks like satire as I said you would think that if you saw this video this was a comedian trying to be funny mocking women right this this idea that women just Frolic in a field wearing heels and then go ah I'm scared of a dragonfly it's so scary ah obviously that's not what that's not representative of what women are but if you were a male comedian mocking women you might be able to get a laugh well no actually apparently this person is now going to be invited to speak at a power Women's Summit because Forbes is taking this person seriously and here's what's more bizarre this person virtually had no followers and then suddenly was being heavily promoted by Tick Tock there is this idea you know Tick Tock is a Chinese owned app owned app Chinese is uh the China the China pardon China is obviously a competitor of America and it seems like they are constantly promoting filth Upon Our Youth I think that Tick Tock is the most extreme app when you talk about protecting your psychological immune system you can hardly utter that phrase without thinking that children should not be on tick tock it is absolute garbage it is shortening our attention span but beyond that it is promoting filth like this right now why would the algorithms want you to be taking a look at this why would the algorithms provide steroids to an account like this obviously because they want to promote debauchery they want to make sure the American Youth that are coming up I think this is a good thing that they should aspire to look how many likes you'll get if you are acting like a freak right there's not even a woman that would be frolicking in heels wearing what looks to be a bikini almost a bikini and then screaming about a dragonfly it's it's it's stupid it's an insult to intelligence and yet they made this person so big in such a short time frame that this person is now being invited and awarded by Forbes right how aspirational is that if you act like this if you act like a total wimp if you're bending your gender and you think this is cool look what could happen to you you can get sponsorships you can get invited to Forbes this is what the youth should be focusing on meanwhile of course we know that Tick Tock in China is being used to make sure their youth is smarter right they're getting math equations science equations they're not getting this this of course be banned in China they they recently announced I think I covered this at the end of last year that they were going to pull down any accounts that looked like this because they they do not want their youth to be poisoned with this sort of ideology but in America it's totally fine because the media will reinforce this derivative that it is a good thing it begs the question who is controlling our media why would any media want their youth to be impacted by these sorts of ideas I will leave that as a question for you to consider all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about the new research that proves what I have been saying since day one the covid vaccine can cause serious issues especially for a woman's menstrual cycle so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "uhlkSD1HB9U": "i want to go on to talk about uh this this is amazing we should just we should just watch it this is on tick tock um and it is just going to show you where we are at on the topic of gender watch this tick tock compilation the youth are hanging out on tick tock what are they seeing i am gay are you gay and if not would you like to try to be gay do you know that straight men can have sex with men and not be gay they can there are trans men who who lactate there are those who go by he him different pronouns it is not hurting cis women to say chest feeding but it does hurt those who go by other pronouns to continue to say breastfeeding especially if they have body dysmorphia i don't believe in being straight i don't believe it's possible to be straight the gender binary is a racist cultural construction created by white scientists in the 19th century as a means of showing the supposed superiority of western civilization at being the only culture able to uphold sexual dichotomy gender fluid means my gender changes depending on the day or week or even depending on the hour it also means the pronouns i'm comfortable with can change too you do mess up somebody's pronouns all you need to do is correct yourself and apologize you don't need to fall of yourself saying oh god i totally love transgender people i've seen all four seasons of transparent because no one has seen all four seasons of transparent straight men can be attracted to the sex act but not to the man straight men having sex with men doesn't cancel somebody's heterosexuality any more than a straight woman having sex with a woman cancels her sexuality women are not the only people who give birth trans men and non-binary persons also get pregnant and give birth it's important to include these people when we're talking about labor and delivery because they do it too all you carens out there who have your panties in a bunch about the fact that doctors are starting to use the term pregnant person instead of pregnant women i want you to listen up women are people non-binary people and trans men are also people so this term includes everyone that was born with a uterus and could be pregnant okay so first and foremost if your doctor looks like that and if your doctor tells you that you need a new doctor right your doctor did not pass basic biology and you should maybe not be allowing that person to do anything uh with your body at all i would not trust that doctor secondly my child is not allowed to have tick-tock well it's a chinese asset for one thing you know this is like what i expect to see if i was walking through a psychiatric facility sincerely these people are memes they are literally memes they are the things that dc drano posts on his account and says this is what the left represents it's like but these are actual people actual people are out there with these ideas it blows my mind that that's that these are real people i mean it's important to to realize because those kids especially the younger people you know i have no truck with the adults you should never be you know practicing medicine if you believe that men can get pregnant right but the children who are saying this stuff to me those are victims you want to talk about like victimhood right those are the people that you know when you talk about the the elite which practically now exists to scoop people's brains out with a melon baller i mean it chases people around essentially and and destroys their brains like this is the result of it and and their unhappiness is on the hands of the people who preach this garbage who go into the schools and tell them this right and the terrible terrible ways that they suffer and they do i mean it's orwellian the way that they suffer this is all on them i mean we cannot let this go right it is it's corroding the values of society and there's something i've noticed about social media every time and it is interesting and i think it's very relevant that this is chinese social media this is this is a chinese asset because what better way to quickly control culture than via social media app and every time we've introduced a new app people have gotten more and more insane right so there was like facebook and twitter that was like when i was in high school and okay cool we're connecting with each other and that seems okay and then you get instagram and suddenly it's all about people being naked and you know making it less than less clothes less clothes for likes you know it's all about getting the like and now you have tick tock and it's just it's become just pure freakazoids you know what i mean like just like the freaks are out and they don't care and they're unapologetic if you have a problem with this because you're a bigot and unfortunately younger and younger generations that are on these social media apps again this started when i was in high school with facebook now you've got people they're four-year-olds are on tick-tock and parents are not aware that this is what they're seeing one thing that's really important i'll just say this real quick brian one thing like when watching some of these videos you can see on the side i don't know if you guys know tick tock but there will be a thing that shows the comments and so many of these people who make these horrible leftist tick tocks they turn the comments off because the left doesn't debate the left doesn't debate these ideas so they turn the comments off so that conservatives and people with different ideas can come on and correct them on these things i i'm on tick tock okay sorry oh my gosh what is a man in our minds but i mean i have all my comments on all my social media any anyone can come on and debate me no matter what they want to do that's fine i accept the debate but the left they don't debate like that they turn their comments off so that their ideas can just spread and no one has a chance to have any sort of rebuttal i would love to see what the average age is of people that are now starting to get tick tocks i just know i've seen so many videos of children dancing and i just don't understand how it's possible for parents to be able to manage that content you know what i mean yeah that's what that's why we need parents to be parents stand up to your children you don't get tick-tock you don't get under social media if i catch it i'm breaking your phone", "1ryNts5XdUs": "all right matt without giving us any spoilers did you ever get your answer to the question i mean we've got supreme court justices that cannot answer this question what is a woman it's a big it's a big question now well i mean i did get we got an answer in the end yeah we got a lot of different answers but we did get a correct answer at the very end i won't say anything else because it's a big spoiler okay did you ever in your life think that you would have to make a documentary to answer a question that once upon a time was so basic when i see once upon a time talking five or six years ago i may be a little bit further but when i was coming up in school this was not a big question a difficult question to answer now you're walking up to women you're asking him the question and they're completely stumped by this this inquisition yeah i mean i think uh 10 years ago if you told me i would have been i would have been pretty floored that this is a conversation although one thing we get into in the film and there's so many there's so many aspects to gender ideology that it's like 90 minutes can't even begin to cover it so there are all these different avenues that uh i hope other people make movies to follow so for example we spend a brief amount of time getting into the history of where this stuff came from where gender ideology came from and uh it goes back i mean arguably it goes back you know into the 19th century but certainly it goes back to the mid-20th century with two guys we talk about john money and alfred kinsey and that's that's where the seed was planted so although 10 years ago if i had known that what is a woman would be a controversial question i would have been surprised by that um that's only because i and most other people weren't aware of what was already happening and kind of bubbling under the surface and making its way through our institutions especially academia and that had been going on for decades before what's really interesting is that i graduated high school with not a single transgendered individual and now that being trans is it's like you know the new black they still aren't trans right they're just some people are lesbian some people were gay now it is you go into a classroom and there's five or six people that identify as transgendered how is that happening how is it possible that all of these generations prior we understood by the way i learned in psychology class what gender dysphoria was this used to be considered a mental illness like bipolarism like anorexia i talked extensively in my book about my chapter on anorexia thank goodness nobody was like well you're allowed to just be anorexic and we're gonna give you gastric bypass surgery even though you're a hundred pounds how did we get here i think every family has somewhere tucked away an old shoebox of old photos and maybe some videos and camcorders of their family the solution is legacy box it's the simplest and safest way to digitally preserve all of your aging video tapes camcorder tapes film reels and pictures so that they are preserved forever i mean imagine the relief knowing that all those cherished memories like christmas mornings and your baby's first steps are safe from fires and water damage and preserved for years to come i received my legacy box and it was so easy to use i threw everything in there all the memories of my sisters my grandparents and i shipped it off the legacy box father's day event is happening right now go to legacybox.com candace to save 50 legacy box is great for your family or as a gift for dad that's legacybox.com candace 50 off legacybox.com candace if you look at the numbers the latest gallup poll they had i think it's something like 20 percent of gen z identifies as lgbt um and a significant portion identify as trans if you trace it back to the generations what you find actually is that starting with like our grandparents generation starting there and then going up lgbt identification has exactly doubled generation over generation over generation and this obviously is not something that's just happening naturally this is uh this is all by design and i think with trans in particular uh we talk about in the film the kind of social contagion um aspect of this where the these ideas are i mean they're all over hollywood and media especially social media which is where kids spend all of their time anyway so they're in school and this is part of the peer culture in school is the gender fluidity and then they go home and but they're they don't they never leave the peer culture so then they go home and they're still on their phones all the time so they just never escaped this world and it's beat into their heads uh and i think part of what's happening is that when you mention anorexia you know other things that people have struggled with in the past um you know girls in particular have been susceptible to eating disorders and uh other struggles like that and i i think so what that tells us is that especially when you're a young person and especially a girl but this applies boys to there are struggles that are kind of just a part of growing up uh feeling especially going through puberty you feel kind of alien in your own body you know the changes are happening hormonally physically that feel strange and um and that's always a struggle that's it's normal now society comes along and gives the girls in particular a framework for understanding their discomfort where they say oh well if you feel that way it means you're actually a boy right whereas in the past we would have said to them oh this is a phase you'll you'll you know you'll grow at it you'll get passive it passed it we don't say that anymore now we take this thing which is a phase and we turn it into a an identity right and and that's what's so bizarre because i can't imagine like when i was going with anorexia having a society that would stand up and be like no yes you are fat like you're you're a hundred pounds but you are very fat and you should get gastric bypass surgery and yet we have this confirmation that's taking place and i don't really understand how they're able to delineate right so now when we start seeing these stories of people that are trans species well i don't have a problem with trans species if you're telling me that transgenderism is real like if a person can wake up and say i'm a boy i actually was born a girl but actually today i'm a boy how are you able to say to an individual that thinks that they're a snake hey actually no you're not a snake you're a human being like i don't understand when you're speaking to these professionals in their field how they're able to delineate and before you answer that question i actually want to show a clip of a wolf person that you met because i think that i met a wolf yeah why not so now we are seeing kids that are identifying as animals going to school and they are purring instead of answering questions and they meow and the teachers are not allowed to question it because it's considered a queer identity so you have kids are going to school and they're saying i'm a cat and the teachers have to affirm them as a cat yes so it's not just literal zoos now basically they are i am a 27 year old transgender woman i am a wolf therian and a member of the furry fandom when and how did you discover this inner wolf-ness um probably around age 10 or 11. i was watching an anime about wolves and see the wolf running across the screen and i'm somehow just intrinsically like oh that's me have you spent any time around biological wolves yes that sounds dangerous also what context are you so i was a volunteer with the preserve and i've also visited many wolf preserves are you able to communicate with the wolves am i gonna have a conversation with a wolf in the way that i'm communicating you and i obviously not am i going to read their body language respond appropriately to their behaviors and their nonverbal cues yes would you would you be able to give us an example of this wolf communication um no i'm not comfortable doing so okay all right so i watch that and i'm observing a mentally sick individual and what i like is that uh he is speaking to you like you're the mentally ill one he's like well obviously not when i communicate to the wolves it's not in the normal way that you and i communicate matt like just be an idiot matt um what are you what's going through your head because do you have this remarkable ability to keep a very straight face and to listen and to try to accept the information that they are giving you yeah i think what that was the idea in the film was as much as i particularly with some of the you know we talked to a gender for quote unquote gender firming pediatrician who drugs kids and those sorts of people in particular i i very much wanted to just yell at her and and get into an argument but um we thought it'd be much more effective to let them talk and just ask questions let uh let gender ideology sort of hang itself and um so that was that's the strategy and that in every other interview just kind of like what we found is that questions basic questions are a powerful tool but also silence like because what what they want to do is um they want to give you their talking point which is like a sentence long and then move on to the next question then just leave it at that so if you just remain silent let them keep no let's hear more about that and then you find that there's no that's all they got they don't have whatever your question is they have a sentence they have their party line they have nothing beyond that um and then so that's when things begin to you know quickly break down for them right and they get they get upset they suddenly start getting very uncomfortable even though you're being calm and you're being very kind to them you can see that he's not he suddenly gets very uncomfortable and what's interesting to me which strikes me about that conversation is him saying i got this idea when i was 11 and i was watching anime right like okay so you were a child and you were a fantastical child as all children are children are fantastical they can make up things in their head they're wildly imaginative and you just saw a wolf on tv and decided i'm a wolf too right when did we start pretending that every thought that a child has is legitimate and why are we pretending that every thought that a child has is legitimate well i think the why of that it goes all the way down to what gender ideology is which is an assault on truth um and that's why so many of the interviews i had with people always came back to as i was talking a punches pilot every time it always came back to what is truth whose truth are we talking about uh because that's really what this comes down to this is real this is the project of relativism you know the world is relative to your own desires you can create your own universe in reality for yourself and obviously when you when you establish that then of course you're gonna have people that identify as animals that's you know five six seven years ago when the right was saying oh soon we're gonna have people identifying as animals in the left side that's ridiculous but all that this is always the the way it works right where the right has the slippery slope argument the left side that'll never happen and then five years later it's happening um but of course it's to happen because especially with kids as you as you said i mean if you tell kids that they can be anything they want to be and it's all about their own perception then a lot of them are going to identify as animals because that's that's fun i mean they're going to die because like you know i've babysat kids i think their mermaids don't want to get out of the water they want to be superman and jump off of buildings a lot of kids are going to die if we pretend there's no such thing as reality they're going to they're going to die from that and they're also going to die from um from a life of you know trying to live in despair rejecting your true self and that's what leads to you know the enormous amount of suicides you see among trans people and everything else and this this is not because of of bullying or anything that they that they claim it's because when you when someone is trying to live in a way that rejects their natural identity um that's that's a life of despair you know i spoke to um a man who transitioned to a woman and then transitioned back and does a lot of work in the space and he actually clarified for me that actually suicide rates go up after they transition they don't go down so this idea that it's because they're not being accepted or they're not being able to transition and that's what's making them suicidal isn't right at all it's actually once they go through with these life-changing surgery you know you chop your penis off you turn your colon into a vagina then you kind of get into this place of depression and realizing that your entire life has been a lie and that a cosmetic procedure didn't help to fix that and in many ways made things worse thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the

did you and George get married after getting engaged and what was the planning process like um okay so George and I my husband uh we met and then we got engaged two weeks later after first looking eyes on each other so I don't think anybody will ever beat our record um I mean unless they are just their parents pick the wedding and that's it but a very unusual story it truly was a love at first sight story um and we got engaged nine months later so it happened very quickly in terms of planning the wedding it was so fun I mean we just I was a very relaxed bride I mean I mean the world is crazy every single day so the idea that I was going to be stressed out about napkin colors it's just it wasn't going to be me so I'm definitely I definitely wasn't the bridezilla and I think the best advice that I would give people because I've been in weddings where uh the wife truly loses their mind I don't know what they think this day truly amounts to other than being in love with somebody and making a decision before God to spend the rest of your life with them a pledge and a vow before God to spend the rest of your life with them and supporting them and if you remember that and you remain Tethered to that I remember that people that are there are there to celebrate you um I think you you always have a special day so everything went perfectly at our wedding because we were relaxed and there was no way for it not to go perfectly unless I didn't end up with my husband he ended up with me so 10 out of 10 would recommend I honestly am so sad that I can only marry him one time I want to marry him twice three four times five times six times many kids ten start with ten thanks for joining me on this episode of Candace if you like this video subscribe to this YouTube channel and ring

nurse who was there she was actually so sweet and kind of finds the situation to be a bit ridiculous she knows that we're healthy and we want to leave and she said we just need you to sign these forms

that she works in the hospital but she represents social services and i kid you not she was wearing a badge that said i am caffeinated vaccinated and activated somebody get me out of this nightmare

monitoring you for 48 hours we said great where do we sign", "y61i_u4ajaY": "let's start with the first story of the week that i want to cover and it pertains to culture it's amber heard the actress right now you're watching a public trial between her and her ex-husband johnny depp this case has seized not just america has seized the entire world and it is something that every single person should be paying attention to first and foremost i want to take you through a timeline in case you have not been following this case of what has happened between herd and death so they were married for a very short time in 2016 heard filed for divorce after 15 months of marriage she obtained a temporary restraining order against depp claiming that he abused her while under the influence of drugs and alcohol johnny depp denied the allegations and a 7 million settlement was reached out of court between the two parties now first i want to say something very clearly the public at that moment had decided that amber heard was telling the truth amber heard came out she had pictures of what appeared to be a bruise and at that time don't forget me too was going on they just made her a hero she was walking the red carpets every me too hashtag believe women time's up movement wanted amber heard at their events they just said oh gosh so brave she's spoken out against the abuse the victims the abusive nature that so many women have to go through and suffer she's so brave and she got a seven million dollar settlement and she said you know what i'm gonna donate all of the proceeds from the settlement to help other women um that are in domestically abusive relationships except that never happened by the way which we'll get to then in 2018 despite signing that settlement in agreement with johnny depp and despite the press very much being on her side we know that victimhood is addicting she's loved the attention she got from it so she made a decision very bad decision to pen an op-ed for the washington post in december of 2018 about the treatment of women in domestic abuse cases she did not mention depp by name but everyone knew she was talking about johnny depp because what other male figure was she married to days later as a consequence disney dropped johnny depp from the sixth installment of pirates of the caribbean based on an article not based on facts he was not guilty but disney determined that he was guilty now we all know how much johnny depp has contributed to the pirates of the caribbean franchise i mean he he's worked so hard to make those movies successful and just like that because of hashtag me too he was done and so in 2019 depp sued herd for 50 million dollars for defamation over her washington post piece and he claimed that it cost him obviously lucrative acting work she attempted to get that lawsuit dismissed and the judge decided no let's actually hear that case and that's what we're seeing today the case between the two of these parties is ongoing we'll be right back to the show in just a moment but first we have to talk about the economy and the dire straits that our economy is in and i know it's depressing we're already starting to see those ripple effects in the housing market as buying power has diminished have you considered what could happen in the stock market if our economy simply stalls out well don't wait for that to

elements of this case in case you haven't been following it i have to the best of my ability i've watched as much of it as possible and what's become abundantly clear is that the public has now completely flipped on amber heard because it turns out that when you actually look at evidence and you don't just hashtag believe women but you try to hashtag believe facts you might find out that the person that you've been celebrating the person that you've been applauding the person that you've been feeling bad for is actually the aggressor so let's start there let's take a look and listen to amber heard giving the performance of her life in court because to be honest she's she's not that great in her movies but she does give this her all take a look no i didn't want to leave him i didn't want this to be the reality i didn't want to have the man i was in love with i know you don't come back from that you know not dumb i i know you can't hit a woman i you can't hit a man you can't hit anyone you can't just hit somebody because they i knew there was no i knew it was wrong and i knew that i had to leave him and that's what broke my heart because i didn't want to leave him i thought if i got up out of that room and i would leave the best thing that ever happened to me and i wish i could sit here and say i stood up and i walked out of that house and i drew a line and i stood up for myself [Music] it's just looking at the dirty carpet trying to will myself to get up oh come on who doesn't believe that heavy breathing a lot of head shaking no tears very gone with the wind style the dirty carpet i mean the dirty carpet that's in her head how could you not believe that well let's go back and actually listen to a clip of amber heard while she was married to johnny depp you're going to get a different version of her take a listen but i was hitting you it was not punching you babe you're not punched don't tell me what it feels like to be punched you know you've been a lot of fights been around a lot one time yeah you didn't get punched you got hit i'm sorry i hit you like this but i did not punch you i did not deck you i was hitting you i don't know what the motion of my actual hand was but you're fine i did not hurt you i did not punch you i was hitting you how are you how what am i supposed to do do this i'm not sitting here bitching about it am i you are that's the difference between me and you your baby because you started you are yes you did so you did the right thing the big thing the you know what you are admirable this is like instagram versus real life you know what i mean instagram so sad real life you're a big baby i wasn't hitting you up i mean i don't i don't know what my hand was doing was i assaulting yes maybe i don't know what my hand was doing and then using that mechanism that women use so you're not a man right her idea here is man up johnny man up so what if i hit you what are you gonna do she actually says that by the way in a later conversation the press isn't going to believe you what are you going to go out and say that you were abused johnny manipulative she's so calculating right and this is what the public has been able to see that johnny depp was maybe in fact actually the victim all along as he stipulates that she was violent actually uh the psychologist who testified diagnosed her with histrionic personality disorder she has a way of turning everything sort of into a movie in her own head hence the the dirty carpet that she's talking about is on the dirty carpet no tears no tears but you should just believe her because she's a woman right wrong i never followed this movement the metoo movement it's it's so fraudulent to say that because of somebody's sex you should just blankets believe them it's absolute foolishness every piece of this trial is foolishness it just defies common sense in fact i would say this is my favorite part i picked up on this i don't think the press really did the absurdity of her detailing all of these violent acts that johnny did when he's was perpetually on drugs or i should say allegedly on drugs she tells these stories and they don't exactly add up here she is describing johnny depp on the drug mdma two different incidences here you go take a listen he pulls out a bag of mdma i asked him what it was and he told me it was mdma he shoves me up against the fridge he asked me by the throat and he just was holding me there by my throat and i wondered if the if it was the drugs i wondered if it was him he took the um a handful of pills and i didn't count how many but when i came back downstairs i did the math on the amount that was left and i think it was either eight or ten i can't recall as i sit here now either eight or ten pills of mdma i took a capsule um it's like a powder in a capsule i took a capsule and johnny took several i didn't count but um you know it's very different when you see someone take one versus a handful of something but flight attendant got friendly with me but just friendly just like mdma friendly johnny uh grabs grabs her hand and tells her not to touch me and she kind of reacts in a way like you know like defending herself and was trying to clear clarify and um grabbed her by the wrist and slammed it down on the table and told her he could break her wrist amber amber amber amber let me stop you right there do you mean to tell me that he ingested an entire fistful of mdma known as the love drug and then he started he started hitting he started being angry and threatening to break someone's wrist hmm that's an interesting mdma trip let's uh let's keep going here the hotel room um johnny's accusing me of effectively having um eng engaged that uh caused that at one point johnny just shoves me like i mean just shoves shoves me hard i fall back onto this glass table um i catch myself on the table um i don't know how some furniture got knocked around there was a you know i i'm trying to stand up for myself i'm trying to stand up literally i'm not you know at this point i don't even try to hit back or try to run at some point uh johnny whacks me in the face amber amber johnny depp might be the only person in the history of the world who has ingested mdma and flown into a violent rage and turned down a threesome with a flight attendant i don't know maybe i just something is not adding up i'm not saying i'm next running mdma but i am saying that if you ask the experts they would say that that just doesn't happen when people consume what is known colloquially as the love drug so it turns out that women can in fact be toxic liars which is kind of common sense but it's taken the world quite some time to wake up to it so we're going to keep following this story and keep you

victimhood I think it's great I love her I think her podcast where she talks about how she's a victim every day is amazing and I think it's amazing now that she's even winning awards for being a victim I think that's what's what we need more of in society more victimhood and tears and even if you're a princess and you're dripping in Saudi Arabian diamonds on your wedding day you too can be a victim and that is what I have learned from Meghan Markle well now Prince Harry Meghan Markle are going to receive a prestigious human rights award for calling out the structural racism within the Royal household now you're wondering what structure of racism that was basically Megan restructured racism to be anytime she didn't get what she wanted it was racism so like right now by Meghan Markle and I'm like hey I want a hundred thousand dollar raise daily wire and they're like hey no I just go racism that was structural racism I'd say liar because I was told no and so that's why I learned Meghan Markle and that's why I'm really happy be that she is receiving this award it's the Robert F Kennedy human rights award because of her courage to stand up within their Royal Institution and call out that racism Carrie Kennedy is the president of Robert F Kennedy's human rights Center a non-profit that gives out an array of awards to individuals for their transformative work in the pursuit of a more just and peaceful world blah blah blah everything's kindergarten how are you feeling are you happy here's an award here's my registration trophy we don't know what you've done Harry and Megan at all in this world except show us how you can make millions of dollars talking trash about your family non-stop but we'd now like to award you for doing absolutely nothing and we know that they'll be there because there isn't a red carpet event that Meghan Markle would ever miss that girl loves a camera the problem of course is that she's a d-list actress and no one's buying her stick anymore and Harry looks pretty pathetic constantly talking trash about his own family so we always wonder how long they can keep up the charade and I'm always proven that they can just keep on keeping on love my girl Meghan Markle alright guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde's breakup whose

transgender debate is being waged all around the country and the world left versus right conservative versus liberal school systems versus the parents the fog of this ideological war has never been thicker but occasionally occasionally a ray of sunshine breaks through a moment of inexorable truth that acts as a disinfectant to the pollution of lies a moment that we can't unsee or in this case on reed that happened when a mother in her desperation posted to strangers on reddit seeking help her post recently went viral for those of you that don't know reddit is an anonymous online forum that people often turn to to seek advice from strangers regarding topics that may be too embarrassing to consult their friends and families regarding and so a mother posted regarding her son who she believes is her daughter because he has begun transitioning i'm going to read that post verbatim because i think it's really important ready post reads i have no clue what to do daughter can't get the bottom surgery and is becoming suicidal hello i have always been in support of my transgender daughter when she was still a boy and started expressing a want to be a girl i did everything right therapists then puberty blockers everything now she is 20 and everything is falling apart we had to hold off on the body surgery because of costs but now finally had enough and went and got several consults all have said the same thing the puberty blockers have left her with a micro penis she has to get part of her vagina made with her colon well one of her friends had that surgery and even years later it smells fairly colon-like obviously my daughter is now distraught she's in counseling but is becoming worse and worse in her mental state and i am frantic on top of this she has never had any sexual function no urges no erections even when she tried masturbation to see if she could simulate herself nothing the doctors say this may not change even after the surgery her dating life is dismal as well we knew it would be hard but it's impossible the one man who was with her for a while soon just became frustrated by her lack of sexual anything and broke it off i don't know what to do a friend suggested i post here for advice please help me help my child okay i mean that is very very very sad to read and typically we wait until the end of the show to answer questions from back at home but today i'm going to answer this question this woman's plea in front of the entire world so dear anonymous mother there is no other way for me to respond to you other than honestly and openly in the hopes that other children other mothers will be spared the tragedy that is happening in your household the truth is that you have mutilated your once perfectly healthy growing son over a feeling that he had ultimately it is you alone that is responsible for this mutilation because you prioritize acquiescing to an insane cultural narrative rather than recognizing basic immutable biological facts once upon a time your son now an adult man used to be an imaginative little boy children believe in all sorts of things i would imagine when they're growing up sometimes those things are harmless like santa claus and the easter bunny and so we as adults play into their magical minds harmless make-believe ideas are what childhoods are all about but knowing the difference between what is harmless and what is harmful is our responsibility for example it's okay for a child to believe he is superman but it is not okay for him to believe truly that he can fly because human beings cannot fly and a child looking to don a cape and leap from a bedroom window can seriously harm themselves or worse kill themselves they may not understand this as we pull them away from the window they may even scream and kick and cry because it's who they believe they are who they want to be but our primary responsibility as parents is to at first keep them alive with truth showing them right from wrong it's why there are parental cliches like you'll understand when you're older because they will we will get back to the show in just a moment but first let's talk about your internet security using the internet without expressvpn is like leaving your laptop exposed at a coffee shop table while you run to the counter to buy another drink most of the time you'll probably be okay but what if one day you come back and your laptop is gone a lot hunter biden every time you connect to an unencrypted network think cafe airport or hotel wi-fi your online data is not secured any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data and it doesn't take an advanced techy knowledge to hack someone a 12 year old could do it that's why i recommend that you use expressvpn expressvpn creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so that hackers can't steal your sensitive data what i like most about expressvpn is how easy it is to use simply download the app on your phone or computer tap one button and that's it you're protected secure your online data today with the vpn that i trust by visiting expressvpn.com candice that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com candace you can get an extra three months free so your child came to you and he said i want to be a girl mommy and rather than explaining to him why ultimately that is not a biological possibility no more than flying like a bird is you went along with the delusion you essentially allowed your child to jump from the figurative bedroom window and now your once upon a time child is now a man who is crashing into the earth's surface all at once the worst possible manner of learning that gravity exists he's already harmed himself and now you're wondering if he's going to take it a step further and kill himself because there's no way to undo what's been done reality has caught up with fiction truth has caught up with the lie his depression is stemming from the fact that he realizes he will never be a woman sure they can use parts of his colon to give him something that maybe resembles a vagina and smells like a rectum but he will never be a woman and he knows that deep down so do you mom and his suicidal thoughts are stemming from the realization that he can never really have the opportunity to be a man now either because his mother allowed his sexual parts to be mutilated because he can't feel anything he'll never know what physical desire for the rest of his life he'll never know what that means he'll never have a normal relationship and that was a decision that was made for him in his childhood yes alongside a host of predatory doctors and therapists who should all be imprisoned by the way you agree to the bodily mutilation of your son and so my heart aches for him because he is a true victim he was a child victim a young man whose life was stolen from him how does it get better well it starts with your own reckoning mom you're mentally unstable and you have harmed your son irrevocably and yet you are still holding on to the belief that you have a daughter and that you have done as you said quote everything right but in fact the exact opposite is true you have a son and you have done everything wrong you both need help separately and it begins with acknowledging the truth the truth is that transitioning despite its cultural popularity is not a solution to anything that's why suicide and depression rates go up for individuals after they complete the process not before not during but after because they meet gravity and the weight of realizing that they can never truly and fully go back is paralyzing fortunately there are groups dedicated to helping these individuals groups like sex change regret an established charity run by formerly trans individuals helping people like your son so it's not hopeless your son needs to hear that and he needs to know that it is not hopeless there are people out there who are similarly victimized just like him and who are ready and willing to help your son needs to know that while there is no way back there is fortunately a way forward and it begins with recognizing truth

of course she I almost feel like she's the new cardi B it's the person that the media has decided should be glorified no matter what in fact this past week they are hitting Kanye over suggesting that clinical obesity is not something that should be promoted and understanding that clinical obesity instead is something that we should be discussing and trying to fix so Twitter has run a banner that has been for the last I don't know three days saying that lizzo hits back at you know Kanye West by essentially just saying that she likes being fat and they're making this seem like this is the right way to hit back no we should discuss political obesity and we should discuss it with a sober analysis so lizzo did this Vanity Fair cover story she was a Vanity Fair cover story and here are a few of her quotes on Race she said quote the way black women have been treated in this country has made me feel very hopeless I don't think there was a time when we were treated fairly and with respect if I see hope in this country it will come from the accountability of the people who have the privilege as a fat black woman this country has ever gone forward it's stayed pretty much the same for me okay so I do want to just ask the question to lizzo what's it going to take for you to feel like you're privileged like I actually want someone to tell me this like when will lizzo get on stage and say I have a remarkable amount of privilege I am a multi-millionaire I'm giving awards I am doing deals with Netflix I am doing deals with instacart I am being handed questionable trophies for the work that I am doing I am now on the cover of Vanity Fair one of the biggest magazines fashion magazines in the world and I am essentially being glorified for things that I actually should make a committed effort to better in my life like my clinical obesity but despite all of this they're telling me that it's great it's amazing and I'm being defended by everybody but it's not it's not a privilege because I'm black so I'm just wondering what does it take for society to admit that any black person has privilege any black person give me Malia and Sasha Obama I I'm sure that despite their perfectly cushioned life despite their multi-million dollar homes despite their Martha Vineyard Mansion despite being able to have a party for their dad while everybody else was locked down in covet in Martha's Vineyard and massless we're having a good time because my dad was a former president I'm sure they could still get on stage and they could still do an interview and say that it's just hard for black people and that they still feel that pain so I am wondering I'm posing a question to the world give me a list give me the comment that I can read out loud that says this is what it is going to take for us to admit that a black person in society has privilege because to me lizzo is now a stunning example of privilege but she's black so we're not allowed to say that no matter what you are still allowed to be a victim and she is speaking out by the way about this idea that when she performs there's a lot of white people in the crowd she doesn't like that she has said quote I am not making music for white people I am a black woman I am making music from my black experience for me to heal myself from the experience that we call life end quote oh okay well I'm gonna have to say hashtag White lives matter to that I don't know why we say these things what is I am not making music for white people mean could could a white artist could Taylor Swift could have been interviewing say I am not making music for black people I am making music from my white experience for me to heal myself from the experience that we call Life Could Taylor Swift say that question again just wondering I have no answers here I'm just wondering if there would that would be totally fine fine and if it is fine then okay I'm okay with this interview then we have achieved equality we've achieved a quality of Taylor Swift can say that she doesn't make music for black people if it's only fine when lizzo says it then no we haven't achieved equality we have just recreated a form of racism that we feel is permissible in society moving on to more black suffering no matter what um I don't even really know how to tell you about this because it seems like it's fiction but New York City May in fact need Batman or Spider-Man somebody that can beat up the Green Goblin gang because there is a Green Goblin gang and if you have no idea what I'm talking about a bunch of black women that were dressed in neon green part of a gang jumped on to the subway and began to Pummel two 19 year old women at a Time Square subway train stop and they were released without bail on Tuesday but I want to actually have you guys take a look at this video take a listen to this video because it's insane to take a listen now my producer as we were watching this video it looks like there's about eight uh younger black women that are just beating up people that are dressed in these neon green nylon outfits covering their faces but with holes cut out for their ponytails which is even like just more weird I don't know it just this is a very bizarre video and I don't mean to laugh at these victims but when my producer saw this video she said who is the person recording this right like how could you just allow this to happen and I said in defense of the person recording it I wouldn't know what to make of it I don't think that my brain would be able to process that I was witnessing a crime I don't know what I would think if a bunch of people that were dressed in neon green from head to toe but with spaces cut out for their ponytails jumped onto a plane and started screaming and shouting and cursing I would I would I would maybe think that I was watching the Jabbawockeez like they were maybe going to break out into a dance or that I was being a part of something I was being entertained or maybe it was an experiment and this was some sort of art experiment I definitely would not have thoughts that people were being harmed or mugged instantly your brain just can't process something this bizarre but yes this is this is what has happened in New York City who has been lacks New York City which has been lacks on crime for a very long time now you are having people that are indulging in Fantastical crime is what I see this as honestly this is a Batman plot line so the woman that was arrested her name is Miriam esoph they caught one of them she was 26 and she was cut loose on supervised release after being arraigned on a second degree robbery charge in the October 2nd video that I just played for you one day after she turned herself into the cops with her defense attorney at her side so she actually turned herself in and hopefully they will get the rest of these young women and hopefully Batman and Robin and Superman and Spider-Man will Assemble and save the people in these liberal hellhole cities thank you for joining me today come back tomorrow for an all new episode where I will be telling you some behind the scenes uh circumstances that took place at the premiere which is happening tonight and I know that you are going to be watching it live with me 8 P.M Eastern [Music]", "WPuIMNFpkl8": "we no longer have a gentleman culture if you will I was thinking about this topic more and talking about with my husband of how much we have deviated away from gentleman culture think about a Time in America where we used to have duels where people would take it sounds ridiculous now but people would take couple of steps count their steps turn around and challenge each other to a duel whoever could fire first you think about that now and you think wow that those people must have been so honest that they took exactly the amount of steps and turned around nobody cheated and turned around and shot the other person because people had more Integrity back in the day and now today it seems at least obviously I don't know but you should go watch the clip of her with this ring and putting her hand down and go look at that story of that kid who is uh somehow beating every chess player that's ever played the game and it does seem that it's because we don't have the same values anymore", "67k-yWw8NIQ": "i do want to get into talking about these cosmetic procedures because you sat down with the surgeon and you discussed vaginoplasty vaginoplasty i might be saying that wrong on a 16 year old so i want to illuminate that for audiences and have them take a listen to the conversation what's the youngest patient that you've operated on the youngest patient i've done vaginoplasty on um is age 16. do you worry that miners just don't understand enough about themselves they're not neurologically developed enough yet to make permanent life altering decisions absolutely not i want to punch her in the face you did not punch her in the face i don't know how given that you have four children um when i what i hear when i listen to that is i mutilated the young child's body that procedure of people that don't know they're taking a piece of your colon and they're putting it in the front so that it looks like keyword the keywords here looks like it's a cosmetic procedure um a vagina how do you feel sitting across and hearing that that oh yeah i mutilated a child yeah that was uh that was that was probably the the hardest interview we did in certain ways and we right with our you know the team after we left that one we were just kind of like sitting there in silence and just kind of trying to absorb because you're really looking you're kind of sitting there staring into pure evil i think as you point out i i totally agree with that and what we have to realize by the way is that um this is actually very common uh especially with girls the the you know so-called sex change surgery top surgery chopping the breasts off of of girls is uh increasingly common and uh they're doing it in california now down to the age i believe the age of 13 is when they start with uh with girls um and that's why it doesn't i actually the the fact that you just cited that suicidality goes is the highest after surgery that makes sense to me intuitively i hadn't seen that study but we were told that by someone in the in the film also which makes a lot of sense because you know the underlying mental problem is still there after surgery but now you've added on this extra level of you've mutilated your body and there's going to be regret and everything that comes with that so it makes a lot of sense that that would be the case yeah it's it's very scary and i love that in this documentary you actually went to africa because my husband all the time we talk about various social issues he spends a lot of time in africa because he hunts and in the bush and he always says to me when you get to africa and you start talking to these locals they don't even understand the concept of gay and i have this idea that we actually have become so progressive we've become regressive in society like we've just gone like forward forward forward and actually now we're like behind backward um it's the reason why we're acting like medieval creatures wearing you know masks as if we're like hanging garlic and warding off vampires right like these things don't make any sense medically um and it's sort of the same way when you look at this transgender where they can't even grasp the concept of what you're saying they're laughing at you like you're a crazy person like you're somebody who's arrived from a medieval period donut doesn't understand basic facts and how things work that has gotta it's stunning to you went to a tribe and we're supposed to believe that they're backwards right they don't know anything we're living in this forward futuristic society and they're basically laughing as you're trying to explain to them um what transgenderism even is yeah that's part of the reason well i'll admit that one of the reasons we went there was to troll the libs you know uh because it's just uh it's very funny to go and have african tribesmen saying these things because the left can't what are they going to do it's like it's racist to criticize so that was part of it but also but but i think more so it was um it was to test this ridiculous idea from the left that they claim they say that the so-called gender binary is a western colonial construct and you know the idea that men are men and women are women that's that's that's our unique western thing and you go outside of that bubble you're going to find that people are very fluid and open and progressive and then of course that's not the case but we said let's go and test it out anyway and we found the exact opposite is the case that actually gender ideology is a very insular uniquely western modern thing doesn't exist outside the bubble and it's very revealing when as it happened to me because i'm asking these questions and they assume because i'm asking that i'm actually confused and they think that i'm just an absolute maniac they were nice about it i mean they pitied me like a child but they were they were nice about it but now they put me in the position of having to like they were demanding explanations for me how all this works and so now i'm trying to explain it to them and i think nothing reveals the absurdity of an idea more than trying to explain it to someone who has no shared frame of reference to you like you're starting from the from ground up trying to explain this concept and uh it quickly becomes obvious how vacuous the idea is when did we decide to stop upholding free speech as a basic right was playing out right now at big tech companies and social media sites that's a very dangerous precedent look it doesn't matter what your politics are who you voted for everyone should have the right to express themselves freely sadly the big tech monopoly has instead opted for silencing tactics and censorship to fight back against big tech's control of the internet i use expressvpn ever wondered how free to access tech giants make all of their money well by tracking your searches video history and everything that you click on then they build a profile on you and then sell off your sensitive data when you use expressvpn as an app on your computer or your phone you anonymize much of your online presence by hiding your ip address that makes your activity more difficult to trace and sell to advertisers what's more expressvpn encrypts 100 of your network data to protect you from eavesdroppers and cybercriminals what i like most is how easy it is to use just takes one click to protect all of your devices that's why expressvpn is rated number one by business insider so let's stop allowing big tech to revoke our rights to free speech why not revoke their right to your data instead secure your internet

learn more somewhere in kenya people are just talking behind your back being like we've got the craziest freaking person from the west you're not even going to believe what this idiot said uh and i think it's such a brilliant thing to do because it really showcases just how stupid we've gotten in america none of it makes any sense and everybody knows it it's basic instinct to know that none of this makes any sense and it's extremely foolish i do want to get to um the person that you identified as the hero of the film um so i guess let's actually just watch a clip of scott nugent every child that they convince is is transgender and in need of medical transition it generates 1.3 million dollars to pharma and we're believing a pharmaceutical company lupron hormone blockers reversible so they say well the truth is is that in 2003 lupron was sued and deemed a criminal enterprise by the u.s government they paid the most fine of any pharmaceutical company at that time 874 million dollars wrote a check is lupron chemical castration yes we're giving it to pedophiles aren't we we're getting people that are dying and we're giving it to kids telling them that they were born in the wrong body and it's completely safe stunning yeah that's uh scott nugent so that's a female who transitioned to man and in fact she says uh one of the only honest people we talked to she says that i transitioned to appear like a man but i'll never be a man that was her her words um and now having gone through the procedure as an adult um and so many horrific complications from it and she says that this is these are experimental procedures that we're doing to people including kids and there's really there's an interesting dynamic between like we talk to the so-called experts who are proponents of gender ideology and they're so evasive and they won't answer any questions and they run out of the room then you talk to the opponents of gender ideology people like scott nugent and incredibly open willing to talk about anything and i think when you have an issue and one side doesn't want to talk about it the other side is willing to talk about it almost already like you don't even need to know anything else you already know who's probably on the right side of it absolutely because they're they're playing in fiction and these people are now dealing in facts you know having your entire life ruined and people do not understand um all the medical issues that come from this and like it was that one stunning reddit post i think you covered it on your show as well where this woman was just so shocked that her 20 year old who had been on hormones and um had gone through all these various cosmetic procedures was now depressed didn't want to come out of their room and said my child doesn't even have sexual urgings like 20 20 year olds and suicidal yeah because they were 13 you started you blocked them from going through puberty my child now has a micro penis which they don't tell you about right you there is no going back you've now got a micro penis you're sexually dysfunctional um and these are the topics that for whatever reason big pharma is allowed to lie about and it's stunning to me that if you were a drug dealer on the streets and you harmed a bunch of people with your drugs you're gonna go to prison right the person who sold the drugs to mac miller the rapper is facing prison time and yet big pharma ex always just have to pay a fine right we lied to you we ruined your life we harmed you we killed some people we caused the opioid crisis now we're causing the gender crisis because it is a crisis that we're on the brink of but all we have to do is pay a fine yeah where where is the justice in that you want to talk about social justice where is where is big pharma social justice yeah and you would think if you didn't know any better this would be an issue that left and right could unite on because the left they're supposed to hate big corporations this is pharmaceutical industry they make billions of dollars like let's hold them accountable shouldn't we all be on the same page but it is very interesting that the one industry the one corporation the one you know billion dollar interest at the left will circle the wagons around and defend to the hilt is the pharmaceutical industry and it's a conspiracy it is an actual conspiracy um against children in particular and it's not just a pharmaceutical it's the pharmaceutical industry alongside the medical industry broadly speaking this includes doctors and then counselors psychiatrists they're all kind of they're all making a lot of money off of this there's there's a lot of money to be made and if you start with a six-year-old boy who's confused about his gender um you could clarify things for him and say oh no you're a boy and that's okay and he'll be fine he'll get over it and and live a happy life but there's no money to be made in that you know it but if you were to fuel that confusion now that's that's millions of dollars down the line for therapists doctors pharmaceutical industry never stops yeah you become a big part big pharma patient for life never stops you know there's no like you're not going to need something to deal with what you did to your body early on there's always going to be something and really i think for most people it ends up lifelong mental prescriptions is what it what really happens um matt as a final question to you after doing this documentary seeing the how it's been received in the public sphere are you optimistic or are you pessimistic about this conversation that we're having uh short-term pessimistic just because i think that the the trend that we're on right now is is not going to be reversed overnight i mean we talk about the generation over generation um doubling and i think that's going to continue for a while but long term i'm optimistic because i think that this is a fight we can actually win i i don't say that about every fight in the culture but this is one we can actually win and because gender ideology is so toxic and damaging and in insane in a way that almost everyone intuitively recognizes but they've been scared into silence what we tried to show in the film is that all you have to do is just stand up in front of it look it in the face and ask it a few basic questions and it collapses in on itself so it's very beatable um it's not something we're going to win by flipping a switch or win it overnight but we can win it we just have to have a little bit of uh courage i suppose that's the most optimism i've ever seen from you matt walsh that's the most you're going to get it i'm ever going to get yeah it's 50 optimism i will take it ladies and gentlemen in a word this documentary is illuminating be sure to check out what is a woman on what is a woman.com and make sure to purchase the what is a woman book which is releasing on june 14th it goes even

everyone can say the N word everybody can say the N word because Hunter Biden has made it okay he shot I mean let's just get to these two messages because they're really funny um oh my God Edward did you just a fictional character from the imagination of the collective frightened and my dead Brothers this doesn't even make any sense unconditional love is what I should rely on and my kids aren't children George my penis as of late has been unconditional for my penis that's Hunter that's that's Hunter blue don't know what's going on in this conversation then in another another time he talks he says the n-word again uh because n-word you better not be charging me Hennessy rates um okay media crickets on this story I guess Biden gets another pass the Biden family gets another pass how do you talk to your white friend I don't even talk to my black twin it's really bizarre it's just it just doesn't make any sense he had to be in high when he said all it is yeah he must have been yeah he must be been well it is interesting too because when you look at the New York Times they covered what Morgan Wallen said the n-word and they covered it 14 times there was some random 15 year old cheerleader yeah there it is and who was on uh the front page in the New York Times no one knew who she was they covered that but now all of a sudden crickets it's almost as if it's just a tool that they have and not an actual value they're absolutely right it's a great tool suspended indefinitely by his record label Hunter Biden has a book beautiful things precious things absolute flop you know and you know it just this laptop the text messages the thing that bothers me now is like the slow leak of all this stuff we all saw it months ago you know privately and nobody wanted to cover it you know when Joe Biden was running but this family has been so openly racist like people are like oh I actually had a guy Mark Lamont Hill you guys might be familiar with him uh I hate that guy he definitely does not love us and he decided to tweet me back and say we are talking about the story Candace we're just focusing on other more critical issues too see here I watched this clip first off nobody knows what the show is I think it's just him sitting in his basement talking about random things but he actually defends Hunter Biden by saying it's not Joe Biden and it's not Joe Biden and what we need to be focused on rather than Hunter Biden is voting rights that are being stripped from people of color and it's just like are you kidding me could you imagine if Don Trump Jr was texting people like this and it leads to the Press yeah I know this should be an eye-opener because all these things are coming out from these emails I mean this guy was using his his dad's power to gain you know make a lot of money overseas and nobody's looking into that it's just it's just a ugly double standard I mean they're just they're just the Biden family in general is just so corrupt and it seems to me like they always get a pass no matter what if you're a Democrat full stop you always get in fact when people get into trouble they should just say I'm actually a Democrat and that should be that should be right the end of it right it's a great path when he there's a picture with a crack pipe hanging out of his mouth right what if it was Trump Jr and by the way when people tried to share that on social media they got banned yeah right same thing missing contents yeah missing context there's more to know about this crack pipe now so we're gonna have to pull it down I don't want to know it actually we've been labeled homophobic because we did the video about the transgender when the GameStop and uh I always say in a video you say the dude made an honest mistake you look like a dude with long hair yeah we've had four shows canceled us because he said we're scared of gay people I mean who was scared of a gay person that's my thing when people always say oh you're transphobic because I don't believe children should be injected with hormones and I'm like no I'm actually not scared when I see a man wearing a dress that seems to be the general gist is that conservatives we do something we're called a bunch of names shut down Hunter Biden likely is going to have a second book because he's been dropping and it'll be called I don't know more beautiful things yeah even prettier things or something like that", "nuVT-PKvBQ4": "so the premiere went off without a hitch it was absolutely amazing it was great to have all of my friends be a part of it we had a lot of Warriors cultural Warriors as I would say that attended we had Brittany Aldean as you know she notoriously stood up to the trans agenda and caught a lot of heat within country music that is the wife of Jason Aldean he also attended I think my favorite part of the evening was getting Kid Rock and Kanye West talking outside of the venue they just had a total Vibe about themselves everyone was in amazing Spirits we also had the Entertainer Ray J there just a ton of people that are support more importantly my family and I just want to express and I'm going to give you guys the speech that I gave on stage I just want to express my gratitude that I continually have an audience of people who listen to and support me and who respond to me who give me good feedback who allow me to grow who understand this most important mission for the future a future which we need to determine for the sake of our children my children and it's the reason that I fight I had an amazing team around me last night family around me and I guess I just want to give you guys that behind the scenes listen to what I said when I entered the stage take a listen thank you so much I'm honored to be here I am honored to be able to speak out and eulogize the black lives matter movement the life and the death of an organization that tore this country apart what can we say about black lives matter well the first thing that I would say is that we all know that it has been a scam it has been a scam that has essentially operated with a figurative gun to every single American's head it is a scam that Finds Its basis in stupidity people posting black squares is a my favorite moment I think from the black lives matter movement demanding that every single person posts a black Square to prove that they weren't racist this documentary was one of the most important things for me to make and there's a ton of people in this room that I need to thank for this moment and bringing this to the public but it was important for me to make because it is really the story of the media it was Malcolm X that warned us of the media's power how it can make friends your enemies and enemies your friends how it can tell you to hate someone overnight and we essentially get in line the media truly is the most powerful entity on Earth and there was no greater example of that in my lifetime than the George Floyd story we decided to name it the greatest lie ever sold because what the media is in the business of is selling lies selling lies to people in their households and getting people to hate one another this story was personal to me because when I went out into the public sphere and I interjected just a little bit of Truth which you guys are going to see I was castigated not only by the media but by my own black peers I was told that I wasn't allowed to say the truth about who and what George Floyd was because the victim narrative felt too good and people had become so comfortable in being the victim and being treated like the victim I believe honestly that what we are seeing in America is an entire group of people that are being trained to race to the bottom people are fighting to be oppressed people want to be able to jump on board and accuse one another of oppressing constantly what I was talking to about with my friend yay is that we are very quickly arriving in a trauma economy where people want to constantly pretend to be traumatized by various instances and what it's ultimately doing is it's weakening all of us it's weakening all of our relationships with one another and I think the greatest thing is that it's weakening our relationship with God we exist together as one nation under God right it's important to say under God not beside God not on top of God not above God but under God and what this culture has become largely has been an Atheist culture and I can talk to you about how they did it to Black America and it's important to understand the story of Black America because if Black America was the experiment in understanding how you could sell trauma to a group of people then right now they are running that experiment on all human beings across the globe focusing on Black America First and seeing what happens to a group of individuals that buys the victim narrative that believes that they can be nothing else but oppressed they never get ahead in their lives they never at the top of companies and they are consistently told that it's because of racism and not because they have no belief in themselves I want to obviously allow you guys to watch documentaries so I don't want to say too much other than to first and foremost thank God I had the most liberal route to conservatism and I grew up in an incredibly religious household and I resented that when I became a teenager and throughout my college Years I resented that and I became a more secular individual convinced that atheism was the past the path for me but I now realize that and by destroying that pillar of Faith in American society every other ill has followed when we talk about why it is that we have so many black Americans that can't read and so many black Americans that can't get ahead it's because after they destroyed the god pillar they went after families it is why the topic of broken families is not a joke it is not a joke people will tell you the incarceration rates that face black men but they won't communicate to you how many of those black men grew up without a father in a home the denigration of men that we are seeing in society with movements like me too with movements like time's up fraudulent movements that are actually around just to disempower manhood and to make manhood obsolete let me tell you there is no country and there is no household within a country that can survive without strong men we need men but the radicalized feminist movement is teaching us the exact opposite it is teaching us that women can do it all by themselves and that to Aspire to family and to Aspire to children and to Aspire to being a CEO as women are in their households is something that should be looked down upon it is because they destroyed family and it's because Black America has a 74 single motherhood rate that we are seeing these individuals turn to culture naturally because the government knows that if there's not a mom and a dad sitting around the dinner table then those kids are going to pursue maternity and paternity elsewhere that elsewhere tends to be the streets that elsewhere tends to be when they put on their headphones and they listen to hip-hop music and suddenly they are emulating the people that they see on their screens and on TV shows aspiring to that lifestyle and not aspiring to something better the last pillar beyond faith and beyond family that we have to talk about is the education system which is systematically teaching children to be dumb and to be emotional so that they can use narratives like the black lives matter narrative to inspire them to go outside and to act like fools and that obviously is a pillar that many people in this room have been fighting and it is the ultimate fight because we are what we are fighting for is for our children to know the truth and you understand that of course in this room we represent counter culture we did this counter-cultural thing by talking about God and talking about families for whatever reason that is against the stream the mainstream if you will media but the most important thing is to make sure that we fight for the future of our children they cannot survive in this world that's really it beyond that I thanked my incredible team which made this documentary possible I mean I just can't express to you enough how grateful I am thank you for joining me today come back tomorrow for an all new episode I will see you then [Music] thank you", "fNNlf_7nC7Y": "i just have to say that i object strenuously to your use of the worst word hilarious um to me this feels a lot like your reaction to being named in one of these manifestos now you're of course not responsible for the words of somebody writing that document but i do think that laughing at it is a real problem because these are real families that are impacted by this violence and i think our efforts towards talking about this have to start from a place of mutual respect which is what i've heard from from this side of the table now the reason we don't have those numbers i want those numbers as much as you do but the number to say the numbers don't show something is simply not supported by the data okay and i have 38 seconds left ms mulligan if you can if you want to respond within that time the only thing i would add is that um it's in the name terrorism domestic terrorism it terrorizes us it terrorizes us in our homes it terrorizes us in our schools um and the and to the points made by the other panelists it is disproportionate um to its impact on any individual life and it's not you reject the idea of something that doesn't matter or it doesn't really matter absolutely reject it okay all right so here's where we are every every member now has had five minutes and okay and mr clay so we have two members who have not so i'm gonna go to the two members who have not yet and then and we'll give an opportunity for a closing thought to any member who wants before we go my next responder is mr medellin i thought mr meadows was about us okay mr meadows and x and mr clay then to you mr jordan uh miss owens obviously this is a gang up on you you know we're we're giving uh these witnesses the ability to do a rebuttal on you and so um you know i i find it unfair miss blue i mean you know candidly for you to show mutual respect and then you to go after miss owens it's not appropriate so miss owens you can have four minutes and 34 seconds to respond for a second i'll yield thank you uh i believe miss owens when you use the word hilarious it was in it was referencing the fact that no one had asked you a question it wasn't to the subject matter of the hearing is that right that is correct and for to have another witness insinuate something that is not accurate is just not appropriate mr chairman for how witnesses are supposed to behave in front of this committee i also think you didn't say it doesn't matter about the subject matter of today's hearing you said there are other subjects that matter as well and maybe we should spend some time on those is that accurate that is correct and they matter much much much much more and i have said that i said that in my opening and i will say it again you know that white supremacy and white nationalism is nowhere near ranks nowhere near the top of the issues that are facing black america and the reason that you are bringing them up in this room is because it is attempt to make the election all about race as the democrats not in my case please do not characterize my motive mr chairman it's my time it's my time you've got your time mr meadows i'll give you three more seconds every four years you bring up race and you knew exactly what i meant when i said hilarious and you just tried to do live what the media does all the time to republicans to our president and to conservatives which you tried to manipulate what i said to fit your narrative okay i was not referring to the subject matter that is hilarious i said it's hilarious that we are sitting in this room today and i've got two doctors and a misses and nobody can give us real numbers that we can respond to so we can assess how big of a threat this is because you know that it is not as big of a threat as you are trying to make it out to be so you can manipulate and the audacity of you to bring up the christ church shooting manifesto and make it seem as if i laughed at people that were slaughtered by a homicidal media maniac is in my opinion absolutely despicable and i think that we should be above that to try to assign reality or any meaning to a homicide homicidal maniac writing a manifesto which by the way let the record show also stated spyro the dragon the child's cartoon as a source of inspiration he also cited nelson mandela as a source of information i don't think i don't think that nelson mandela has inspired mosque shootings you can correct me if you think i'm wrong you would rather assign meaning to a homicidal maniac than to actually address that i said to the things that i said today that are actually harming black america number one father absence number two the education system and the illiteracy rate illegal immigration ranks high abortion ranks high white supremacy and white nationalism if i had to make a list again of 100 things would not be on it this hearing in my opinion is a farce and it is ironic that you're sitting here and you're having three caucasian people testify and tell you what their expertise are do i know my expertise are black in america i've been black in america my whole life all 30 years and i can tell you that you guys have done the exact same thing every four years ahead of an election cycle and it needs to stop", "_a2LibApXfg": "all right so last week i had said that pedophilia is around the corner it's pretty obvious if you're paying any attention at all that they're gonna start saying okay like you know pedophilia it's not really that bad um that seems obvious to me i of course got attacked by media matters because they love the show hello media matters it's me the pr department standing by it the slippery slope is real let's watch this montage of where we're at i guess in society of identifying [Music] toy self a toy she's a toy those are her main pronouns thank you for respecting her identity she's a fish fishes which is you can really say fish self [Music] this is real it's not a joke and y'all thought me teaching the children about me being polly was crazy but not only that but they also know that i'm gender fluid when i also explain to them that i'm pagan so i am also a witch i don't know who needs to hear this but top surgery is for anybody there's no template for what you must look like after top surgery what makes life so beautiful is the diversity in its people non-binary humans exist and we legally are acknowledged now i have an x on my license so calling me a woman is discrimination girl calling you stable would be discrimination take it away gentlemen what are we looking at here like there's no standard for what these bodies have to look like that much is very clear like you've made it clear that there is no standard no i mean it is it it's always very sad to me to watch these mostly children or the adults who are you know bringing these children in what you're observing is a theology it's a cult this is a religion and there are religious convictions associated with it you know i mean this is essentially a state established religion and there's no limiting principle to it it's it's simply a kind of just you know break down all the walls and and you know they get these kids on as you said on your monologue hand is they become perma clients of big pharma i mean that's really who's benefiting here right who's to who's good is this it's not to the kids right these kids that have been you know so terribly uh desensitized and just you know it makes them essentially into victims of of the state right yeah i think that the only uh justification god needs to condemn the world is the existence of tick tock uh genuinely speaking spend a little bit of time on there and you're like god end the world now it's a little late actually but but when you look at this i mean i paid 35 in the state of california to become non-binary so i kind of demand respect a little bit i got a gender x on my id uh i revoked my manhood and i knew that it was all bs when i stood there with my wife looking at the lady and she goes so you're not a man i went i'm a net ask the wife i'm an ex and that's what it is it's all made up in their heads they want to feel special and quite frankly like that shrek fiona looking girl in the in the second video with the green hair yeah i mean they intentionally try to look ugly and it's just not going to fly because in the end god didn't create us to look like this he didn't create us to act like this and these people are absolutely insane and i'm just saying this is state sponsored this is socially sponsored text sponsored mental illness it is 100 it's funny too because you can tell just how starved the younger generations are of having a sense of identity like they really want this attention drawn to themselves because every other generation probably in human history could have an identity whether it's a religious identity cultural identity all of our identities have been purposefully eroded through public education after world war ii because they thought that they could like literally take everything that a man would have to stand up for away from them so as to prevent world war iii this was written about in the authoritarian personality and so now the only gen identities that you're allowed to have in this generation are those that are basically state adjacent so you can have an identity in the victim hierarchy as like a member of the lgbt community or as a minority but you're not allowed to say you're a christian an american or anything like that that would actually compel someone to want to stand up for something good yeah i actually wrote in my book i have this whole theory that what's actually happening is this thing that i call over civilization which is like it's natural for humans to want to strive towards something right towards some goal like you want to be like we're the generation that ended this you know segregation we're the generation that ended this and unfortunately when you arrive at society where all the problems have basically been solved and people are privileged and actually by and large over privileged they still have this like yearning to achieve something so they arrive at like over civilization which is like you're you get back to the beginning on a lot of these topics and you get back to just blatant foolishness right so it's like we've got everything we've wanted so let's just make up stuff oh have they already they've given us gay marriage okay okay so let's uh now say that we need trans fish shelves to fish shelves is that what she said you know to be able to marry wiccan what pagan i mean like it gets nuts because they want to feel like they've done something and at the end of the day these people are just losers and if i walk into a classroom and saw any of that trying to teach my kid my child would be unenrolled let's talk about cancer culture and what you can do about it particularly on social media the left wants to silence you and any voices that they don't agree with twitter and facebook were supposed to be open platforms i don't need their content moderators acting like the op-ed sections of the new york times you could just deactivate all your social media accounts but that would be giving the left exactly what they wanted in the first place instead i used expressvpn ever wondered how free to access sites like facebook make all their money well it's by tracking your searches your video history and everything that you click on and then selling on your valuable data when you use expressvpn you anonymize much of your online presence by hiding your ip address that makes your activity more difficult to trace and sell to advertisers

that felt so innocuous the time when I shared it I was working on this episode I was interested in I have been interested in the psychological immune system of women and men and the online world and social media and I specifically wanted to lean in to women that are getting a lot of work done obviously the people getting worked on has exploded over the years and it was not so popular 20 years ago now it's very popular I have tons of friends who get work done I do not hate on women getting worked on whatsoever but I was curious as to whether or not women that get work done we're getting it done for men so obviously I thought a good question a good starting place for this investigation would be me asking men if they think that women that get work done if it's appealing to them if they find it attractive and so I wrote serious question for men do you think that Botox filler fake lips look is attractive do you envision in long-term relationship with those girls that look that way male opinions only please working on a show about social media mutating our appetites male opinions only please haha that was a sick joke women came in instantly and angrily they were like no no no no no this question is too big this question needs to be more specific Katniss men don't even know when we get a little bit of Botox they don't even know what they like like you need to be more descriptive because if a woman gets a little bit of Botox they can't even tell if it's a little maintenance and the thing is I think men understood the assignment because they all came back and said they didn't like it I mean I am talking 99.98 of men in the comments both on Instagram and on Twitter said no we don't like it women just could not accept or believe that answer it was just really bizarre watching how angry women were getting in the comments trying to justify having this work done they were going well you go look at the the follows of those men they all follow these girls that look like porn stars okay fair commentary back but why don't we just believe men when they're telling you that they don't like the overdone look and I think some men clarified yes you know I assume that these girls have low self-esteem that they're trashy and that they could be good for a hookup right but I don't want to make her my wife which means they understood the assignment that I was asking them because I just wanted to know if they're into that look and usually typically women will say my husband says I don't need it my husband says he doesn't like it and these other women that were for some reason answering this question even though I only asked men were basically arguing that will they prefer women that look younger but men were saying we don't actually think you look younger right they said actually I think it ages a woman that when I see a woman that gets a ton of work done my immediate mindset is okay she must be at least 40 and trying to hang on to her youth because it doesn't look natural and then women came back and said oh well you wouldn't even it's just like the makeup argument men think most women are natural with their makeup they still have a little bit of makeup on okay well that still proves if they only like a one that have a little bit of makeup on enough to fool them that they prefer natural looking women to women that are all the way done up so I think men are being consistent here and telling you that they prefer natural beauty and what was weird about the women getting angry is that this would have been a good time to say thank you men right thank you for saying that I look beautiful without makeup and without a bunch of work done because now I know that I don't have to spend this much money on work done but instead women were sort of imploding and were very angry at men but so the end of this I'll read you a few of the guys comments here huge turn off Botox and lip fillers can take an already gorgeous woman and suddenly make them significantly less attractive with only that small change natural is definitely 10 times more attractive and preferred another man writes no never to the question of do they like it I don't know why this is even a thing a woman wrote woman don't get toxins and fillers for men they do it for who judges them most which is other women don't believe or read any thread on Reddit and see how women break other women down by speaking of their hair now skin routines and even how they parent I believe that is true I do believe that women do it for other women which I wanted to investigate and I believe that women do it because of other women beating them down or because women as I said earlier have a weaker psychological immune system when it comes to the online world I think women are more responsive to things that are trending on the internet women spend more time on Instagram I think women spend more time you know following Keeping Up with the Kardashians and watching The Real Housewives and seeing women that have all this work done and then they somehow view it as aspirational they see it as a form of luxury and that these women look better somehow but the men when they weigh in on this across the board said no we actually think that given a picture when you show me a girl before she said work done after I prefer her when she looks natural maybe just believe that that is what men believe another person man writes no no and no another guy writes like shoes and nails they don't do it for men but for the competition between other women another man writes they all look alike when they do it they look like they are all cousins another guy writes no it looks fake and bad I love a more natural look all day long again these were all of the comments they were consistent so I am still working on the episode where I would like to talk about women's psychological immune system and why women even when they are told you are beautiful by a man just the way you are still do not accept that what does making women believe that men just are lying online and that they just don't know that they're tricking them with botox but there's probably a lot more to unpack and we're not going to get to it today all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the

differently i feel very emotional about it and part of those emotions that i'm going through is a lot of anger and frustration i get angry when people go online and they say i don't understand i don't understand how this could possibly happen i don't understand what would possess somebody to go buy an ak-47 and shoot up in elementary school you know what i don't understand i don't understand why these people don't understand how we get to this point in society look around you we have normalized every single step of mental illness so it's difficult for me to comprehend what it is to these people that becomes the red line think about it think about everything going on every single day that the majority of people don't have the courage to stand up to for example i just made this is a quick list right it must be the mutilation of bodies of these young children's bodies right that's really making people stand up and say something but these same people stand behind children being aborted in the womb up to nine months where is your red line on that is it the mutilation of innocent life is that is that where the red line is i'm only asking because i feel like it was just a couple of weeks ago when we were being told the women were marching in the street demanding the right to end a infant an infant's life when they're in the womb like right now right i'm eight and a half months pregnant about to give birth people think that i should just be able to go my body my choice right oh but candace that's different it's so different because like it's happening inside of my body and so like that's fine millions and millions of infants being taken out having their bodies ripped limb for limb that's totally fine that's different this is a totally different scenario is it the mutilation of of bodies that that's really sticking in your head like when we talk about the gender debate and you have these young children that are being encouraged to mutilate their own bodies to go on puberty blockers to go get surgery right to go get permanently alter their bodies with surgery because they have a feeling that's being encouraged to them in the classroom oh but candice that's different we have to be more accepting that's a part of lgbtqia qrs rights did you was that your red line oh no that's different you've in your head you've programmed yourself they've programmed themselves to believe that that is somehow different the suicide rates what about covid people that are pretending that they care about the life of children these are the same people that were happy or at least didn't say anything when suicide rates were exploding across the country as these children were forced to stay at home and then even when they went to school were allowed to finally go back to school and have communication with one another were forced to sit behind masks for hours and hours and hours for a virus that they had a virtual zero percent chance of dying from didn't matter nobody cared nobody cared oh that's different candace because there was a pandemic and it just i don't know made me feel more comfortable to see two-year-olds that were being masked i felt safer or something but i value life this is my red line is the elementary school candice not all of that not the kids committing suicide and mutilating their bodies none of that i'm also enjoying all of the celebrities who have mutilated their own faces over the last couple of years right you look at the before and after picture of these celebrities look nothing like what they looked like they literally go in and say i want a different face because they're mentally ill and they're sick we live in that society right these are the celebrities that stand up and say i just don't understand what could ever possess somebody to do something so crazy i know that i can mentally get to a place where i slaughter my own face but please hear it from me hear it from me about the mental illness in our society that's pervasive take the guns away that's the problem all right ladies and gentlemen it is officially grilling season and you know that i'll be getting all of my beef chicken and seafood from

line is it because this was a particularly violent crime well you didn't have that issue when we had black lives matter riots you stayed quiet because that was different candace it was totally fine to burn down cities because like racism is different and like we had to post a black square and and it was important to allow people that were violent criminals to commit violent crimes so they could you know let out their anger about the injustices look around you we live in a society where violence and mutilation and death is abundant how dare you ask the question now how did we get here how dare you make a post about what needs to be done when you didn't have the courage to say anything about any of these topics when you still don't have the courage because you're afraid of being cancelled i have celebrities that follow me under fake accounts i speak to them regularly but they're afraid to say i follow candace owens and i agree that we shouldn't be doing these things because they don't want their entire lives to be ruined celebrities under duress too fearful to say what is abundantly clear our society is almost facing a terminal illness and that terminal illness is due to the fact that we have an abundance of cowardice we are facing a deficit of courage in this country and all around the world right now that's the truth that's what's going on people are posting their mental illnesses in their twitter bios these are my pronouns i'm a fish today i'm a fish and if you say anything about it you're transphobic and i'm gonna send a mob on you maybe that's the answer maybe it's because we avoid saying that these are obvious clues that this person is mentally ill thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring

happens it provides an opportunity for other crazy people to hide and to say oh see i'm not that crazy so they get to point the finger and say oh my god see that is completely mentally unstable but don't look at me even though there is a proven track record of my mental unstableness and that would be of course chrissy teigen who after the olvate shooting had the nerve had the tremendous nerve to race to instagram and to attack people that were speaking at the nra convention so this is the post i'm going to read you what she wrote she basically shared an article about trump cruz and abbott who were scheduled obviously way in advance of the shooting to speak at the nra meeting and she posted this and she wrote loving guns this much is effing weird it's not normal it's not fun for the whole family it's effing weird f everyone going to this meeting f the convention center for holding it but most of effing all f anyone's being at it for amplifying and touting this gun-loving psychosis as something associated with freedom and fun to be clear it's weird and you're effing weird that is chrissy teigen yep you're probably going that can't be the same chrissy teigen that was sliding into the dms of teenagers telling them to kill themselves that would be that would be effing weird right that'd be effing weird if that was the same chrissy teigen but guess what guys it is the same chrissy teigen she's just forgiven herself she's like whatever whatever now someone else is something crazy and now i can tell other people who have nothing to do with the something crazy that that other crazy person did that they suck more than me so here's a little flashback of chrissy teigen who told courtney stodden who at the time was a teenager that she fantasized about her taking a dirt nap on twitter of course remember courtney saudin came out and said that not only was she publicly posting that she was privately dming her telling her to kill herself but as i said chrissy teigen has forgiven herself and now she's a spokesperson for life and against guns so just forget about that time that she actually was pro-gun and pro-suicide when she wrote this to sarah palin listen i don't want much from sarah palin i just want her to admit partial fault then shoot herself in the face is that wrong apparently not in christian tegan said it's not wrong it's just you know when she wants guns to be used for violence it's acceptable and you guys need to move on i mean i just i just cannot imagine that she consistently works up the nerve to pretend that she is a better person than anybody but that's what happens when something tragic happens in society as i said people that are mentally ill come out of the woodwork and they start telling you how society should be run so chrissy teigen i really just have to give my hats off to you my hat off to you pardon for having the courage to speak out against gun violence when you're not the person that's promoting it amen chrissy it's no secret that out of control inflation is hammering the stock market for example amazon stock was down 37 in the first half of the year tesla has been down 40 and the s p 500 is having its worst start to the year since world war ii needless to say now might be a good time to diversify your assets into gold the most stable asset in the history of the world and birch gold is the company that i trust to help you convert an ira or a 401k into an ira in gold and silver that's right not only will birch gold help you fortify your savings with precious metals they'll help you do it in a tax sheltered account text candace to 989898 to get your free no obligation info kit on gold from birch gold text candace to 989898 and to cure your savings now now as we're talking about mental illness you have to understand that we have a society that consistently covers it up so even though i'm showing you on this show what chrissy teigen has said in the past to other individuals you should know that because she's got a ton of money and a ton of wealth at some point after this story exploded about her bullying all of these people she clearly must have reached out to a pr team that had relationships with facebook and facebook went and actually pulled down every trace of everything evil that she's ever said in fact if you share what chrissy teigen said to courtney stodden to courtney sudden or to bristow palin or to sarah palin your account will get a strike yeah how's that for gaslighting instagram and facebook will hit your account if you have the nerve to say hey look what chrissy teigen said that's wrong how do i know that because it happened to me yes almost a year following the chrissy teigen scandal i went on to twitter and i was hit with a strike and they pulled down a post of me simply sharing what chrissy teigen said there was nothing else there it said this is bullying and this is harassment for you to even share the bullying and harassing of what chrissy teigen said i challenge you go back onto instagram and try to find a post this was the biggest news story at the time chrissy teigen telling tons of people to commit suicide she's done a tremendous cleanup job and that is where i feel rat in society where we are now inching toward a society where the job is for all of the social media companies to clean up evidence of mental illness not to talk about it not to address it not to report on it but to clean up evidence of it thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the

be towed in Hollywood recently the first biological mail was announced the winner of Miss greater Dairy which is a beauty pageant that is held by the Miss America organization so this individual goes by the name Brienne and he's become the first transgender to win the title under the Miss America organization he was named the Miss grader Dairy of 2023 which landed him a crown and a scholarship and it was announced this past Sunday now the Miss greater Dairy scholarship program provides scholarships to quote unquote young women between the ages of 17 and 24. now of course every woman should be upset with this because this is quite literally the Erasure of women right it is saying that if a man jumps into a caricature of what it means to be a woman puts on some lipstick and a wig and starts talking in the way that he thinks women talk basically puts on a performance that he should be receiving priority over actual women who are having women experiences throughout their entire life maybe pretending that somehow a man's fetishes mean more than our actual existence I can't think of anything that could be more misogynist than that right and I have said this over and over again when I see a man that says that he's a woman and he's got fake boobs and he talks like a valley girl and he's got a wig on and makeup I feel mocked I feel laughed at especially when they're being over the top as that Tick Tock or a Dylan Mulvaney has been and I'm afraid of bugs and screaming and things of that nature it's a mockery you're looking at women in the face and you're saying there's nothing special about you I can put on aforemention just like you are putting on a performance there's nothing real about you there's nothing substant about you I can be you and now that we've gotten to a place in society where we don't recognize the wrongness in that and we penalize women who speak out and say I don't like that right why I am called a transphobe for saying that rather than calling that man pretending to be me a misogynist you punish me for saying it that is a very scary space to be in in society when people can no longer tell a difference between a lie and the truth and it begins to yell at the truth and tell the truth that it needs to shut up we should not shut up and I'm glad to see that the reactions on social media were mixed and that some women really believe that the win is a reflection of internalized misogyny and one tweet as an example somebody wrote you all know how the left likes to talk about internalized misogyny this is what it actually looks like I could not agree more of that statement how much does a woman have to hate herself that she pretends that a man pretending to be her is more worthy of love and acceptance just makes entirely no sense to me and here is a video by the way of Brienne winning [Music] can we skip to the good part [Music] so there you have it a scholarship opportunity taken away from other women who are all standing next to the plotting pretending that they think that this is fair it's obviously not fair at all for a man to take an opportunity from a woman especially when this opportunity was carved out to be specifically for women but that is where rat and our society Up Is Down and Down is up all right guys that is all in regards to the comments you know the next portion of the show is going to be available

broke the internet because I wore a white lives matter t-shirt how dare I well I dare to do it because it's true my lives matter right if black lives matter White lives matter Asian lives matter I don't know what the problem is but apparently there is a problem and speaking of Reddit I want to draw this to your attention so problematic so problematic was it that Connie and I decided to wear these t-shirts that a Reddit thread uh was started the community on Reddit is called NYC influencer snark and somebody anonymously posted celebs that follow Candace Owens question mark question mark and they are doing this because they want to draw to attention what celebrities follow me you know I have what 4.3 million followers followers they can now conclude that if you follow Candace Owens you must therefore be somebody that supports ideas that they disagree with and so what they're trying to do is create an army to go after and to attack these individuals now I speak about a range of topics who knows why people follow me it might be simply because they hate me and they're following me because they're journalists and they want to report on the things that I say a lot of journalists follow me maybe you're an influencer and you follow Candace Owens because I speak out about the childhood vaccine schedule because you are pregnant and you are thinking about having children and so you follow me because you're waiting for that information maybe you follow me because gasp you like me and you think I'm awesome and you just want to follow maybe you follow me because you love the family stuff the pro family stuff that I that I post maybe you follow me because you enjoyed the stuff that I said about Donald Trump during his policy I don't know what the reason is for each and every individual follow I know I have a lot of haters and I have a lot of lovers out there but irrespective of what your reasons are This Thread is essentially demanding that people are harassed that's what they're asking for right the the party of Tolerance the tolerant people they're so tolerant that they want to have an army to send on you they want to send an army out to say this person should lose their job if you read throughout the thread people commenting it's like oh my gosh this person oh my God this person we should report this person for this I hope this person gets fired they're even suggesting that somebody who works for Peloton who recently got fired and happened to have followed me maybe he got fired for following me which would be the most bizarre thing in the entire world Imagine your boss sitting you down and saying we're letting you go because we realized that you follow Kanye West would be like I'm sorry what yeah we realize that you're following Kanye West and so we're gonna have to let you go is this really where the world is coming to that individuals now have to be concerned about who they're following on Instagram I accidentally follow people I mean sometimes literally I go to my phone list and I'm like wow I must have just been scrolling and hit the follow button I have no idea why I'm following this individual well you better be careful with your thumbs and careful with your fingers because God forbid you accidentally followed me you might be losing your job this is what the people on the left are all about acceptance tolerance we love love is love except really we hate you unless you agree with every single thing that we say and unless you comply with the individuals that we say you should like how's that for the party and the group of the most tolerant in America keep your eye on that because it's pretty sick and it's pretty Twisted next up in the continuing drama between between Kanye West and all of these celebrities who love black lives matter you know they just really care about black people Gigi Hadid was apparently very upset and thought that it would be a good idea to use her platform to speak out on behalf of Vogue editor Gabriella karifa Johnson probably because this Vogue editor is black and this would have been some good virtue signaling for Gigi Hadid so she speaks out because Gabriella karifa Johnson the Vogue editor was invited to a show she was there and as she was at the show she somehow made the show about herself and pretended that she was under attack so she was posting live on Instagram throughout the show first she posts a black model walking down the runway who was wearing a white lives matter shirt she posted a photo of her and wrote here comes the followed by I'm fuming collecting my thoughts DM me for my working thesis indefensible behavior and then she wrote on her Instagram page it's become clear that some viewers think my previous post containing my working evolving thoughts on Kanye's show was some sort of distorted justification for the incredibly irresponsible and dangerous Act of sending White lives Matter t-shirts down a Runway dangerous my God please understand it wasn't the t-shirts this man conceived produced and shared with the world are pure violence okay there is no excuse there is no art here I'm sorry I failed to make that clear I thought I did I do think if you asked Kanye he would say there was Art and Revolution and all the things in that t-shirt there isn't as we all work through the trauma of this moment especially those of us who suffered in that room let's have some Grace for one another Gabriella K Vogue editor trauma violence dangerous suffering all of my favorite leftist bingo words she's so sad guys she had to go to Paris and go into a room and watch a billionaire present his show and God forbid she saw a T-shirt and she's now suffering trauma I mean could she speak even louder could she ever be clearer in the message that I have about how weak Black America has become decades ago you had people like my grandfather who grew up on sharecropping Farms right who had to wake up at the crack of dawn and Under the Carolina heat lay out crops to dry when he was five years old fast forward and you got big girl Gabriella uh in her really ugly shoes which is what Kanye came back to her and said that you are clearly he posted her on his Instagram and said this is not a fashion person and he's right if you see what she's wearing she looks absolutely ridiculous she was probably a diversity and inclusion hire over at Vogue but fast forward to years later decades later and this woman thinks this is suffering she actually thinks she's suffering because she was made to go to a fashion show in Paris this is pathetic this woman is pathetic worse than unfashionable she is emblematic of the corrosion of Black America while they're trying to tell you that we're strong right because we're wearing BLM t-shirts and we're riding looting our own communities what you're actually seeing is a severely weakened Community severely with the community and emotionally weak Community that's the truth and that's why people hate me because I just tell them the truth you're weak so Gigi Hadid decided to jump in in defense of this woman and she wrote to Kanye you wish you had a percentage of her intellect you have no idea if there's actually a point to any of your she might be the only person that could save you as if the honor of being invited to your show should keep someone from giving their opinion LOL you're a bully and a joke that's from Gigi Hadid what's interesting about Gigi Hadid by the way fun fact her sister is Bella Hadid who's another model who I actually thought quite bravely used her platform uh they are Palestinian and she sort of stood up to the Mob that was telling her that Hollywood is not allowed to be pro-palestine I don't have a horse in the race don't need to get into it but you know Israel and Palestine have been in Conflict it feels like since forever the Israelis and the Palestinians pardon um and she Bella Hadid stood up and said what's happening a Palestinian is wrong you had the media attacking her and she kind of withstood the storm to say this is my perspective as somebody who is Palestinian Gigi was silent though she didn't say anything so it's weird that this is what she decides to use her platform form of fashion dispute and I weighed in and asked her if she is going to be speaking out on bullying in Hollywood I'd love to see it I think you're great I think your mom's great I think Bella's great where were you on Chrissy Teigen because she was actually if you think Kanye posting a picture of this woman and saying that she dresses bad which is like saying water is wet right it's a form of bullying where were you on Chrissy Teigen when she was celebrated by the media for years and I used my platform to expose how she was telling teenagers to kill themselves Connie didn't tell Gabriella to kill herself your soul should dress better and she should because she's at Vogue and Anna Wintour probably doesn't like her shoes like Kanye said I don't know just an opinion so we will leave that out for Gigi and and see if she's going to continue to weigh in on bullying The Bullying that takes place in Hollywood routinely and the bullying that is taking place right now because Kanye refuses to conform to the black lives matter narrative which all of you just wear the t-shirts and post black squares to make yourself feel like you're getting involved in helping Black America when the evidence is in front of you you're not you're harming us so please stop doing that please Gigi all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be

to do an update on this story since i acted it out last week it turns out shockingly that the jury found jesse smollett guilty i'm so really surprised which is like enough crazy what are you racists clapping about this man was abused by two giant black nigerian men who looked white at nighttime while he was trying to get a subway sandwich i mean obviously we don't know what that what time they're going to give him i think he needs to see jail time absolutely he should get the maximum penalty i think it was like three three years or something like that it could be the max i think they should throw the book at him there's nowhere in the world that a grown man in this was in 2020 2018 should be promoting fake hate crimes that tells you in my personal opinion at the state of racism in our country that racism is such a dying sport that people have to recreate it especially an unbelievable story how could you be more stupid you know nobody's two white guys at least at least he could have picked white guys to beat him up he picked the book he picked the blackest dudes he could find i mean at least get some ice skating brothers or something i know i know that's so true like the african accents like it's just the worst part to me is that he he didn't apologize and he's still doubling down that it wasn't a hoax yeah that's the only reason i think he should see jail time i agree he had come clean instantly it was like listen man this was a bad idea i want a back pedal here it didn't happen i don't know what i was thinking i would be so much more lenient and be like listen like actors are crazy and he got a little fired up but he held on to this to the end and the acting on the stand of still saying like i'm the black i forgot what he said i'm the i'm the blackness and that as a gay man in america i don't want this to happen to me i was like he's still trying to push this he's a victim narrative well and he should pay the price not just for his lies and his actions but for the damage he's done long term with racial issues i mean he's making things so much worse and this has been going on for three years now i have to talk to you about a great idea for holiday gifts

i looked at this picture and i was just like look at the mother and his sisters holding if my husband ever faked a hate crime i am not holding his arm into the i'm gonna be like lock him up that's a famous actress by the way his sister journey she's a very famous actress and she's she's very respected i respect her i've seen tons of her movies it's like totally embarrassing what he's done to this family and people should not be standing by him at all but i want to remind you guys of the part that no one's talking about which is that before he faked the hate crime a week later a week prior to he wrote himself a letter to the set of empire and this is the letter okay that's right first fake postage stamp in the corner says right justin look at how this is like crazy look at how he wrote like jesse smullet empire we're in like a six-year-old he drew a penis on the right-hand side and it says like you dub black you know expletive against um gay people and a gun pointing to his head like guys this is not normal behavior an adult sat down and did this and mailed it to himself this is some like whitney houston like like the zodiac killer he sat and found a magazine and cut out the letters and mailed it like this is not he should have played insanity and i would have believed him was that on like blm's pinterest page i don't know what's what's worse you know him actually doing this or being so bad at it man i mean this is it's unbelievable no racist is gonna do this type of stuff i'm honestly shocked they didn't take the celebrity route of like he's dealing with mental illness and he's checking himself in because he's going through some things he's just doubling down like no i'm a victim right no i'm a victim right i hope they have arts and crafts in prison seems to enjoy it he's good at it and we have to do this flashback of the celebrities who bought into this ridiculous story let's just watch them let's just watch celebrities be celebrities this is about coming to the aid of another brother that has tasted the brutality of hatred racism and bigotry in this situation hate won't win it will not you didn't deserve nor anybody deserves to have a noose put around your neck he had bleach poured onto him this needs to stop he will forgive these people for what they did and but he won't and we cannot forget their actions and hopefully this just opens up opens up people's eyes it's just what needs to stop man damn why are we going backwards but i don't like that it's being put out there in the media that this is a possible hate crime i think that even souls a seed that makes people feel like well is he making this up or what is this about right i don't like that like don't put that in people's minds this man was hurt he was injured and he needs justice we have a media that's saying it's a debate whether or not what just happened to jesse small it is a hate crime it's absurd this isn't a debate [Laughter] listen i just want to say this in case anybody has missed it it's 2021. anytime somebody tells you a noose was used to kill someone you can just assume it's a lie i mean this just doesn't happen kids are not tying nuisance this is like the smartphone generation like nobody knows how to tie a knot or their own shoes anymore you know what i mean like sweet you didn't need to take a mental health day i almost did i almost didn't yeah that noose triggered me the attack string around his neck that they call the news and it's just so ridiculous thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you'd like to join the daily

left so i'm going to toss you a fun one um alec baldwin is he going to get arrested i don't know look he's been in trouble from day one he didn't be he did the imitation of me for years i thought he was irritate him well no i thought it was just yeah that wouldn't be hard uh i thought he did terrible i thought he was terrible at it uh they have other people that do much better but he's always trouble i mean he takes a gun he said he didn't pull the trigger and then the experts get on and say it's not possible that that particular gun can it doesn't work that way in other words it can't happen that it works where you don't pull the trigger and it just happens to go off okay i don't think that was a very good interview for him i just say this he's always trouble he goes out to talk to the press nobody gets treated worse than me by the press and i'm very hostile to them likewise but i don't end up in fistfights with him on the street i mean there's something wrong i think he's crazy there's something crazy and he pointed the gun he still pointed the gun at this woman and it happened to go off and she wasn't even an actor so it's not like at a scene where it went on during a scene it just he just pointed a gun at her and it went off did he do it on purpose i don't know i mean you tell me he's not stable he's definitely not he's definitely not a stable person he's a nut job actually i actually totally agree with that assessment um i can't thank you enough for sitting down with me and i want to say to people back home each time that i've interviewed president trump they have never told me that i am not allowed to ask him anything he is completely unscripted it's one of the things that fascinates me about him they never say don't go here don't go there what you see is exactly what you get not exactly like joe biden checking uh oh colin call on this one just to interrupt your ending the washington post that's right uh you uh let's say um now here's the worst part though they asked him the question then he reads the answer from a teleprompter i said where did this stuff come from thank you lisa i think that it's possum i mean it's crazy it's a strange deal it's a strange deal and people people needed to see it and so i honestly say in a weird way i thank god for president joe biden because the rest of america was asleep and i think they're awake and i'm inspired to see the mothers getting involved showing up and i think this is going to be a very different we have tremendous support now i have more support now than i did before the election and we had a lot of support but it's so bad our country has never been so embarrassed or disgraced we've never had a country like this and when he does in particular afghanistan to a large extent the borders but when he does that horrible withdrawal again we want to withdraw but with dignity and strength when putin and she president xi of china and kim jong-un of north korea when they're watching and iran when they're watching what happened during that short period of time they lost respect for our country they're all at the top of their game and we have a leader that doesn't have a clue it's a very bad time for our country we've lost the moral high ground we certainly have i certainly have you're right sat down and he basically they were trying to say you're a bad guy and he said you've locked up people that are rotting in prison because of january 6th and i said this is bad that's right we've lost the moral high ground because of what this department of justice is and you haven't heard the beginning they are now every time we say anything that and they go big league they go big league on what they do and they just look at us and what about this this this and that i've never seen it and all you can do is sit there and say well i guess that's right let's get on to the next subject you're right what can we say pretty tough stuff thank you very much", "53wbOiPXQ1w": "this next door that

and pool record in the 1650 yard freestyle finishing more than 38 seconds ahead of the second place contender 38 okay seconds ahead i was a competitive swimmer for 14 years i don't know if people know this but 38 seconds is unheard of if you break a record it's like by milliseconds for a second 38 seconds just shows there's a biological difference it's just like this doesn't happen and so the school has been telling the athletes the women are very upset the young women are upset obviously like imagine working your entire life um you know toward a sport and then it just gets completely dominated and they've been saying hush hush don't say anything but these girls are actually speaking to the press and saying this is ridiculous the coach just wants to win and but the transgendered

records as a man i think in 2017 18 i think he was competing as a man you look at his numbers as a woman and they're not that different i mean he was he still is a competitive person he's been living his life with testosterone flowing through his body and competing and training and then all of a sudden he he tries to be a woman it bothers me that people are so selfish right if i was a man and i wanted to be a woman one day i would if a man play on the stage but now if you know being a man if i wanted to be a woman for some odd reason i would respect women enough to say okay i have an advantage let me sit this one out i chose don't get into sports just don't get in the sport cause you know you're gonna dominate in sports especially because you dominated as a man yeah i'm impressed that the women are speaking out because we saw um harry potter the jk rowling i want to bring that tweet up jk rowling she's the only one who's spoken up about this stuff and she's been canceled so i'm very impressed and i'm glad that these women are in these schools are finally speaking up because in these college campuses these days you'll get kicked off so kudos to them for speaking up because this insanity won't stop until real women speak up and say no no no that's not a woman that's a man who thinks he's a woman which is fine but you cannot compete with women because you are not a woman right exactly so good for them but they're having to they're having to speak up anonymously because they're in fear of losing their their college career in sports and that's terrible yeah they shouldn't have to be anonymous this is crazy and yeah jk rowling had this tweet wars peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength the penis individual who raped you is a woman and she's referring to an article in the uk um that says that police are now logging rapists as women like women raping women when it's actually men that identify as women that are raping women and this is like this is peak lunacy and i always say to this like where are the feminists on this like the whole idea of feminists oh my god men are trying to erase women you quite literally have a circumstance where men are actively erasing women aka rowling got cancelled and the people that she made multi-millionaires the women like who claimed to be feminists and i called out emma watson this weekend because emma watson oh my god is she a feminist she's written articles about how she refuses to let a man pay for her meal on a date and everything she does is about women women women the very first second that the trans the trans men came out and just attacked jk rowling a trans woman i don't even know i can't even men came out and attacked jk rowling she instantly took their side and said oh my gosh like she's transphobic no she's standing up for women and shame on you and every single feminist who self-proclaimed feminist who is silent on this issue when real women are being silenced and being threatened having their entire livelihoods destroyed in the sports category because of men yeah honestly makes me sick it makes me so sick they're all frauds thanks for joining me on this segment of

"8vYUUxHuUnM": "music industry is very small anyway there's not that many people the music press is even smaller and very much of one ideology you know for example here in 2017 they put Jeremy corbyn leader of the labor party on the front cover they're not and did a puff piece interview with him they didn't cover any of the other parties obviously it's that and that's the nature of it it's there's very much a a a a a political agenda there curiously though and this is again perhaps a side we can come back to Jordan that wasn't totally the case in the music industry until 2016 and we put an album out in 2015 and we we did the promo tour press junkets they didn't ask about politics when we put an album out in 2018 Delta they and we did the Press junkets they didn't ask about music it was like something changed Trump and here it was brexit and then they started realizing wait a second perhaps we're not controlling this narrative anymore we need to start making sure every artist has our ideology or they've got to go and curiously you tweeted something and it caused a firestorm what was the Tweet well so through the pandemic I took the opportunity to read all the books I hadn't read and got to read some long Russian uh uh fictions that that have been Gathering dust on the on the bookshelf and uh I was I was as well as I even read Mao's little red book I read your book and um uh blackout and I read everything and um it was a in some sense a great time to do that having worked flat out for 14 years it was my time to unwind and and do some things and and one of the books I tweeted about was Andy knows book unmasked documenting the BLM rights and antifa movement in America through basically 2020 documenting the 19 people killed in the first 14 days of the BLM riots and um I said something like I've forgotten the exact week congratulations Mr and you know you're a brave guy I thought he was Brave because as described in the book he'd been attacked whilst reporting covering these uh these events and um somehow and by the way I had I had no Twitter I had like 3 000 Twitter followers it was not like nothing somehow it just completely exploded and it went up all the trending things and my initial response was like oh it'll just go it'll just pass whatever it's just a thing but then what happens and and people who have had this experience well I've I've shared it with them is it you know they say Twitter isn't real life until it's real life and what happens is then people you start getting the phone calls and people that you love and people that you work with are calling up and then and then it's like it gets real because Twitter isn't really real and and then it becomes real and unfortunately the issue of antifa I think to a lot of people who want let's say following events or um necessarily interested in politics or that it's they don't even know about it and actually this is part of the the problem even with the the the book itself is people don't know about the the businesses being ruined through the BLM rights people don't know I mean you've you've wrote about it in your book and you've and you've talked about it but a lot of my uh friends I have would be like what I never heard about that because the mainstream media don't cover it and actually probably that was part of part of the I was thinking why did I even post this about this book and I think subconsciously one of the reasons is that I was frustrated at seeing mainstream media rightly covering a lot of far-right extremism but not covering for left extremism I was like hang on a sec you've got to do both here and so I felt like it's an important book in the conversation anyway so um the then it became real life and then all things sort of uh imploded in my life and things things completely unraveled what are people calling you and did you actually read this book like what are they saying on the other end of the line like it's it's like how could this have been a firestorm congratulations on the book you're a brave man and he knows a journalist he goes into antifa territory it's scary they're throwing Molotov cocktails you know what could they possibly be saying on the other end of the line how like did you actually read a book like what are they saying quite of course they haven't read a book I got lots of private DMS saying I read the book too it's great I don't know what the fuss is about but uh one one of the tricks is a word trick because it's antifa if you're Auntie antifa they assume then they're brilliant maths that you must be profile and and so and one of this is one of the things one of the taxes they do is they come after you online because that's how they can get you so they build this all this detailer so they change your Wikipedia page so that night they were they were saying we changed it from Winston Marshall as a musician to Winston Marshall is a fascist and my friend who can access Wikipedia with trying to get rid of it and she spent the night and they kept changing it back and it was just a it was basically 48 Hours of this kind of online War where they're trying to eviscerate your entire online life whatever that is which then is your real life so um I think that's part of the problem um I think that there's a con as an idea that even if they accept yeah antifa are doing violent things they accept it as good because if they're fighting Nazis they are justified in doing it the problem is there aren't they aren't fighting Nazis yeah um and the problem is they're burning down Federal buildings but they if they conceive of the state as a fascist state which is why they keep having to say people like Trump at fascists because it justifies their behavior so I think that's another one of the the Dynamics to play yeah oh it's an absolute trick and it's one of the things that has been stunning to us in America and I think a lot of people in the UK don't understand this when the media jumps and they pretend that January 6th was a day of terrorism we literally had people that were burning churches police princip police precincts to the ground it was never called terrorism it was called Justified Violence yeah understandable upset understandable anger and real people's lives and businesses were destroyed in the chaos of BLM and antifa who are literally masked thugs unidentified um and not only that you have a celebrity culture in America where they say We'll bail you out so people we actually had two people that through a Molotov cocktail into a police cruiser in New York City these were Yale graduates right and they were doing this because you had a celebrity culture but I was pretending that this wasn't violence and it was it was so weird in New York as well because in New York which is and I used to live in New York and so I have many friends there that's where a lot of the right there's a deep riots happening and if you go to downtown New York they were they were putting up uh plywood and all the shop fronts to protect them my my friends they're described going for walks with their baby and the child with an upturned police car in the middle of Lafayette Street and um they watched as the Dwayne Reed on Lafayette uh was attempt they tried to burn it down and yeah a lot of the people living there will kind of somehow block like didn't see that and I don't quite understand they or they saw it and blocked it out in their mind because immediately yeah it was maybe you told them it was fun it is cognitive dissonance and it's like this is what we deserve this is what should be happening yeah that's such a good point that if they saw it they're like yeah this is the right thing this isn't even this isn't touched the injustices that have been going on right this is they don't see it as domestic terrorism which and then they see oh you know Grandma in a capital building it's not supposed to be there and they're like that is domestic terrorism and rightfully as you're saying we have to call out extremism whether it's on the right or whether it's on the left that's the key as well actually because um coming out of that situation so we'll go maybe into the the story of what happened next but um it would have been very easy for me to just come out and go look at all the lefties but one thing I do find a little bit frustrating is that let's say Fox News will often cry out antifa but they do the same thing in Reverse of CNN whether it's CNN don't talk about NT for such things so I think it's important to find the middleware let's say that you're both there's problems on both sides here and that that voice I I'd like to hear more of from America but perhaps that's a side point no that's it it's exactly right and I think that's where you were coming from and you didn't even say that you just said good book and now people are calling you what happens next", "eWFvQYHkL_k": "did you know that kovid is still going on you know for like the state the state is still pretending that covet is a thing because obviously they've taken trillions of dollars of taxpayer dollars and laundered it in some capacity so they of course go out to the state-run propagandists operation Mockingbird people and they tell them hey don't forget about covid even though clearly people don't care about it anymore people now realize it was a scam we have to play the part as if it's still a concern every once in a blue moon just sprinkle in a little coveted magic and of course we could hardly talk about state-run propaganders without speaking of Our Ladies over at the view who are promoting the third booster the third booster stores I mean four in total yeah four shots in total in case you lost count or if you're like me and didn't get any so it wasn't relevant here they are reminding you guys to get your third booster unfortunately Whoopi is out with covid so rest up and get back here miss when you feel better it's coming back it's coming back another friend of mine got it too I mean we have to be careful again and it's interesting because a lot of people aren't getting that new booster with a different variety I got mine that one is I I got it a couple months ago and I did get a reaction to it but it made me is everybody eligible for now we have to yes clap if you had your third booster it's worth it you gotta love that clap if you've had your third booster okay clap if you had zero coveted shots yay go Candace I don't know how I'm still alive by the way it's a Bubonic plague and somehow I survived it kept hanging out with my family never wore them out I don't know how I did it I must just have just an incredibly strong immune system or something or we were all lied to in scammed and they're trying to keep it up by the way I love that home chick makes the comment quietly she's like I kind of had a little bit of a reaction they just keep talking over her because I'm about to say that there was ever a reaction to covid shots no no it is safe and it is effective we don't know what it is effective at exactly we they we just keep adding booster shots and we don't know what perspective against because Whoopi has once he is once again out with covid and she's had her boosters so you would think that this story doesn't make sense for them you would think they would say maybe we shouldn't be promoting the vaccine right after we tell them that the person who's been triple quadruple backs is out again with covid but now these ladies don't think too hard they're doing their part sponsored by Pfizer I believe that was uh a true thing during the covid lockdowns we learned that Pfizer was giving money to a ton of journalists so that's what I mean when I say state run journalism now what's incredible by the way is that the White House is keeping up this charade that's not the incredible part but when they post these sort of reminders on Instagram to get your booster or to get your vaccine the comments you guys they are incredible go pursue them go actually read the comments every time the White House posts anything I mean it's a bunch of people telling them to f off that they'll never get another shot that they lied Quantum scam artists I mean the comments are essentially 99.9 percent of people telling the White House and bauchi and everyone and Pfizer that they're a bunch of frauds and the point one percent of people that disagree are on The View so there you go all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus as you guys know I can answer your questions but I only do it on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on Nick Cannon's many many children so if you are not a member yet go ahead and

whenever i go on twitter it's it's like the most insane thing because so can you just kind of explain for people that are not aware of what keeps happening to your house so we've been swatted eight times this year it started on january 6th the day after we hosted marjory taylor green what the first thing that happens is we're recording our show we do it live we film live and then all of a sudden the door to the studio pops open which is to my right side and i see a bunch of cops there's a couple cops and i'm like what is going on and the cops waving like come over here and i'm like this camera's on you know what's going on and so the cop walks through the room does a sweep and then ends up leaving and then we're all confused as to what just happened then we got confirmation from our crew downstairs that we were swatted so swatting is when someone calls the police claiming they're at your house or place of usually usually your house and they'll say something crazy like i'm armed and i i've killed i'll kill again so the police react they show up we had i think uh three or four different agencies we had i believe eight or so different officers all around the properties sweeping through that started and then uh january 6 was the first time it happened then i think about a week later we got swatted again which was the same thing this time they made a bunch of wild claims the police show up once again now they kind of are aware of what's going on so uh we're now at eight but they've also started targeting this is my studio which it is a house but it's like a work studio they started targeting my private targeting my private residence and it escalated to uh recently was our eighth swatting a lot of people seem to think this means the cops are kicking our door in every time no it means the cops show up and they're like hey guys how's it going yep someone called in a bomb threat or a murder or something again and we're like those crazy kids they're expecting they're expecting it now so this is very strange like so first off the first time happens it's terrifying because the idea is that they think someone's dying in there they can just bang in the door potentially shoot everybody and make a mistake we got we got lucky yeah how come they haven't been able to find out who it is that's what i'm interested in well there's i think they might know but building a case might take time and they want to make sure they're doing it right my understanding my understanding is i'm pretty sure the feds are involved because we also had the bomb squad show up and so this wasn't a swatting but something occurred where all of a sudden two bomb squad vehicles show up and there's feds and we have to like back off and they're they're like don't talk about this and put it on the internet and i'm like the bomb squad's here uh but i'm not gonna film it and show it because there's security stuff but i'm also just like there there's uh uh i suppose the issue is if this was any other news outlet any other personality especially if it was establishment press it'd be it'd be front page right a journalist getting swatted the police are showing up why are they targeting him and i'm like i'm not gonna let people just do this and act like you know we shouldn't care about it the first time it happened though uh probably would have been really really bad but right as the police were pulling up our cto was walking through the parking lot and the police pulled up put the spotlight on him told him put his hands in the air no don't move if he wasn't there they would have stormed the studio yeah so why are they targeting you that's a good that's a good place to start here why suddenly your podcast gets really big yeah what are you saying why do people want you to be swatted i don't know uh we call out the media for lying all the time we you know we hosted marjory taylor green on january 5th the next day we get swatted the first time yeah may have something to do with that we're not uh they try and call us right wing or far right but we have a mixed bag i mean ian our co-host is kind of a crazy guy who's not conservative at all and so i'm wondering if the real issue is we don't do things that are bannable so we ca they can't target us by flagging us to get us removed but we're hosting people like alex jones and steve bannon marjorie taylor green among many other people you're not allowed to talk to them and and those people are supposed to be silenced on social media so here we have a a vehicle that gets bannon and alex jones to talk about their ideas in a way that violates no rules how do you stop that swat swat us eight times in one year but it doesn't work i mean we're at the they have gone after my personal house which is the craziest we've had 15 guys show up with short barrel rifles but i'm working i'm like no one's at my house it's like an empty house the cops show up confused and leave right i suppose they're trying to silence us but at a certain point the cops just know us and then wave and say we're here for the sweep oh okay and here's what happened and it gives you information inflation is out of control and what does it look like it looks like paying 47 percent more for fuel than you did a year ago looks like paying 41 percent more for the same used vehicle if you purchased it this year

right now to learn more hello and welcome every time I'm at home and I'm ranting about a headline and going why is the left doing this my husband says the same thing he says it's because they're a death cults I've never actually paused to try to understand why he says that over and over again in fact I assume that he's making some weird Star Wars analogy my husband like most husbands love Star Wars he thinks it's one of the greatest films and I not so much I'm gonna leave it at that I'm gonna be a diplomat about the Star Wars movies so he said this again last weekend when I was ranting about something he said the left is a death pulse and I finally asked him to explain what he meant and and I was surprised by his response right now in this country it's difficult to make comprehensive sense of the left's Mania it's like their social pyromaniacs they're starting fires everywhere for no reason just to watch everything burn gender burn it down nope nope men could be women women can be men it can't exist masculinity oh that's toxic we can't have any more masculinity that's bad Burn It Down climate change we're all going to be dead in 10 years for AOC has become a pathology no matter what happens it's climate change climate change climate change and there's body positivity and fat acceptance if you're on Instagram you know what I'm talking about now they are pushing that there needs to be more acceptance for clinical obesity I'm not talking about a couple of extra pounds I'm talking about clinical obesity if you don't like that if you don't want to see that on the cover of magazines well that's your fault even more radically abortion they want that now to be secured at nine months in the womb they're calling that Progressive well think about that let's revisit those topics in the context of a death cult ready lgbtq the depth of gender and masculinity telling children they can pick their genders what is that going to lead to what's going to lead to families that can't reproduce right same-sex marriages can't productively reproduce we were telling men to be women and women to be men you're destroying the nuclear family think about climate change in that same context what do they say over and over again there's not going to be a planet in 10 years it would be irresponsible for you to start a family actually most bizarre headline I think of the week was me learning that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are going to receive an award from some Progressive charity because they've agreed to only have two children think of that they're going to get an award for not having a larger family fat acceptance but what is fat what is clinical obesity it is the number one killer in America today heart disease that comes from obesity and yet they promote it they want to put it on covers of magazines they want to glamorize clinical obesity abortion self-explanatory my husband was right to be a leftist means to commit yourself to an obsession with death Democrat leadership is committed to a different kind of death they are committed to the death of our society they are committed to the death of individualism and they are ultimately committed to the death to Freedom we know this because Karl Marx wrote the book on it and it seems now the Democrats in this country are performing a play on it what they are after is obviously a totalitarian state to put it in Star Wars terms unlimited power Karl Marx describes socialism as the transitory State between a capitalist society and a communist one and we know that communism has been a long march of death and destruction leftism when someone commits to it is nothing but a long march of death and destruction that's the bad news the question now is is there any hope I know a lot of people wake up and they feel hopeless it feels like every day we are losing more and more of our country well there is at least one quote that I Love from the Star Wars movies and this is it we are the very last of the resistance but we are not alone in every corner of the Galaxy the downtrodden and the oppressed know our symbol and they put their hope in it that's powerful because I believe it to be true today of America I believe that all across the world the Dow trodden and the oppressed are putting their faith in our country they are looking to America to see what happens we saw this over the weekends of course the protests that are erupting in Cuba right now the protesters begging for their freedom are waving the American flag a symbol of Hope so what do we have to do we have to keep fighting because it matters it matters that we remain hopeful every single day that's why I fight why do you thanks for joining me on this episode of canvas if you liked this video subscribe to

we have to talk about first is obviously the very slow shredding of the constitution that has been happening uh since biden has been inaugurated i read the constitution it said this thing about congress passing laws and we elect the you know elect people to congress and this was the process in a democratic republic but then the biden administration figured out unelected bureaucrats there's nothing in the constitution about that so we'll just make them dictators they'll make laws and everyone will have to abide by them and now osha has made a law and every company with employees more than 100 employees and they're looking at expanding even that has to mandate that their employees get vaccinated and if they don't get vaccinated submit to weekly testing and even if you do weekly testing you still have to wear a mask so i don't know if he's ever read the constitution i don't think he really cares um it has been one of the craziest things to see him do this over and over again

seen organizations that have adopted vaccination requirements increased their vaccination rates by more than 20 percentage points often as high as 90 over 90 percent this is good for the workers for their colleagues for their loved ones and for their communities it's also good for the economy of course he's like he's like you know vaccination rates are going up yes because you're holding a figurative gun to people's head and saying that they're going to lose their jobs if they do not comply he's like tyranny works tyranny works what do you guys think i would love to live on whatever planet our president is living on widespread public support are you kidding me i have never seen so many americans stand up for individual rights that i'm seeing right now with these insane mandates this do not comply movement is so powerful and i love to see it yeah i mean he sounds like you know a gaslighting abusive spouse oh she likes being held in the kitchen against her will you know everyone agrees right it's like have you seen your own poll numbers sir no one agrees with this probably not exactly you probably wouldn't understand them but this is uh like you said unconstitutional and you know the administrative state congress passes laws and they leave it somewhat open so that the administrative state can fill in the void with regulations but those are kind of nipping around the edges oh this much carbon output or this not forcing people to get injected against their will and firing if they don't and it and if you don't comply with that you get a q-tip shoved up your nose

instantly at least in circuit five district courts came back immediately i mean within 48 hours and said absolutely not issued a stay and said this is not okay this needs to be reviewed actually the binding administration i think has until today to respond uh to this day and it is interesting to see it because you just don't understand um how he keeps pretending that what he's doing is okay and especially when you waited against four years of everyone saying that trump was an evil dictator you know trump was going to take all of this power you weren't going to be able to have a life because trump was literally hitler as they like to say and then you see what they're doing here and i do believe that when republicans get power back the only answer to this is we need to abolish so many of these bureaucracies that the government has created for itself the cdc goodbye osha goodbye i mean who are these people we've allowed big government to thrive unfortunately and frankly we've been sleeping on the job as americans and protecting our own individual rights under the united states constitution that used to be taught in schools as the law of the land i'm not even sure they're teaching the constitution racism in school anymore because it's racist and it's outdated what's so phenomenal shocking to me though is that i have a background in the biomedical sciences that's what my educational training is in and they're hiding behind this very shallow thin facade of science to justify all of these insane mandates yet they refuse to even look at the scientific data as it's coming out anyway screw whatever the scientists are saying is what the mindset of our politicians are when it comes to implementing these mandates you have to wear a mask if you're not vaccinated but vaccinated people can spread covid19 and there's no problems associated with that if you don't get vaccinated you're anti-science but what about the fact that the vaccines efficacy plummets after about six months the cdc was who told us that this week so there's so many competing narratives here and it's all being used to justify big government overlording you your individual rights your family your workplace your school and changing your life forever absolutely they won't even talk about natural immunity forget it no exactly and and that is the science massive studies over in israel natural immunity is 10 to 20 times stronger at preventing infection from kovit i will say this you know there's a huge difference between living under a democrat administration or republican administration you know when a republican is in power your gas prices are lower your food is affordable the shelves are stocked and you're generally kept safe in your home when a democrat is in power everything goes to hell the borders being flooded you have to get injected against your will i mean it's like they just won't leave us alone but i will say this what we just saw in virginia is the uprising of the grassroots and it's especially from the parents from the parents and i will say this you think parents are upset that crt is in the schools wait till their little kids start having heart attacks right and you're hearing about this over and over again there's been more heart attacks young healthy athletes dropping you know dead from heart attacks it's really bizarre i mean i looked at an entire thread the other day talking about the incidence of heart attacks that has gone up in young healthy adults but don't even talk about that don't even talk about any science about that that's just it's just happening out of thin air they're just overwhelmed these healthy athletes i suppose um well this seems like a really good time for an update i'm still unvaccinated um and me too okay actually all three of us all three of us wow crazy and lucky for me because this could be very scary obviously daily wire has more than 100 employees um the daily wire took one of the biggest earliest stances against this and sued the biden administration which is awesome so proud this is jeremy boring it's done daily wires officially filed a lawsuit against the bind administration to challenge this tyrannical vaccine mandate they did this just for me i like to think um it's all for me it's all for me um but we will not comply and i think that this speaks to the fact that even

recent episode uh yes i have seen this and i would imagine that we probably have a clip of that that we can we can all watch together my next guest is here to address the voting rights bill which would make it easier for minorities to vote and harder for white people in florida to vote twice please welcome my one black friend candace owens martin luther king would have voted for trump hello to you too laura liberals try to make everything about race to quote the only words that martin luther king ever said i have a dream that's it end of quote nothing about money or jobs or schools unless you count as tombstone which says great job gang racism over i hope people at home are writing this down thanks laura now it's my greatest honor to continue to fight for african americans no matter how many times they ask me to stop thank you thank you candace you know first and foremost i was just like i feel you could pick somebody that looks a little bit more like me but um to me it's interesting to kind of consider what's happening here is first i don't know why the depiction is of candace owens being stupid so you have a black woman that's willing to portray another black woman um in a stereotype that were stupid and uninformed and that were puppets um you know to white americans the great irony being that the saturday night live riders is a predominantly white writing crew um this which means that this is directly something that a bunch of white people sat around in a room and decided to write uh mocking black people that that ordained the thing for themselves so i think it's sad for the actress i don't know who she is but i think it's sad for the actress that for a small paycheck she would do that um i certainly wouldn't i would not you know mock somebody thinking for themselves or especially portraying them as if they're just monkey stupid which is uh what this clip was meant to be a portrayal of that said i always say that comedy even though that none of that is funny to me is a protected space so you won't hear me uh screaming young about it i'm not easily offended but i hope that that actress is able to re-examine you know who she is representing poorly and why she is doing that and who is giving her those marching orders right now inflation is at a 40-year high and it is here to stay because here's the government's very little

answer time you guys provide the questions from back at home and i provide the answers so let's dive right into it question number one how should i respond when people say that abortion is necessary for miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy care um pretty simple answer here dana you should respond by telling them that they're just plainly wrong it's this is some weird conspiracy or propaganda that's gotten out i think from the left and they believe that an ectopic pregnancy is treated by an abortion it's not or that a miscarriage is treated by an abortion it's not obviously a miscarriage is when your body you know naturally lets go of the pregnancy and you can actually debunk this by giving them planned parenthood links right on the planned parenthood website it says plainly that the procedure to take care of an ectopic pregnancy is not an abortion so again you just have to kind of conquer the fiction with the facts next question can people be christian or catholic and be pro-choice can people be christian and catholic and worship satan can people be christian and catholic and not believe in jesus christ uh the answer is obviously no i find it super bizarre that there are people that believe that these two ideas can come together that these two ideologies can come together no obviously um the bible is is pro-life and it's not it would never ever ever celebrate the sacrifice of children nine months in the womb in order to support a woman who just wants to go further in her career or whatever the personal reasons may be they're in complete conflict with one another as are many of the things that we're seeing today and people somehow think i'm a christian but i'm a christian but no you're either a christian or you're not a christian and if you're not a christian then say that but don't think that you can somehow balance these two things together abortion is antithetical to the bible next question how to deal with people saying that quote banning abortions will only ban safe abortions end quote this is the myth of the back alley abortions which is something that again if you visit the planned parenthood website you will find has been debunked there's some weird idea out there that women tens of thousands of them were dying per year because they were having using coat hangers to try to self-abort babies from their womb and that just isn't the case at all even the washington post has done a piece debunking this so you can research it whether it's left or right media the truth is that and this is according to the planned parenthood website in 1965 before so that's before the passing of of roe v wade there were approximately 193 deaths that were attributable to abortion and of those 193 deaths 70 of them were performed by physicians so they're far from being a back alley abortion that involved a coat hanger uh the majority of them were from being were being done by physicians so this again is just a huge myth and i believe that his origins were in a propaganda campaign against the catholic church when aboard the abortion issue was obviously waging in the united states and they said we're just going to say that tens of thousands of women are dying in back alley abortions if you use those numbers that means approximately 1965 58 women died not seeing a doctor having an abortion i do not see how any person can look you in the face and tell you that 58 women dying because they wanted to get abortions and maybe went through dire measures to get one justifies the slaughter of approximately 890 000 babies per year which is what we have today it's just nonsensical all right guys it's time to take a break and talk about something i use on my computer and personal devices every single day and that is expressvpn every time you connect to an unencrypted network think in cafes hotels airports your online data is not secured any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data but expressvpn creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so they can't would basically take a hacker with a super computer over a billion years to get past expressvpn's encryption especially fan works on all of your devices phone laptop tablet even on your smart tv and it's so easy to use just fire up the app and click one button and then you're protected this has been a game changer for me personally because i can finally have some peace of mind that my information is not being stolen by big tech you can get an extra three months of expressvpn free at expressvpn.com candace that's expressvpn.com candice expressvpn.com candace all right next question i am pro-life for the most part but i don't think a woman should be forced to give birth to a baby that was conceived through rape or incest could you share your thoughts on that first and foremost my thoughts on this is that what you will find is that when people cannot reasonably come up with an argument when they can't rationally come up with an argument they pursue extremes right so an extreme is 99 of abortions are taking place because people just don't want to be inconvenienced by a baby but less than one percent of people are being raped and are becoming pregnant and i'm gonna use that less than one percent thing that that thing that basically never happens because i don't want to talk about the other 99 and it drives me crazy we know obviously there's never going to be a perfect law there's always going to be extreme circumstances um and unfortunate circumstances like what you're talking about in terms of incest and rape um but regarding either of them and particularly rape you have to ask yourself this question do you believe that a child should suffer because of the sins of their father because that's what we're talking about when you say that a child a sentient being that we know how drastic the procedure of abortion is we know that they are being poisoned that when they are taken out they are being ripped limbed from limb these babies can feel they have feelings um and do do you believe that that baby is worthy of that because of the sins of its father so i'm just going to answer that question by asking you a question back and letting you think on it next question i need a way to respond to the argument you can't be pro-gun and pro-life i think the best way to respond to that argument is by handing them a constitution i mean i haven't even understood the conflation of the gun debate and the pro-life debate it makes entirely no sense uh how can you say you're not pro-life because you believe that people should be able to defend themselves in circumstances against actual predators what what does the killing of an innocent life in the womb have anything to do with if somebody breaks into my home and i grab a gun and i shoot them i mean it's just it's it's it's complete garbage and it's nonsense and we're seeing so much of this rhetoric that's coming out of a left but it's just nonsensical uh you're protecting the lives of your family actually in both circumstances guns are for people to defend themselves and being pro-life is so that we can defend the lives of children and as i said this entire episode the lives of the women that are destroyed physically and spiritually by abortions as well

not drinking because the drinking age is 21. um I hate to say this but I had my first bit of alcohol when I was 13 turning 14 not proud of that I'm just telling you guys the truth here uh what the point I'm making with that truth though is that underage drinking happens from the time people are really in high school is what I would say most people begin to drink and I'm not saying that that's the that we should then lower the drinking age to 13 because people are doing it but I am saying that 21 feels a little late to me especially because kids are in college and we know the kind of

don't know people in the political sphere know this but when i was in high school i went through what was classified as a hate crime uh and i talked about that in the book what happened uh you know who the perpetrators were um and how the media sort of when i was in high school took a narrative away from me because they were just like this is perfect we have a politician's son called her the n-word uh and uh we can stick a label of her as uh you know as a victim and this person um as a racist and very young people involved 14 years old 14 years old being called the racist me being called the victim before i really decide on who i wanted to be in life um and so i got to you know experience what it's like what is what does it feel like being a victim what do you earn um from being a victim we've all been victimized i could mine your life and tell you you've been a victim before i've been a victim before various things very you know it doesn't necessarily need to be about it doesn't need to be about racism about anything you can be a victim but what is it about staying a victim is what the left is after right like being this is like what the ultimate achievement like this is it you've achieved the elixir of life be a victim that is so harmful and so cancerous to people uh we are human beings are meant to triumph we're meant to get over things it actually makes you

years old he's never once complained never once told me i can't do something because of the color of my skin i think it's insulting to his legacy uh for for me to live in this america to run around saying that i'm a victim so i really really do credit you know my grandfather and the experiences that he championed my grandmother and the experiences that she championed when there actually was

saying i refused to teach this material and created some real issues from the inside out uh they would help they'd be able to lock arms a lot of these parents who are feeling the exact same way i i do think we are going to we are at the forefront and on the brink of an educational revolution i believe that i think for the first time people are seeing the public school system for what it is and if

hand i spent some time this weekend and finally got around to watching the britney spears documentary it's called framing britney spears you might have heard about it you might have seen it there's definitely been a movement that has launched because of it called free britney i watched the documentary and i was appalled and i was shocked i felt so incredibly sad for britney spears i really did documentary kind of goes back and it shows you how while she was very young she was manipulated in front of cameras because people wanted clicks they made revenue off of her uh they attempted to essentially draw blood from her to make her upset and to make her cry particularly there was one interview that is given by diane sawyer where the entire purpose of the interview is to make britney spears sad to make her cry it works she makes britney spears break down into tears as she tells her that there's a parent out in the world that wishes she could shoot britney spears she asked so how does that make you feel to know that there are people that just want to shoot you the idea was you're such a disgusting display of what it means to be a woman that there are people in the world who just wish you were dead and britney spears a very young vulnerable girl at this time her career started when she was a young teenager bursts into tears and says that that makes me very sad and diane sawyer looks at her stoney face she looks at her and looks like she's content knowing that she had fulfilled her duty to break britney spears it wasn't just diane sawyer who participated in this it was all of society they wanted to see her have a mental spiral people loved it of course i was very young during this time i'm eight years younger than britney spears and i looked at this documentary i thought to myself where were the adults in the room why did adults allow this to happen why didn't adults say something why didn't someone sit up and say hey what you're doing here is really wrong diane sawyer what you're doing here is really wrong tabloids you're trying to break the spirit of a young girl many can argue that they were successful in breaking her spirit which leads me to chrissy teigen if you've been following me on social media over the last week you have seen that i have led an effective campaign for people to examine the long history of abuse that chrissy teigen has enacted against young women i'm not talking about mean tweets i don't want this to get mixed up people to go oh well people have to toughen up it's mean tweets no i am talking about chrissy teigen's pointed harassment and attempt to convince young teenagers to commit suicide i'm talking about suicide i'm asking the question how is it possible that for so long she has attacked young women young women like courtney stodden if you don't remember courtney assad and courtney stodden was a 16 year old girl who married a 51 year old girl and became a 51 year old man pardon and became a celebrity virtually overnight because she was effectively being groomed and the cameras couldn't look away and during that time chrissy teigen then approximately 26 or 27 years old an adult woman who was eating an a-list celebrity engaged to an a-list celebrity slid into her dms and told her she should just commit suicide she she publicly said the same by the way she publicly said to courtney sodden via tweet that she fantasizes about her being dead she fantasizes about her being six feet in the ground she called it a dirt nap this was fine for years courtney saudin has been speaking out saying that this woman while i was young and vulnerable tried to convince me to kill myself and it turns out courtney saudi wasn't the only one she also did this to lindsay lohan mocking 2009 lindsay lohan had a real suicide attempt she slit her own wrists christy tegan thought that was funny she told her she likely slits her wrists some more every time she sees emma stone another a-list red-headed actress i guess that's funny mocking the attempted suicide of a young woman it goes on and on she told sarah palin that she should shoot herself in the face this has been allowed i don't know why it's been allowed because apparently there there have been no adults in the room so i challenged myself now i can't go back for brittany but i challenge myself now to be the adult in the room and to speak out and to say this is unacceptable we're not talking about bullying we're not talking about cancer culture what i'm calling for is accountability culture i'm calling for consequence culture i'm calling for a time where it's no longer acceptable to just be an a-list celebrity and be allowed to get away with everything for too long being a celebrity has meant never having to say you're sorry not

you plan to start anything new this year with your son you're gonna hate me for saying this angela um but christmas is just not my favorite holiday i said this uh last week thanksgiving has always been my favorite holiday i'm big into thanksgiving traditions i'm big into going around the table and saying what you're most grateful for for the last year christmas i just think gets ruined by the gift giving a bit and i think it sort of really takes away um from the story of christ which i've never really liked and there's so much pressure surrounding the holidays so i've never really had a christmas thanksgiving but i was just saying to my husband the other day that i'm kind of looking forward to establishing those traditions since i have a son who's 10 months old through his eyes the magic of christmas i think for kids is something that's so special and i think that as a first-time parent i'll be able to experience in a new way that will make me want to establish traditions um i do like actually here's one thing i actually do my husband and i uh go out and we pick um christmas ornaments that have something to do with the last year so if we last year for example like we moved houses twice so i got him like a house christmas ornament and a little suitcase ornament and a little um airplane ornament so we exchanged the ornaments and we say why we picked that particular one for the last year um and he got me one with like a fat little mama on it because i was pregnant so so that's one tradition that i do keep for christmas but it's not my favorite holiday yet do you want

her uh so i think that she is um very obviously going to be found guilty i think that they want this jeffrey epstein story to go away and they kind of need to mountain up mount it on some person it's gotten obviously way too much public exposure um with princes being involved and and bill gates being involved how people were on that flight manifest and they sort of need to give the media a reason to put it to bed this is not an acceptable reason to put it to bed if she is convicted and she is found guilty that should actually be the beginning of the story and there should be many more questions asked but i think that they have found their person to hang the guilty verdict on and they are going to try to satisfy the public with that guilty verdict and that will be there will be no more mention of it after she is found guilty thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new

been firm on this from the very beginning amber heard is at fault it has been absolutely ridiculous to see what that woman was allowed to do because she just flew under the radar of the metoo movement there was more than enough evidence to convict her from the very beginning of being an extremely abusive partner she is every bit the example of what i refer to when i refer to toxic feminism she is a woman that treated a man horribly abused him did disgusting things to him as witnessed by multiple people and the first indication that something was shady there was that he was married for such a long time before and his ex-wife came to his defense his children came to his offense every single person that's known him there's no there's no incentive for an ex-wife to come to your defense to say that you've never despite having a divorce um that played out in the public uh ever laid a hand her even suddenly you get amber heard who looks unstable when you look at her saying that you did all these things this man lost his entire career based on an allegation absent a shred of evidence it's everything that i say is wrong with the metoo movement it is emblematic of the idea that women should just magically be believed i don't believe women i don't believe men i believe facts and i believe that they are on johnny depp's side we all know that inflation is out of control but the one place that we are seeing it most especially is in the grocery store the prices for me are absolutely insane unless you are a good rancher's customer because even though grocery prices feel like they've doubled good ranchers prices have stayed low and affordable once you subscribe your price will never go up that means they lock you in for life at whatever price no matter what the markets or what the inflation is doing you're locked in at good ranchers for life at whatever price you sign up for and they only source and sell 100 american meat from local farms and ranches their beef is prime and upper choice the two highest grades possible they have signature steak burgers and wagyu burgers that are packed full of flavor and their pre-trimmed and pre-marinated chicken breasts are absolutely delicious take it from me and very very very easy to prepare they're better than organic meaning that they are completely antibiotic free prices for beef are only going to get higher as summer approaches and your favorite cuts will be harder to find lock in your price and supply with good ranchers right now go to goodwrenchers.com canis to save on the quality that you've been looking for don't forget to use my code candace and enjoy your box of 100 american meat and your 30 savings you don't buy the meat in your house tell the person who does to check out good ranchers american meat delivered next question what are your thoughts on the buses of immigrants going from texas to dc i think that it should be expanded uh dc is obviously not where biden lives he's always in delaware send them to delaware send them to martha's vineyard send them to every single place everywhere that democrats like to vacation if you want a real awakening imagine what would happen if they were sent to martha's vineyard right it would be absolutely they would just tear down the place and say absolutely not and they would put a standstill to everything that biden is doing and i think that i hope actually that more states develop the same mentality because it's not just like they're coming over the border it's also all of these cities that they're becoming situated and people are seeing them line up everywhere and in many in many regards in front of americans so i hope that people see what they did in texas it's a wonderful policy and they expanded across all 50 states because people have to understand exactly what it is that we're complaining about it's so so easy to say well it's not happening near me so it doesn't matter it does matter and until it's on your front

are listening watching he is dating a lawyer from the UK case not the one that was Sensational the one that he won but the one that he lost prior in the United Kingdom and I think it's great why not I mean I will assume that a lawyer is infinitely more stable should be really more stable than Amber Heard and I think for Amber Heard I'm obviously the only way is up for Johnny Depp it's nice to see him back in the dating scene must have been difficult to date entirely after he was so liable throughout the media because of misheard so good to him he has a right to date I hope it works out",

if i'm too scared to even acknowledge the existence of the group of individuals i'm purporting to be defending i probably have no business in the debate say it with me it really is that easy i cannot

one of the main reasons why he's staying these kind of men need carers nine times out of ten day the irresponsible parent and you're the responsible one they need someone to hold them down at home so they can go out and be crazy and do all the things they want to do and then come home to you because they know that you've got their back and they need that grounding I'm not saying that this woman

meeting him on her mom's 50th birthday she said quote it took us two weeks to start dating after that and he basically moved in with me right away it felt good and natural immediately and so now they are yeah getting married and they've cried and they love each other which is amazing you might think okay they don't share any blood right it's not it's not really an issue I'm telling you to pay

called shame month it's absolute debauchery um but you should know that over 200 000 is being spent on drag queen shows at new york city schools why i don't know i am not sure why drag story hour in new york city need needed 46 thousand dollars injected from city contracts for appearances at public schools and street festivals and libraries why that need to happen i don't know maybe it's because it's very obvious that there is an agenda on our children and they keep trying to tell you that you're homophobic if you talk about it but it's not homophobia to talk about the fact that they're going after our children i have said on this show and i have been mocked for it that it's very obvious that pedophilia will be around the corner right there's no reason that we should be seeing images of children putting dollar bills in half naked men that are dressed up as women and seeing adults applaud it around as oh this is love love is love love is love by the way that is one of the dumbest expressions i've ever heard in my love is love air is air air water is water it's stupid debauchery is debauchery and that's what we're looking at right now our society has become increasingly disgusting i spoke about this last week and when when you believe when you start to see that your government is sponsoring that when they're putting real dollars behind things like drag queen story hour in new york city you should realize that something nefarious is going on because the government does not care about your children no the government does not love your children the government does not want your children to be accepted the government wants your children to be enslaved to government for the rest of their life we'll get back to these stories in just a second but first i want to talk to you about expressvpn it's super important to me that my personal data is protected at all times when using the internet every time you connect to an unencrypted network in cafes hotels airports etc your online data is not secured any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data but expressvpn creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so that they can't it would take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past expressvpn's encryption expressvpn works on all your devices phone laptop tablet even on your smart tv and it's so easy to use just fire up the app and click one button to get protected i love it because i can rest assured that i'm never hacked or spied on by big tech get an extra three months of expressvpn free at expressvpn.com candice that's expressvpn.com candace expressvpn.com candace and right now as we're seeing there is a marriage between government and big pharma is my belief that that is the push behind this effort to tell children that they can pick their gender and to confuse them i believe our government is actually sponsoring mental illness i've said this over and over again right because people that are mentally ill cannot stand up on their own two feet right they become codependent with the government they turn to the government for their hormone pills they turn to the government for whatever pills they can to make it feel better right and you are seeing right now that adults are getting behind this narrative so that they can have a woke t-shirt on and say i love my children i i allow my child to pick their gender and pick their species and they feel proud of themselves because they can go and they can say this on facebook if they're a wonderful accepting and loving adult when in reality they are under qualified to have children they should have their children taken away from them because it's child abuse it is child abuse to put a half-naked adult in the room with a small child and having them read a book it's just child abuse that's what it is it's child abuse to ask your ch or your child to take a dollar bill and put it into the thong of a grown adult it's child abuse it's child abuse for teachers to be telling children knowing fully well that it is a lie that they can switch their gender biologically right but to encourage that behind a parent's back that's child abuse so the question remains is when when do parents draw the line and start realizing this start realizing that the scholarships and the nice schools are not worth all of this it's not worth allowing your child to be abused by mentally ill adults thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell

pro-life but for the death penalty I don't think it's ideologically consistent no I am a person that will just not believe that we have the ability to say that somebody should die no matter how horrific the crime and trust me I would very much like for I am I am not sad that pedophiles tend to get killed before they ever even make the trial I'm not sad about that but the idea of sitting up as a judge and saying that this individual should die especially since it's been proving in the past that there have been so many cases where they just got it wrong and they killed someone that's just terrifying to me so um no I think that there are some ideological inconsistencies there", "R9zSCp1ijaY": "next question why have they not released Epstein's list because they're on it duh they're on

department that just did everything they possibly could to not prosecute him when a lone reporter forced them essentially to have to re-examine this they did everything that they could they could uh to cover everything I mean it doesn't make sense that we don't have access that client tell us it just literally does not make any sense it defies logic and the only possible and plausible answer to

right this is something to talk about a lot but I was open to not knowing the whole story people saying he's this he's that he's this about the author saying you're wrong about the the the the movement so I was like well maybe I am like I I'm I'm I of course I'm as possible I've got this wrong I've made plenty of mistakes before why is this a mistake so I um I was open to being wrong and I wanted to protect the band it wasn't their fault it wasn't fair on them that they should be dragged through all of this this Mayhem just because of my opinions so I issued an apology after that point um I really researched everything about this this issue and I slowly and slowly became more and more assured that I hadn't done anything wrong I was right I felt that the the the things said against the author Andy no were lies and they'd said them against me so I was even more like astute to it being nonsense and um and then Andy know the author then got attacked again uh in Portland Oregon and I saw the video and the video came out and my my that really affected my conscience because I I was like well now I'm I'm one I'm on their side I'm on the side who are like accepting this is true so I was in this terrible position because I have this apology which that apology really affected me like the rest of it if the apology hadn't happened I might not have had to leave I don't think because it wouldn't have affected my conscience so I so I got to this point where I was like well if I leave this apology out there as my statement I I'm participating in the lie it's like it's like me saying that that far left extremism is a good thing and um or that it you know even when Biden was in his presidential campaign he said that antifa's just an idea I was like what are you crazy like are you not seeing this footage like all right so I've that really that kind of stuff really bothered me and but then the problem I had was that if I came out of the truth my bandmates would get all of that hell again and that was what were they saying though like because obviously you guys must have been talking about this and you're going guys like you know this person was attacked well I explained to them my my predicament uh when I find I finally came to the conclusion that uh I was right and I hadn't done anything wrong with the book if I'd done something wrong it's that I'd caused a PR disaster for them but disaster bit of a mess um even said that it's not going to be fair on them for uh them to suffer because of my political opinions which would be the case in in the music industry because it's such a small industry and the cage and if you have um uh heterodox uh opinions they they pick up and all you have to kind of keep quiet about them so they didn't make any great objection so I published my letter uh explaining why I I um I left I I had to leave and um and the great thing about doing that as soon as that happened my conscience was cleared it was it was it was amazing thing like in that period it was about three months I'd lost weight I wasn't sleeping I I was going mad like actually a little bit mad because I just felt like reality and and you're being gaslit I've felt like that and I was gaslighting myself as well maybe I am crazy you know exactly so um immediately we're publishing that and quitting I was released from that now it doesn't mean that there's a whole new bunch of troubles that come along you know people say like the truth will set you free yeah but it's also and you'll have this right you speak your mind very confidently and bravely and a lot of people follow you and admire you but you also get a lot of and you get a lot of abuse and so yes you're free in some sense but um I don't I don't know how you feel about that does that that having that sort of scrutiny do you feel free and under that pressure or uh would you well presumably you you would stop doing it if you if you well I think I think the LIE is it's almost like an illness if you know something to be true and you keep your mouth shut it destroys you as a human being I actually think Jordan Peterson talks about that you know if you to say something that you know is not true um it it kills you a little bit right it makes you less of a person yeah and people are it actually is an exchange it's like you're selling your soul right for something else right just to be protected you know so the pr machine doesn't turn against you so that the Press likes you and that's a horrible exchange your soul is is a horrible exchange so I think for me yes is it difficult to tell the truth of course we live in a society that is insisting on the LIE and gaslighting people and making them believe telling them not to believe their own eyes but I think it's I think it's worse to exist under the LIE is my honest belief and I think that's why you were losing weight and not sleeping it's because your soul was like are you are we really doing this are we just gonna pretend that you didn't just see what we saw with our own eyes and it's like yeah well we just gotta do that because society says we have to lie absolutely in in that period there's an essay I was reading this essay I read it about five times by Alexander sultanitz and he published it on the eve of his expulsion from the Soviet Union in 73 74 about that time it's called live not by lies and I urge your listeners viewers to read this essay and there's a paragraph in that essay where he writes I can't remember exactly but it's something like how dare you call yourself an artist or an academic if you are not able to stand by the truth and um and that really affected me because I thought well this apology whatever I do in the future as a musician whatever songs I write whatever prose I write whatever I say is going to be invalidated because I have proved not to be consistent in telling the truth before in my life so I had to write that wrong", "2-XPx2kdrpQ": "next story and it's not a very surprising one not exactly breaking any news here you just have to have you know a capacity to think it turns out that people that are leaving the trans Community are describing the trans Community as cult-like yeah once you leave they want violence they're angry at you how dare you you are doing nothing to justify their narrative that men can be women and women can be men and when people obviously go through the extremes of attempting that feat and then they say uh oh I've got to live in a buyer's remorse you wake up and you say hey I think I want my private parts back and they become vocal and talk about this as abuse because it is abuse Well turns out that people that are still trans turn on them and go oh my God how dare you how dare you pretend that our fantasies aren't real so those individuals who are de-transitioning I don't even like that because you never really did transition but they're being described as the transitioners are saying that they're experiencing death threats and doxing and intimidation and that they're being accused of genocide from cult like from The Cult like transgender community and this should surprise nobody I have said there is no community that is more vicious there was no Lobby that is more vicious than the LBGTQ rstuv wxy and Z Lobby I have seen this myself the way they come at you with a way that is so toxic in fact uh rather notoriously Matt Walsh went through all of these death threats for doing his documentary what is a woman he went through he had to experience all of this and people were fearful for him and his family at that time because he just explored the reality of a trans movement and it makes sense that this is a community to be fearful of because you have to have such a tremendous mental disorder right a very serious mental disorder to do what these individuals are doing right what would make you want to mutilate your own body to make it impossible right for you to potentially have a productive family in the future you have to be so radically transformed by an ideology and you believe in this ideology so much for you to go through with what is really a counts what really we should be calling human experimentation that's what it is it's human experimentation and then when somebody comes to you with some reality of like hey man you actually can't pick your gender of course you're going to become violent you are you are committed to this ideology by any means necessary so yes a bunch of detransitioners as they are known are talking about the online vitriol and the harassment and the death threats that they are receiving and there are now all of these tensions between trans activists and these D transitioners and it really spiked this month at a meeting of Florida's medical board where sex change interventions for children were restricted they were a bunch of insult insults that were being hurled and bomb threats that were posted online because how dare the medical board even talk about this trans rights activists shouted over their opponents at the hearings they call people bigots and said shame on all of you they vowed to dox the board members by publishing their private phone numbers and releasing other details about them online so yeah be very careful tread very carefully if you're going to go out there and say biology is real and that only women can give birth and that men can't be women and women can't be men be very careful out there guys it is getting real there's also a Reddit thread and in the Reddit category if you guys know how Reddit works you can find your community well there is a community that is called d-trans so people can come together and talk to each other about these various issues here is just one example on the d-trans threat on Reddit somebody wrote I'm so bitter the trans Community says that if you detransition and regret what you did to yourself you have no one to blame but you but I was 10 I was 10 years old obese and already looked more like a boy than a girl I despised myself the internet told me that this was the way out gave me tips on hiding from my parents who wanted nothing but for me to not make a huge mistake I'm 17 now my breasts are completely stunted I have a severe eating disorder and I've never had a boyfriend I ruined myself at 10 years old and the community that once encouraged me now turns their backs and ridicules me I am so bitter that's heartbreaking it is heartbreaking and the entire ecosystem that supported this young girl and told her that she should take part in ruining her body and ruining herself they should face prison sentences I honestly believe that people should be in prison for what they are doing to Children it is child abuse in the highest form in fact saying child abuse doesn't even seem to do it justice all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about the Arizona

was virtually impossible for her and Kayla to see each other's computer screens despite the fact that there was only a distance of four or five feet between them so they thought okay these girls were tweeting well it turns out I mean we're cheating it turns out that they weren't actually cheating at all and that they had to have all of these psychologists and behavior Genesis that specialized in the study of twins to testify to clear their names", "RVK5n3EQCpQ": "this show is sponsored by expressvpn it's time to stand up to Big Tech protect your data at expressvpn.com Candace welcome back let's take a moment to talk about one of the largest national stories right now the tragic death of Gabby batito a young travel vlogger who died on a trip with her fiance Brian laundry who's currently a person of interest in her case in response to the wide coverage for Gabby and the ongoing investigation one MSNBC host Joy Reed had a big problem with the case so let's take a listen to what she said and then I will give joy some of the counterpoints and the petito family certainly deserves answers and justice but the way this story has captivated the nation has many wondering why not the same media attention when people of color go missing well the answer actually has a name missing white woman syndrome the term coined by the late and great Gwen Ifill to describe the media and public fascination with missing white women like Lacey Peterson or Natalie Holloway while ignoring cases involving missing people of color okay missing white person syndrome I thought I had heard it all but apparently I had not here we are Joy Counterpoint number one you have three children Joy according to the internet their approximate ages are 28 26 and 23. your youngest is then very close in age to Gabby potito as a mother you then know what it's like to feed bathe nurture and love a child from the moment that you welcome them into the world you heard Gabby patito's mother plea you heard her cry you heard her beg for the safe return of her daughter and you felt nothing presumably because she was white I can only imagine the pain that woman felt when she was informed that her daughter's body had been found dog's body was found cold alone and in a forest 2 000 miles away from home a daughter that she loved every single day for 22 years if your first instinct when you hear that an innocent young girl of an entire life ahead of her was brutally murdered the first instinct is to offer commentary about the color of her skin I want you to know something Joy you're a monster something has gone horribly wrong with you there really is no other way to say it Counterpoint number two your issue is with media coverage of black people that are missing I mean why aren't people of color receiving the same media attention when they go missing you ask well joy this is going to really shock you but you are the media you said this statement on your very own Show on MSNBC so I had my team take a look because surely the person pointing the finger couldn't possibly have three pointing back at them but it turns out joy that you do get as far back as we could look in the last two years at least you haven't brought a single missing black child case to the Forefront now maybe that's good news because it means that you're not just a monster you're also a massive hypocrite Counterpoint and as a final Counterpoint and really this one is more of a question and I'm hoping that you might be able to help me out with if it's called missing white person syndrome when the media dedicates wall-to-wall coverage to a crime that happens to a white person what exactly is it called when the media dedicates wall-to-wall coverage for an entire year to every black person that is killed by a police officer while failing to comply what exactly was it called when every major city burned for weeks because of George Floyd Ahmad arbory Rihanna Taylor Michael Brown take your pick what exactly is it called when entire murals and statues are built up and billions of dollars are raised in their name people all over the world you know it's funny we know so many other names because outside of Gabby potito if press I actually sat down and I thought about it outside of Gabby potito I cannot actually think of the name of a single missing white person that inspired similar wall-to-wall coverage at least not in the last decade try it I did and the best I could come up with was as you mentioned lace C Peterson and that happened in 2002 so you're also dishonest joy every major corporation sports team government agency and celebrity bends over backward each and every time a black person dies in a police shooting whether that shooting is completely Justified or not we know none of the names of white people that die in the same fashion none of them not even one so why don't you cut the crap and give the potato family the respect and the national sympathy that they

"thoughts on Karen Morris I love that Karen Morris claiming that she is hesitant to go to the CMAs because of Brittany Aldean The Truth is that she's not backing out of the CMAs because she is afraid or she doesn't want to see Brittany Aldean The Truth is is that she's apprehensive because now she has been exposed as someone who hates the country music fans to someone who thinks that the way that they vote is insurrectionist he is someone who despises Trump supporters conservatives Republicans and she's been outed as that she's fearful to go because now the fans are aware of how she really

is always telling us that she's fearful for her life and she had an interview with Chris Wallace on CNN and she spoke about how the recent attack on Paul Pelosi has really heightened her concern that they're coming for her I don't know who we don't know who they are or why they're coming from but they are coming for her and take a listen to AOC explain that to you I felt that my life has been in danger since the moment that um I won my primary election in 2018 and it became especially intensified when I was first brought into Congress in 2019. does it mean as you walk down the street as you go about your life that you this is something on your mind that you are looking over your shoulder what does it mean it means when I wake up in the morning I hesitate to walk my dog it means when I come home I have to ask my fiance to come out to where my car is to walk me to just from my car to my front door I mean bottom line is she's talking about how she feels and today's episode is about feelings and not facts So factually speaking nothing has happened to AOC to make her fearful she's not saying that she's gotten a threat she's not saying that any no person has ever approached her and yet despite there being an absence of facts she thinks that she has a right to be super annoying to her dog and her fiance I mean poor dogs like hey can you take me for a walk she's like no I'm scared why are you scared I don't know I just feel like I should be scared and they think of Beyonce could you imagine you're in the house and every single time your fiance gets out of the car they call you and they're like hey could you come walk me 10 feet to the door I'd be like no I don't want to do that every single day well I'm scared what are you scared for nobody knows I don't know why I'm scared I just feel that I should be scared in the same way that I felt that I almost died on January 6 when a bunch of grandmas stormed the Capitol building and I wasn't even in the Capitol building but I felt scared and I felt like I almost died and Ted Cruz almost killed me and she said much said that Ted Cruz Ted Cruz almost killed her somehow nobody really understands but the point is that AOC feels like a victim perpetually she has not yet been able to explicate on that victimhood and we will continue to report on her forever developing story of why She's suffering and you need to realize

I heard when I was coming back from London Trump is back on Twitter this is amazing I was so happy to learn about this that Elon Musk has reinstated Donald Trump's Twitter account namely because uh Donald Trump never tweeted anything violent it is just a made-up narrative people pretended that he tweeted on January 6 March to the Capitol and burn it it never happened right they just decided to shut down his Twitter account and his Facebook account on January 6th because I guess just him existing encourages violence and it just begged a question what is freedom of speech how are you penalizing somebody for something that did not happen on your platform at all how what is the process here there was no process and Elon Musk understood this and he reinstated Donald Trump's account he also reinstated which I am equally maybe even more excited about project Veritas you know we are good friends with James James O'Keefe over at project Veritas they are doing real investigative journalism the government women hates them because they are investigating the government they pointed out the lies that were being told during the covet scams they pointed out the lies of the vaccine manufacturers and their ideas that this vaccine is totally safe and effective and because of that they have been banned from the Twitter platform again never inside any violence they just incited people to take a look at their own government and realize that crimes are being committed and that wasn't allowed under a Jack Dorsey Twitter I guess Elon Musk we would say to them and predictably people had meltdown about this in fact the best part is that this came about because Elon Musk did a poll instead should Trump be reinstated and the majority of people felt that he should be reinstated I think it was 54 of people said yes to it and Sam Harris as just one person who was having a meltdown over this uh tweeted this in response he tweeted Elon Musk if you do bring him back you shouldn't please have a terms of service that covers the deliberate spreading of dangerous lies and then apply it he will be off again within a week the deliberate spreading of dangerous lies it's just spoken like an absolute leftist and he wasn't done because then Trump obviously got reinstated and Sam Harris said this he said the prevailing opinion among quote-unquote Free Speech absolutist appears to be that this platform in order to become healthy must helplessly publish the malicious lies of any Maniac at scale regardless of the consequences good luck with that but such a pretentious tweet from Sam Harris why do I like Sam Harris well a little story if you want to go back in a time machine to 2020 I think it was 2020 when the cold covered stuff happened I instantly knew it was a scam I knew the government was lying I was the most vocal outspoken person with the platform against the coveted lie and I tweeted I don't know what it was I tweeted but Sam Harris hit back I said that well I said eventually we're going to realize I'm paraphrasing myself here that kovid was a lie and Sam Paris tweeted back and said your tweets are going to get people killed and then Dave Rubin who's a mutual friend of us both reached out to me and said please just get on the phone with Sam Harris he's a good guy I don't want you know two of my friends warring you know he tried to play Switzerland in this and so I honored my friendship with Dave Rubin by getting on the phone with Sam Harris and I will never forget the conversation he calls me up and he sounded like he was in a bunker he sounded actually like he had taken his children and his wife down into a bunker with whatever was needed to survive and he said to me you don't understand and he used the fact that of course what they always do well these academics know absolutely nothing but what they read in books they do they do not possess critical thinking skills at all and he said I know doctors and Physicians over in Italy this thing is going to hit America in two weeks there's going to be Gurney's on the street they're going to be gurneys on the street because there's going to be no room in the hospital you don't understand this thing is real he was speaking to me like the Bubonic plague was about to hit America and I was just very calm and respectful I was in the car on my way to an event obviously I was not walking myself at home I was in Texas my husband was next to me and I was just making faces like oh this guy sounds a little cray-cray he has definitely sipped in the Kool-Aid and I just said okay thank you and they start running rattling off some statistics and trying to under make me understand how viruses work because he's got a degree from Stanford University how could some Heroes be wrong and of course hung up the phone said to my husband he's completely out of his mind crazy that man is not coming out from under that bunker for months to speak and I went inside did an event shook everybody's hand and did not get covered until years after that and I survived it never had a vaccine never did anything turns out I was right Sam Harris was wrong but in a Sam Harris type universe I would have had my account suspended for spreading malicious lies because how could I possibly know anything when the experts and the academics are telling us the opposite they read books guys they understand the data they own the science right that's the whole point you spend enough time in school you become an idiot I say it every time he's got a PhD from Stanford which lets me know that he is somebody that believes in his own magic right he believes that he's super educated as these leftists tend to be I'm a journalist so I I am a responsible purveyor of information citizen journalists don't understand we should tell you what's right and what's wrong and in a world where you disallowed other opinions and by the way my expert it was kind of like what I said when I was on the hill I said my expert was being black in America my expertise on the coveted stuff was experience I was going and I was doing my event still I was shaking hands I wasn't wearing a mask I had my family over nobody was dying using anecdotal experience to debunk the idea I mean six feet apart I mean how completely asinine was that works it's why we should have open in communication and we should say I understand what the experts are saying but here's what I am seeing and experiencing in my life oh okay I have covered and it felt like just a very light cold guys but no no no they wanted you believe that it was a Bubonic plague they wanted us all to get on our knees to close our businesses to impoverish our families and Sam Harris by that very metric should have been taken off of Twitter because he spread that dangerous and malicious misinformation makes me happy that these people who were broken by Trump's existence are still unhappy and upset and here you know what Tim you could just leave Twitter that's an option if it's so dangerous why don't you just get off a bit how about that all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily

am I fired what did I do wrong and they tell you well you're white so that's what you did wrong it's 2022 being white sometimes can be a crime a lot of times it can be a crime you just don't have you don't look the part of what we want to see here well that is what Keith Wan is saying happened to him he is 53 years old and he was one of at least two people that were forced off the production by the non-profit theater Development Fund which staffs Broadway shows with American Sign Language interpreters after the group decided that it was quote no longer appropriate to have white interpreters represent black characters for ASL Broadway shows so I guess that would mean he was representing a black character simply because he was signing what the black character was saying and so they decided that he must be fired and we instead much reach in to the ASL black community because that would somehow be more appropriate so obviously they're going to be sued for this actually we do have laws in place that don't allow for that blatant sort of racial discrimination because racial discrimination doesn't just happen one way despite what you've been told by the mainstream media narrative racial discrimination in my honest estimation happens more often than not against white people in this Society thanks to BLM and the operation Mockingbird narrative which told us that being white was a form of evil and we needed to be addressed all the time so in today's society yes we have racism that is operating toward white people and Juan is a victim of this and he has done the right thing by filing a federal discrimination lawsuit on Tuesday against the organization and the director of its accessibility programs Lisa Carling Lisa Carling I don't know what race she is but I do know that she is an absolute idiot and that whatever comes her way is absolutely deserved in terms of his lawsuit I'm expecting him to win Carling told both him and another interpreter whose name was Christina to back out of the show which celebrates its 25th anniversary on Sunday so that they could be replaced by black sign language experts that's according to the suit and the emails which were in fact obtained by the post and verified um Juan as I said he's a sign language interpreter and a performer he's been working in New York for more than a decade was offered the chance in March to work on this amazing show and then just a couple of days later he was shocked when he received the email sheepishly which Carlin sheepishly said hey why don't you just leave the show and what she said in the email he should step away from his job because of the quote-unquote current social climate yeah so that is a real thing we will keep up to date on the story and inform you to see if it gets even dumber but I

give the answers today we have three the first question is is madonna okay absolutely not madonna is not okay madonna is the opposite of okay if you're following her on instagram i think she actually recently got hit with a strike she just can't stop being naked she is going through some very weird mental public spiral and because she's got wealth and money no one will tell her that's around her she surrounds herself with a bunch of yes people so pray for madonna hope she gets the help she needs but know that she is not even okay in the slightest question number two who is the most likely 2024 presidential nominee for the democrat party i'm the only one that thinks this i thought this was the entire reason that they made such a big deal out of him but i think they are priming new york city's mayor eric adams to run they're going to try to run him as like a secondary obama the good news is he's absolutely created a disaster in new york city and everything he promised has not come into fruition so even though he can be likable as a person when he's speaking his disastrous results are in and i think that america is not going to fall for that well he's a black man in the same way that america fell for that in 2008 but i do think that he's going to be a front-runner and potentially that hillary clinton could come back i don't think she ever gives up i think she just keeps coming back and i welcome that there's something about it i like you know i talk about this with my producers it's like hillary clinton uh the woman from the view view what's her name barbara joy behar like they're so crazy and you just have to kind of look at it and enjoy it and be fascinated by it because it's rare and it's it's beautiful last question are you taking applications to replace your assistant savannah always always send me your applications i have fired her six times i don't know why she's still here thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video

now we have a question from a member in our live audience and this question comes from grant who is from washington hey grant hi nice to meet you nice to meet you yeah so i'm 23 years old and i am concerned i've noticed our country has gotten more and more divided as i have grown up and i was wondering if about your thoughts on the national divorce idea that some pundits have suggested the national divorce idea it is interesting up the left says that um half of the nation more than half of the nation rather are terrible horrible bigots white supremacists racists misogynists every iss that you can pop on a word that's exactly what we are according to the left and yet when you talk about saying what if we just split up what if we just put up they freak out they lose their minds right it seems odd it seems almost counter to their narrative we're such horrible backwards people why do they want to stick together with us well because they have to have someone to steal money from first and foremost they're telling all the kids that they don't have to go to work the government will take care of everything well then there's some people that are hard-working americans that believe in conservative principles that they're going to have to steal from going into the future and listen it's a big discussion um but i'm interested in hearing that debate i i think once we get to the part you know where we agree on nothing right right now in america we don't even agree that america is a fundamentally good country we don't even agree that we should stand up for the flag that we should honor our fallen troops right people that come from overseas territories literally in a coffin under a flag standing up and honoring them nope we can't agree with that that's a form of white supremacy we no longer agree on a national anthem right we can't we you can't have it now there's a black national anthem if there is not something that is the glue that keeps everybody together you don't really have a nation right now we are not the united states of america we are the divided states of america um and so it would be an interesting discussion if imagine a place where you know florida texas tennessee um you know oklahoma all came together and said you know what buy keep new york and la have have a good time we'll actually pass the migrants right from the border right into your lands and and you can feed and clothe them into into perpetuity i think it would be a very very interesting debate to have in my personal opinion um but i mean there's nothing wrong with having more of a debate will it happen probably not because the left will fight tooth and nail to keep americans in line [Applause] thanks for joining me on this episode of candace if you wish you could come

so people are not going to be able to connect with her as a what did you want me to what this is how I dress this is actually how I don't have a stylist this is legitimately how I dress so you want me to pretend to be someone I'm not what throw on some uh Fresh Air Force Ones some old school FUBU put big Hoops that have my name in the middle and say yo yo yo up the gate it's not who I am right I made a documentary to expose the truth I'm not going to present a lie while trying to expose others for lying that doesn't make sense I'm not going to present a lie while presenting the truth I I I find a lot of difficulty with this entire concept that when black Americans look presentable they somehow can't connect that's the actually one of the problems I think in Black Culture", "_GGRkvkeMoo": "a bunch of black women that were dressed in neon green part of a gang jumped on to the subway and began to Pummel two 19 year old women at a Time Square subway train stop and they were released without bail on Tuesday but I want to actually have you guys take a look at this video take a listen to this video because it's insane when my producer saw this video she said who was the person recording this right like how could you just allow this to happen and I said in defense of the person recording it I wouldn't know what to make of it I don't think that my brain would be able to process that I was witnessing a crime", "cFwDLdh4J8U": "moving on to another story you guys because I don't know what to make of it a Florida woman is suing after claiming that Velveeta the Velveeta cup you know Velveeta cheese she's saying that it takes longer than ready time to prepare so there is a Velveeta cup that alleges that it takes just three and a half minutes to be ready that's what the box label says at least but Amanda Ramirez which is a woman that lives in Florida is angry and she is suing for five million dollars in a class action lawsuit against Kraft Heinz Foods company and she filed this lawsuit because she says that ready in three and a half minutes is false and misleading because the product takes longer than three and a half minutes to prepare for consumption so she knows because she tried maybe she put and she ate it and she was like this isn't ready yet and she got so angry and she's just so lazy and so fat and so despicable and everything that's wrong with American society that she said rather than just give it an extra 30 seconds she said um I'm gonna I'm gonna sue the company for five million dollars so she didn't have time to wait to waste eat her food but she made time to try to steal five million dollars from a company because she's a despicable human being and it's just such a common Terry I feel on American society like this is this is just a perfect person to be probably a government leech you know a woman that really will take the time out to sue a company right because it takes longer than what they advertise on the box to make it a one that can't even make the time to just make mac and cheese herself and needs to this ready prepared meal and becomes this angry yeah that is a very sad commentary on the state of things in American society all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on Brittany Greiner and my

on Twitter lives of tick tock you know that account phenomenal account and incredible they used to get banned all the time for quite literally just sharing videos of what was happening on Tick Tock um and they've really kind of leaned into wanting parents to understand how aggressive the pornography that is happening in school is as well as this transgenderism which I think is very closely uh very close to the topic of transgenderism is a topic of pornography I think a lot of it is trying to Prime people trying to Prime children for abuse I believe that for sexual abuse it's very strange to me that there's suddenly this hyper focus on children's genitals and their sexual desires it's not right it's strange and you don't you should not allow the media to Gaslight you to believe it's not strange that you're just not woke enough for understanding enough so lives of tick tock recently spoke to a father who confronted his daughter's principal in Oklahoma in the Owasso Oklahoma Public School System about a pornographic book entitled blankets which depicts sex masturbation and a child getting raped you would think good for this father that's absolutely what you should do you should be storming into the schools and you should be saying what is this is unacceptable what are the principal do the principal responded by calling the police and banning the father from school grounds yup that is true the father told them to tick tock that when he asked the principal if she thought that the content in blankets in blankets was okay for children she replied I'm offended by your questions how dare you even ask the question dad and now he's not allowed to pick up his his kids without written permission in fact they even issued a letter to him now so angry that they could even ask the question about the pornographic material they wrote him this letter in the letter reads in light of your actions that took place on the grounds of the district on the evening of October 10 2022. after the board meeting it has been determined that you have committed one or more acts that interfere with the peaceful conduct of activities on District property and your presence interferes with the peaceful conduct of activities on District property therefore pursuant two here's a code in the law you are hereby directed to leave the Owasso Public Schools and all of its grounds including sports venues and not return this prohibition also includes any District activity or field trip not conducted on school property as I have determined that your presence is a threat to the peaceful conduct of students should you fail to leave the school grounds immediately or should you return within six months without first obtaining my written permission to do so the school district will have no alternative but to take such legal action as is necessary to maintain a peaceful educational and work environment as per board policy 1.24 a request for reconsideration may be filed by you so long as it is received by the district within five calendar days of your receipt of this letter sincerely Dr Margaret Coates the superintendent of schools who is a freak absolute freak to allow this graphic book to be something that is attributed to children and the idea that you're going to bully talk about the state just saying actually these are our kids now you're going to bully him you're going to say now you're not even a lot of student grounds because we're not Predators for showing this sexual material which depicts child rate you're a predator for asking why we are showing this material so I'm going to State this again I've stated this many times to parents and I hope that if I saved enough time other parents will start saying it and we'll kind of catch on here Distributing pornographic material to minors is a crime you actually don't have to March into the school you should be marching into your local police station and you should be saying let me tell you superintendent what the code is under the laws okay the actual laws in this city the actual federal laws that we have in this nation okay let me show you what codes and what laws you violated and tell you that actually if no action is taken I am going to file a complaint with police officers we need to start having teachers and we need to start having superintendents that are Distributing this sort of pornographic material to minors arrested until these individuals are arrested there is not going to be a strong enough signal sent to the schools to tell them that we are not going to tolerate this Behavior we should never tolerate this behavior that is what I believe is going to be the action that will make that incredibly clear to them all right guys next portion of the show is going to be

really is allowing for is I always say there are a bunch of people that are operating under the LGB banner and they're these people are sickos and they're Freaks and they but then they say oh but gays and lesbians you often stand up for us we're all the same and it's like no we're not the same right I have same sex attraction you want to mutilate a child you and I are not the same I think it's going to take more lesbian and gay people and bisexual people to stand up and to speak out against this for society normalizes don't allow these freaks to fly under your banner in fact you don't even

here in our live studio audience and i still look forward to answering these questions every week i don't get to see them beforehand so the answers are always going to be raw and unfiltered from me if you're ready we'll get right into it first question is from nathan he asks i love the new show candace my question is what are your thoughts on political parties are they good bad should the system change and if so how i mean that is a really big question i will say that i do not think it is plausible at this moment right now that we're going to change from an essentially two-party system so i like to go with what is possible in the immediate especially uh during a time like we have today in this country where it feels like we're losing this country and if we don't get the right leader in office we may not recognize america it certainly won't be the america that i grew up in so i think in the short term things are not going to change in terms of the two-party political system and i think that that is why we have people that are not actually republicans i've always said i've never really felt that donald trump was a republican i felt that he was kind of disruptive to the process and didn't really matter that he ran as a republican in the end people are going to follow the candidates so i don't think they really matter necessarily and i think donald trump is proof of that next question what is your favorite thing about being a wife and a mother um i don't know there's something so special about starting your own family it's just it's you can't even there's not even enough words in the dictionary to really be able to define what it is but you just feel fulfilled i guess is the best way to say it i think prior to starting my own family prior to getting married you kind of feel like you're running around and you don't know why you're doing what you're doing and life doesn't really make sense um and it's one of the reasons why i always tell young women who are being convinced by toxic feminism not to believe the lies and and to believe that fulfillment can come from something else like your career i think it nothing fulfills your soul more than family and starting your own family just kind of opens your eyes to what life is really about and what's actually important and you know that you get to go home every day and you feel safe in a way so i think it's sort of tethered me to what really matters next question what is your advice to young conservatives who have been censored by their school i was censored after i tried to write a controversial topics speech on black lives matter and the true mission and beliefs of the organization i'm not sure what you mean by you were censored for trying to write it so i'm going to assume that you mean you weren't allowed to write the paper and at that moment i and i have said this over and over again so i will sound like a broken record but i think parents need to provide meaningful support uh to their students i mean i mean to their children especially when they are in school uh because there is sort of a bullying that is going on and is is from top to bottom uh the administrations and the teachers are bullying the students uh into one perspective over the num over the other conservatives in particular are facing a really tough time in the classroom and i know that as a parent if my son uh was actually writing a topic and the topic made sense in terms of what the assignment was and he was told he wasn't allowed to write it because of wrong think i would be in the principal's office the next morning and i think when it becomes really extreme and and it becomes a form of bullying then i think parents do need to sue the administrations you have to remember the majority of these schools are not private they are public schools and we fund those public schools and we do have rights that should be protected as taxpayers next question i think this is the final question and it is from elizabeth in alabama i am a mother who is concerned about sending my child to public school timely because i don't want them to be taught critical race theory amongst other leftist indoctrination curriculum i saw your recent tweet on critical race theory being a form of institutional racism would love to hear more of your thoughts on the topic yes absolutely critical race theory is racist uh you are teaching students the opposite of what we were supposed to be doing following the civil rights era we were supposed to be teaching students that race doesn't matter um and that they are all the same and now actually via critical race theory you are trying to teach children that a certain group of people are oppressed by the way if you're looking for racism that's it if you're watching the show and you look at me and you go oh can this is black and therefore she is oppressed and she needs my help that would make you a racist to look at somebody's skin color and to assign attributes to them is the very definition of racism critical race theory is therefore racist because it is teaching white people to look at and to treat people differently according to the color of their skin and they're trying to pretend that this is going to help america it's not children don't see race in that way when i was growing up we didn't have critical race theory i never looked around the room and said oh my this girl is privileged and i'm oppressed and thought of all of these things because it wasn't being taught to me we were all just treated as the same we were all welcome to the same room we were not trained to see each other as different and so it really is the opposite of martin luther king jr's dream it is martin luther king jr's nightmare where you are assessing people purely on the color of their skin uh to answer the beginning part of your question pull your kids out of any school that is teaching critical race theory i don't want to hear any excuses i hate when people say oh it's so hard it's difficult if your children are being indoctrinated if your children are actually being handed mental poison you cannot in good conscience allow them to stay in school you can't figure it out i don't know if you have to call your sisters your aunts your cousins your next-door neighbors and figure out how you're going to make time to homeschool them or if you're just going to try to school shop and find a different school to put them in you need to make a change to not allow a government that is focused on racist policies because that's what this is this is the reintroduction of segregationist teachings to raise your children do not allow it i hope that i answered that question for you and i hope that in general we have given you something to think about today thank you for joining us we'll see you next week", "V206c4__WTI": "Meghan Markle has been victimized again again no no not that time or the time before over time before that or the time before that the time before that time again into the future the time after that the time just before it and the chime the time three weeks after today where she will also be victimized but this time was about after the fact of the first time Meghan Markle has again been victimized or something so um you remember the interview that she did in the cut magazine where she you're not gonna believe it she actually talked trash with the royal family I know she's never done that before but she did do it in the cut magazine interview and it created a firestorm of press but now she's giving another interview to the interview to basically say that she was a victim of the magazine article even though they quoted what she said she says now that she was just too trusting and open with the writer of that magazine uh where she once again said stuff against the Royal Family", "pJiArhPrvks": "okay so uh this week we have two inmates of a female prison that were impregnated by their transgendered inmate i'm going to guess it was a man i don't know and this is in new jersey so um let's actually see a picture of the woman that impregnated wow it looks like a man how did i know that a man impregnated a woman i don't know how i knew this it's i'm not a doctor but i think you got to be a man to impregnate a woman i'm not a doctor i want to be clear before and after i don't even know this is like the before picture of him when he was a man and this is the after picture of him now that he's a transgendered woman tyrone just put on a little eyeliner i think he shaved his beard i think he just said yeah he's being a little funny eyebrows a little bit yeah some eyebrow shaping but this is this is the stretch i mean this is where what is what's going to happen in the future if you are a man and you can find an advantage at becoming or identifying as a woman then you win you want to beat people in sports and have records then you just identify as a woman if you want to go to if you got some doing some time in prison and you ain't going to get no access to women all you do is become a woman and now you can impregnate women so i think this is you know where do we where is our country going by doing things like this this is blatantly obvious that this should not happen clearly he's impregnated two women that you know he's probably had relations with more than two women and we're gonna see this happen more and more in the future if we don't you know stand up against it it's brilliant it's absolutely brilliant i mean if i'm a man i don't want to go to a prison with other men and risk getting beat up i know that i'm safer in a woman's prison i know that i have i have the option to have sex with a woman i know that all i have to do is pretend that i'm a woman obviously i'm just a straight man a straight male criminal right um who doesn't want to suffer any real consequences so this is on behalf of criminals this is a brilliant strategy it's just about how long this brilliant criminal strategy is going to last before we as a society are allowed to formally acknowledge that men can never be women and women can never be men that's the question before us today yeah okay we are a high-tech society and we know what that means it means that we are getting awful side effects from staring at screens all day take it from me i swear my right eye is going completely dark you get headaches you get sore eyes you get digital eye strain you get watery eyes you get tired fatigued but guess what there's a solution and that solution is blue blocks blue light computer

stylish frames which helps they've been featured in gq and vogue and unlike other blue light glasses blue blocks uses science-backed technology tested to ensure that they work watch the results well

candace and use coupon code candace to save 20 i have a bipartisan solution to this you're not going to like the beginning part of this so bear with me i think we should have taxpayer-funded trans surgery for transgender inmates now the left always likes that sort of we already do have that well widespread i think so yeah really it's interesting yeah i think well we should promote it more because the left loves giving uh taxpayer dollars to in disenfranchised communities such as transgenders but now the problem solves itself because the next time an inmate says hey guard i think i'm a woman the prison guard gets to say okay let's schedule your surgery chop chop robert time to meet roberta and i guarantee you i guarantee you you have less transgender males in the in the female person you're right make it a requirement and they have to go through transition all right yeah i mean i'll pay for that this is this is becoming a joke i mean we're going straight from the you know the u-pen swimmer who is crushing records and now we're seeing this and yet they still won't formally acknowledge if you say on twitter as charlie kirk did or as sucker carlson shared that men can't be women and women can't be men if you put up these two pictures and you and you and you say obviously these are both pictures of a man before and after shave right before and after a jeremy's razor right and they they kick off your account and you're considered bullying and harassing i mean where are we right now in society you know i'm not a biologist actually i quite literally am a biologist that's what my degree is and it blows my mind that we have arrived at a time in american history where a man can walk around with a penis in a woman's locker room in a woman's prison out in the middle of pride parades fully nude and say i'm a woman today and society says yeah okay that's fine we're on board with that that's totally fine i i really think this is the hill we have to die on especially if we're serious about equality real equality not equity that the left is trying to push but what you know feminism was actually supposed to be way back when when it truly was about equality under law not pushing for people with penises to rape women and somehow call it progress and i've spent so much time thinking about this lately why we're going after kids especially with this ideology and trying to push this so substantially and i really think the left is aware that if they can convince an entire generation of people that maybe the most fundamental thing about their identity their biology their gender what formulates how they respond to stress who they're attracted to what they're passionate about what their passions in life will ultimately lead them to do they can convince them of anything if their gender somehow is not and they're real and innate and they're realizing how successful this can be we're seeing the effects of that every single day if we're serious about indoctrination and overturning that and actually educating people it has to start here because this is the most fundamental way that they are convincing children of nonsense thanks for joining me for

manhood obsolete we do not glorify families we do not glorify men in their strongest capacity which is leading households it's a it's a wonderful beautiful thing I was obviously you guys know how attached I am and was to my grandfather who passed last year and it was because of the way that he led the household he was to me the manliest man that could ever exist because he loved his family because he had faith and because he put both of those things first instead now we denigrate those things in our culture in American culture we view it as a sign of a man's weakness not to be surrounded around hot women all the time and that hints at a cultural illness and a cultural disease in which we will not have enough time to unpack today", "2oAa3Jofn3E": "so you may have seen me tweeting about this story yesterday because I'm pretty livid about it there is a young student named Marcus Stokes who had a scholarship offer to the University of Florida but that scholarship offer has been rescinded why because he said the n-word you might be thinking Candace that's really bad they caught him in a video on social media saying the n-word that's really really wrong except the context that you're missing here is that he was actually just wrapping along to one of his favorite songs so there was a song that he likes and he's rapping to it and in that song it says the N word repeatedly right and so because he's the wrong color he is going to have his scholarship rescinded now why is that problematic because I'm getting sick and tired of these double standards it drives me crazy that we are allowed to put this word in music and then we turn around and we say to society that depending on what color you are you may or may not be allowed to say it could you imagine that imagine if it was a word that only white people could say and black people couldn't say right and not only could why people say it but white people were saying it perpetually like just every other word every other sentence putting it in their music saying whatever word it was and then suddenly a black person came around and said it and they said oh you are going to have your life ruined you can't go to university because this is some special word that we have decided that only black people are allowed to say you might call that I don't know what is it racism in and of itself right you're looking at somebody in the color of their skin and you are saying that they are allowed to say something you might even say you might even go so far as to describe it as segregation right right the same people that are demanding that we put an end to the past and putting an end to racist policies are also saying that there is some special category that allows black people to partake in a word which by the way nobody should say nobody say the word if it's a bad word it needs to be bad all around not bad only when some people say it it is such Peak stupidity to suggest that a word that is that derogatory can somehow be reclaimed and Powerful right the only people that believe that people that believe that black people are stupid because everything that they tell us is ours is dysfunctional right oh that's yours you degrade yourself you you guys you've got it covered why why should we even call black people the n-word when they're so proud to call themselves the n-word in fact we're going to make them think that they have such a stake and a claim on that dirty word that we're they're going to start yelling if white people say it because white people are too good to say that word is that the idea that we're basically saying because that's what it suggests to me it suggests that white people people own a better part of the language right that they don't use derogatory terms like this and yet black people need to feel that it's proprietary to us I think that the University of Florida should be ashamed of itself in fact if this was my child I'd be suing them because what I would do is I would go find I would go through the social media channels of every single player on that team every single student that I could find went to the University of Florida and if I found even one student that was black and was saying that word and who did not have their scholarship rescinded or did not have their place the university rescinded I would say this is discriminatory because the truth is is that we have in place policies that prevent racial discrimination what this is on its face is racial discrimination and it makes me upset that this person issued an apology he issued an apology uh via Twitter and said my intent was never to hurt anybody and I recognize that even going along with the song My Words still carry a lot of weight that is that is ridiculous and his parents should have never made him issue that apology to make somebody a weaker individual to do something that makes entirely no sense and you want to know the great irony by the way in all of this is that typically the white kids that are rapping along to black music dropping the n-word are the least racist white people in society they are partaking in Black Culture I thought I call me crazy but I thought when Martin Luther King had a dream that was it that would that might have been it for people to engage in one another's cultures for people to come together and to celebrate one another's cultures for people like Marcus Stokes to say I like this rap artist so much that I want to learn all of the lyrics to his song only to be told nope nope nope nope that's not for you maybe just listen to white people music that would be less discriminatory somehow all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking

want to talk today a little bit about the american education system it's on my mind because i recently enrolled in two three university classes one of which is an english literary class english literary it's been 10 years since i've been enrolled in a college university class and things have really changed i've got three students in my class who have their gender pronouns listed as they them we are all encouraged to put what our proper pronouns are in this class which is kind of amazing to me so three students singular students go by they them you would think that in an english college course we would learn that that's just grammatically incorrect of course one person cannot be plural but the focus now is on how the students feel and if they feel like are they them something that didn't exist 10 years ago when i was in school then they're allowed to be called they them and we must call them by they them or else we're considered a bigot it's problematic you can get in trouble by not addressing these students by their right pronouns so forget the truth that they cannot be plural individuals it's all about how they feel increasingly that kind of seems to be the point of the american education system you want to make sure that students feel good doesn't really matter what they know but as long as they feel confident and that they feel empowered then somehow the teachers are doing their job here are some fun facts you ready one third of american 17 year olds do not know that abraham lincoln wrote the emancipation proclamation almost half don't know who joseph stalin was that doesn't surprise me kids love communism and socialism today and 30 percent cannot locate britain on a map i uh got these facts by the way from thomas soules book inside the american education system you guys know he's an absolute favorite of mine and he talks about a reporter who once spent months in a los angeles high school and he asked the graduating seniors what they had learned and and here is what the person who was described as the smartest student in the class told the reporter he said quote i learned that in the vietnam war north and south korea fought against each other and then there was a truce at the 38th parallel and that eisenhower had something to do with it end quote he learned that north and south korea fought in the vietnam war that's pretty special right so the reporter obviously then asked him would it bother you to know that what you learned is wrong to which the student replied not really because what we really learned from miss over was that we were worth listening to that we could express ourselves and that an adult would listen even if we were wrong that's why missover will always be our favorite teacher she made us feel like we mattered like we were important to me sounds like a response from somebody who's maybe four years old now that's a 17 year old at the top of his class saying that he doesn't care but he has no idea what he's talking about because he feels good which means the teacher did a good job that seems to be increasingly what we're seeing more and more of especially targeted against minorities we've got a critical race theory that students are now learning in class which is essentially for black americans a way to blame pretty much any and all of our failures on white supremacy no matter what it is i got an f it's because you're a white supremacist i didn't get the job but i want it's because you're a white supremacist because america is backwards is there something wrong with america so we are right now mass producing children that have a lot of self-esteem about the nothing that they know super confident but they know nothing i think the question that probably most americans and definitely myself is wondering is why why are people working to implement a model that is so obviously unsustainable this cannot work long term kids need to actually learn hard academics i think maybe the answer is because sustainability that's not the end goal think about it what better way to weaken a country than to render its future generations entirely impotent wanna crush america follow these simple steps re writes the education system to teach a struggle-based version of academics where the west is no longer seen as a victor in the battle of ideas but the colonizer of them then convince students that that knowledge somehow makes them smart you're really smart if you know that america and the west they're just colonizers then brainwash those students to believe that losing is actually some kind of form of winning make them feel confident super confident in how they feel and award them meaningless bachelor and master degrees to convince them that they're superior lastly you plant that overconfident generation of idiots throughout successful corporations and then you watch the fireworks that's how you corrode something from the inside out i think to me that's the obvious long-term goal ensure that corporations give in to wolf culture ensure that corporations suspend the profitability model because an army of their blue-haired employees are educated about social injustice it's socially unjust to make profit that would promise a slow poisonous death to a free-market society in essence dumber kids equates to a dumber workforce a dumber workforce equates to a dumber america and a dumber america equates to a weaker america and a weaker america equates to a superpower no more america will be overtaken without a single shot fired thanks for watching this segment of candice

a banner that says Love Is Love No Love Is Love is not telling a child that they should alter their perfect little bodies um for an idea that will never manifest you cannot just think your way into a

thing where they cry for attention they cry and they will post these videos of them crying and I remember there was one person I used to follow that did this and I just thought in my head this person is deranged obviously because that is not normal behavior if you consider the steps to get to the point where you're crying online rather than doing something normal like I don't know just crying by yourself or reaching out to a friend or calling a family member people that you know and that are there to come for you you grab your phone you quickly grab your phone and you press play so I don't know if you're holding back the tears or you're starting the tears but think about that process of your first instinct when you have a real emotion is to do something as inauthentic as grabbing your

kind of made myself a staunch adversary of the black lives matter movement it is the antithesis of everything that I believe in as an American first and foremost and no yeah they're operating under the guise of something that's common sense black lives matter and and they're doing nothing to prove or to show that black lives matter to them because they don't care about black lives we know that all across America uh in in major cities uh black crime rate has gone up black homicide rate has gone up black people are dying because of black lives matter activism uh people burning down and looting black neighborhoods taking away black jobs uh so I I hate everything to do with black lives matter um and I have used my platform and my voice to speak out against what is ultimately a big lie right this is all built upon the idea that black Americans are being gunned unarmed by police officer we're just peacefully you know do up doing our business and a police officer sees us and they come up to us and they want to shoot us and they want to kill us and that's a lie there's no systemic racism there is no law there was nothing that says that I can't do something as a black person that you can do", "wvQAbBeM25I": "I guess I would have assumed when black lives matter announced that they raised 90 over 90 million dollars who knows how much over on the back of the George Floyd riots and the sprees where is that money I don't know it's not here [Music] feeding looks worse than it was is it possible that Black America was sort of used as a front and the emotions that Black America was feeling was used as a front and this money went probably maybe not to black people at all anywhere in the world so many elements of people who took advantage of the death of George Ford to stop the emotions for political gain for financial gain and to propagate division because some of these organizations that raise money they can only get money if they propagate hatred and division they are not

that it's indicative of the fact that we now live in mob rule this is mob rule society i mean this is based on the evidence that we saw and this was polluted from start to finish so to me the most important element of this which i found to be astonishing was the fact that they never released the full police footage they had it they sat on it they locked it down it leaked months and months later after the riots you know via the daily mail i think but when i watched the full tape i was astonished that they didn't think to just at least add this context so that people understood yes this person was high out of his mind he asked to be put on the ground he was resisting arrest let's not forget what the media what they did the power they had in setting up this narrative to begin with first the media said he was just getting his life together do you remember st george you guys remember seeing george right he was just getting his life together he had moved to minnesota yes he was you know had been in prison in the past but he was just helping the youth and everyone was crying and it was oh my gosh this man you know was getting a second chance at life and you know maybe had the wrong id or whatever it was was was using counterfeit bills and somebody called the police and then he was killed he was brutally murdered uh on the basis of him being black no indication uh nothing was said out of derek shobhan's mouth that you know should insinuate that this was about being black versus white but that was what the media ran with and then they successfully hid every piece of evidence that would have transformed public opinion right every piece of evidence that would have said wait a second there's more here and they were upset when i released a video and just went over his track record because it was clear to me according to his track record that it was very unlikely that a person that spends you know approximately nine prison stints nine stints in prison was really just getting his life together after having served the last one so you know to me i think the saddest part of this is that what we need to acknowledge is that right now mob rules the media creates the mob and the mob

"BLPBBsHKtCQ": "next thing I want to talk to you guys about Switching gears here is gender identity because it's very important that you do your part and just try to keep up with all of the 37 000 genders that are out there today and it's important that you do your part and try to come up with them because you don't want to be a bigot and it would be bigoted for you not to understand that everybody can be everything at all times and at no times including this young woman who is on Tick Tock which I have always described as a platform for mental illness in its entirety if you have a mental illness you should have a tick tock if you don't have mental illness maybe get off tiktok not just what I'm saying I think it inspires it but this young obviously almost gonna say woman crazy Candace crazy this young he she thingy it did a video and this is what the he she thingy it has to say take a listen you might have been surprised by my transgender pin that I put on this morning I figured it's about time that I came out and talked about my gender identity I am trigender which means like a triangle I have three genders male female and non-binary and the difference between trigender and gender fluid is that I feel all three of these genders at the same time all the time it doesn't ever shift or change or where I feel one gender more strongly than the other like gender fluid tends to be also I should recognize and accept that a lot of people don't see non-binary as a third gender they see it as something completely separate from the binary of male and female but for me it's like a third gender or I guess you could call it a Third identity so how I feel gender wise is like a man like a woman and as neither at the same time I hope this clears things up but let me know if you have any more questions I'm happy to answer what I love is that at the end of that she's like I hope this clears things up like no obviously that cleared nothing up like why would that why would that clear anything up I'm a man and I'm a woman and I'm neither at the exact same time I hope this clears things up so it's just complete lunacy I mean I am happy that these various illnesses are finding a home on Tick Tock I did not mean that last statement I just said I just said it I don't know hope that clears things up it's just like this is split personality disorder obviously you know it might even be equal parts schizophrenia but what this is not is an actual gender obviously if he's not a tri-gender she's a girl that is looking for attention and is finding it on Tick Tock and people are asking her more specific questions which is giving her a dopamine hit and realizing that she's on some Journey where people are maybe paying attention to her for the first time you know what I mean which is an element of growing up is trying to find your tribe and people are looking for attention and rather than being maybe the quiet kid who doesn't have a lot of school friends you can now become a very well-liked person by being extreme on social media and so that's what you're watching that's what you're observing you're observing a bunch of kids that probably are not comfortable in their own skin that are trying to be cool in some regard hard by pretending to be trigender or whatever gender that it is one alternative asset that you really need to check out is

you guys might be familiar with has launched a relationship type feature that lets daters specify if they're looking for monogamous or polyamorous partners hinge has introduced a new feature this week called relationship type it allows you to specify the type of commitment that you're looking for and it has come as research has revealed that five percent of people are now in polyamorous relationships so Michelle Parsons she's the chief product officer over at hinge says with the launch of relationship type we are empowering users to openly share what kind of relationship they are looking for and as a result have a new way to know if someone's dating goals match theirs the moment they look at their profile Fair totally fair I think it's yeah it's be nice to know if somebody just is into being a little bit promiscuous a little  and now you can have a filter that just says I'm pretending that this is a relationship type but in reality I just want to sleep with a bunch of women they have a bunch of women that are pretending that they're free and open to all different types when in reality they're just insecure and are commuting what they actually want to match the times and the times are telling them that the best way to be empowered is by realizing that you don't need a man and that you're open to all different types of relationships and that's it Society is what is putting these constraints on you and to really be loving and free and on ecstasy and Mali you need to swipe your relationship type to available to everyone and at the same time lose a little piece of your soul every time you go on one to one of these dates and so now I'm glad that hinge has provided that update so that you can freely give away your soul to whoever you want all right guys

caricature of what it means to be a woman I don't know any woman that talks like that like oh my God flowers like maybe they're in some Valley in California they actually speak like that uh but in

getting those stereotypes from it's a movie that they saw and they go okay I'm gonna be share and I'm going to shriek about an Elijah dress and I'm going to be like oh goodbye I'm So at the mall maybe

taught herself to play the piano what I love most about her is how much she used to hate her back when I was a liberal how I was one of the people that was conditioned to think that she was somehow not black because she was a Republican and so there is something humorous in realizing that I am now in that circumstance where people misunderstand me and think that they hate me and all I can hope

little bit of themselves so that you can have this Union so that you can stay in sync and it seems that when this came to Tom Brady when he had an opportunity to say thank you so much for being a wonderful wife thank you so much for being a wonderful mother and thank you for allowing me to have this career I am now going to step back he changed his mind and it's understandable that she feels

racist but one thing that's great about Tick Tock is that if you're black and you're openly a black supremacist you can put out whatever you want because hatred toward white people is totally fine in 2022 especially on social media they condone the behavior they encourage the behavior and there is a young woman who it describes herself as a black supremacist and she has made an appearance on Tick Tock in which she spoke at what is being alleged to be her father's funeral it's very clear that she is at the very least talking about a dead man who is her father and she basically gives a speech saying that he's a bigot and who cares if he's dead and this is the eulogy that she gave to her father at his own funeral take a listen Dad please know that while I'm graceful and highly aware of all that she's given this family I still don't miss you when you've done feel like there was a hole I missed something but it wasn't you it was the idea of what you could become I miss being able to Hope and wish that one day you turn the corner and see the world from my perspective I missed the idea that one day you might help me fight for the things that matter I missed my fantasy of you because when you died it solidified the fact that she'll never be what you could have been but only what you are and what you are is a racist misogynistic xenophobic trump-loving sister white man that is all you will ever be to me and Dad before you tell me to respect the dead please remember that you disrespected and disregarded the lives and death as an entire communities of people with your ideology you told me to Never back down so I won't you know for a fact that even against you I'm not afraid to share my peace you are everything I Aspire not to be and I refuse to stand up here and sing the Praises of a man who was the Paradigm of white supremacy so I'll take your racist mindset I'll take your money and I'll take your advice and I swear to God I will make this world a better place not at all because of you but an exact opposition to you I didn't hear much of an Applause following that because awkward man I bet you could hear a pin drop after that it's so dark and it's so twisted and what's very apparent to me is that she probably thinks she's having a Maya Angela moment she's like probably thinking that she's incredibly Brave and she's written out this poetry and people are going to jump up and they're going to applaud her and no that isn't the circumstance because I don't care what your perspectives are I don't care how much you hate Donald Trump this level of trump derangement syndrome is heartbreaking and it's disturbing that she's nothing but an ideologue she's ill at the End by the way she says I'll take your money yeah we know you know you'll take his money that's tends to be how it goes you know you go off to a university you learn some ideas your parents are still supporting you you actually have to start a life on your own but you're convinced that you have ideas that are unique perspective is when in fact you've just been implanted into your head so far so far into your head and into your mind that you are standing up at your father's funeral and you are saying disgusting awful horrific things about them so I think what's sad about the internet is it's forever and of course eventually her brain will mature and she will live to regret this moment or she will have to in order to rinse herself with the guilt go even further her into her delusions and trying to justify her behavior I mean I couldn't imagine I would not be able to stomach if I went to school or I knew this person at all I would just think they were the most horrible individual I mean I don't care who they support the idea of doing this when your father is dead and in the ground and thinking that this is a moment of Bravery is so indicative of the many things that are wrong with American culture today and the many things that are wrong with Tick Tock as I always say to you which encourages people to do more and more extreme things for likes and what better and more extreme thing to do for likes than to insult your own dead father in a PO like in a poetry slam

end of our seats wondering is this guy going to get his life back or are people going to be so fearful of mob justice and people coming after their families they're just going to vote the way that the

not saying that I'm not Nostradamus either I called it on the black lives matter movement and I want credit for it I mean like I'm exercising no humility here I spent years years being called a race Trader everyone's saying I hated my race I was supporter of white supremacy cancer is a racist I was saying no there are corrupt organization and it's pretty obvious if they're corrupt and nobody's asking the obvious question which is where is all of the money going there were no Towers there were no black lives matter building corporate buildings being built they were raising Millions close to a billion dollars all over the world everyone was starting up a little fun going around the tin saying black lives matter black lives matter no questions asked well now they're asking questions because the New Yorker left leading publication by the way did an expose revealing that the black lives matter Global Network spent six million dollars on a mansion in Los Angeles and they attempted to obscure the purchase from Financial disclosure they didn't want anybody to know that they purchased the house even more hilariously black lives matter themselves recently came out on Twitter a bit of a diatribe May attempted to justify the purchase saying that it was made to quote encourage black creativity with the property and a space for black folks to share their gifts with the world and hone their crafts as we see it I don't know what that means all I know is I was not invited and I am black and I did not get to share with the world my gifts and my crafts in their multi-million dollar mansion so here's the deal as I am not at all trying to exercise any humility here I'm also going to make a few more predictions because a lot of the stuff is really obvious what's coming around the corner of the left tries to make us think that we're crazy as conservatives and they will smear you and they will libel you and then they will quietly admit that yeah no we were right so say I'm going to make five more predictions into the future of what I believe is going to happen in this country you ready all right prediction number one what will follow this black lives matter movement which was really just a way to criminalize our streets right autonomous zones you can no longer arrest people if people shutting if they can't breathe all the time now and the police come across them what was naturally going to happen I've been saying this for years is that the left is going to wait until the cities get so bad that they're going to demand a federal police force that is what this entire thing has been about through my eyes it makes common sense when you look at communist Nations you can't have these local police forces rising up the government has to control all the police forces what better way to make that happen quickly than to make sure that criminality is so bad all throughout these inner cities that eventually the Mayors turn around and say please please anybody anybody that can help please send us and the FEDS are going to say we're going to send boots on the ground that's what's around the corner prediction number two that I'm going to make and I have been making is that the president zielinski hero narrative is going to fall apart we saw it go from George Floyd to Dr fauci and now the media is President zelenski the hero that we didn't ask for and unfortunately nobody is asking the right questions about him they're creating that same bizarre either or snare either your four black lives matter or you're a racist it's now either you say president zielinski is a hero or you're a pro Putin puppet and no that's not the way I operate two things can be true at the same time it can be sad and wrong that Russia has invaded Ukraine it can also be true that president zielinski is corrupt he is corrupt and he is involved with our sitting President Biden and their family interests there's a lot more that meets the eye here and I'm going to hold the line on that perspective I'm not giving them one inch prediction number three this is one that I think no one is paying attention to and it pertains to assisted suicide I've been talking about this for the last couple of weeks on my show that in Europe we're seeing this increase in assisted suicides first it was if you're terminally ill you can walk into a clinic and kill yourself well now they're saying you don't have to be terminally ill you just have to want to die you can kill yourself we're seeing organ is just extended to all of the states you don't no longer have to be a person that lives in Oregon you can just say oh I'm terminally ill and I live elsewhere in the United States and we're also seeing in Canada they're saying that people that are mentally ill they're looking at them killing themselves you're going to see an increase in believing that suicide is a right and that governments and institutions should raise up and help individuals do that help people commit suicide that sounds insane right now I promise you tomorrow you're going to see some ferocity to that number four is a very serious one my prediction and I've been saying this as well for some time they're going to attempt to normalize pedophilia it is so obvious it is everywhere it is existing and people telling children that they can pick their genders because that is naturally what is going to happen when you begin normalizing mental disorders look around you everyone has a mental disorder of a different variety you have people that are scared when they see a child breathing you have children that believe that they can pick their gender and you have people that are teaching them that are screaming in the streets with all different types of hair being told that they're free this is this is what it means to be free this is what it means to be virtuous when mental disorder becomes a virtue they're no longer able to identify good versus evil pedophilia is an evil and eventually we are going to arrive get there very quickly by the way we're going to arrive at pedophilia being normalized very soon we're already seeing the beginning of that my final prediction number five is that big Pharma is going to begin stepping up its efforts in a very big way why because covid and covid policy violated the social contract between the government and parents prior to covid parents were walking around believing that big Pharma genuinely wanted to help their children maintain their health so parents submitted from 12 to nearly 74 vaccines for their children and an increase had happened by the way over just a few short decades like if you talk to your parents they got 12 shots the kids today by the time they complete school they're getting around 75 injections in their arm parents were okay with that but now parents are beginning to ask questions what even is Public Health why is my child forced to sit behind a mask for eight hours per day why don't I as the parent get to make those decisions why can't I decide if my child is sitting behind a mask why can't I assess the risks yeah no the social contract has been violated and so now the government and big Pharma are going to have to grow more totalitarian so you should prepare yourself for an increase in homeschooling which is going to result because parents are going to say I've had enough here and then you're going to see an increase in policies preventing that the states are going to start to make homeschooling less attainable and they're also going to make exemptions for vaccines for religious reasons or otherwise completely unattainable that's already happened in California by the way but it's going to happen much quicker because big Pharma is going to go uh oh parents are awake they're paying attention to what we're doing what we're promoting these pills that we want to give your kid hormone blockers yes what is it what is a child that believes in picking its gender become it becomes a big form of customer for life ultimately what we have around the corner is a war Global governments versus the people that they desire to govern like gold or like overseas oil you and your children are now the commodity worth fighting for and trust me it's going to get ugly but here's the good news my ultimate prediction is that they can't keep Pace with the worldwide Awakening that is taking place we are learning through their every effort to conceal it that their lies can no longer keep Pace with the truth and so in the end my friends we will win dinner time is special for

slowed down yeah and he waits his life the last five seconds to kind of get ahead and he's like oh pulled that one out and so this is him winning uh the recent end of ncaa 500 millimeter freestyle i don't think it's millimeter meter party 150 meters had to work for it she was pushed over the first three had to work for it thomas wins the ncaa championship ended up very close for second you've undoubtedly been under the spotlight over the past few months how have you been dealing with that and reasoning with everything i try to ignore it as much as i can i try to focus on my swimming uh what i need to do to get ready for my races and just try to block out everything else yep so the fact that they're just ignoring the criticism is a very male thing to do like honestly like you get like a woman like somebody looks at a woman the wrong way and i'm like what did i say like what did i say also the fact that this person like flashes their genitals just like chilling in the room is a very male thing to do someone accusing um fox or tucker carlson of photoshopping on male genitals and it's like no those are they're pretty intact that's literally just a photo of leah thomas in a swimsuit packing a penis sorry demographic but that's literally what's going on but it's a female it's disgusting like how on earth did we get to 2022 where all these women come forward anonymously to their school because they're afraid of the backlash and they say hey we're literally being sexually harassed in our locker room our teammate is walking around with their penis out all day long literally telling us i'm physically sexually attracted to women and you say yeah sorry we can't do anything about that right yeah yeah i know it really is you're right though like do you credit it's

again oh just about look at the first 300 he actually lost a race this last week too nobody's covering that in the media because he won the 500 meter race and then in a finals i think it was for the 100 meter swim very short distance purposefully i think lost because was it against the harvard transfers of craziness i don't know that's been interesting i think it's very possible that they lost

to get into i'm excited because i have new graphics and i'd like to premiere them first we are going to talk about the category of politics first up we have to talk about joe biden unfortunately we have to keep talking about him but i have to say it makes me happy that peter ducey is out in the world fighting every single battle because he's just he's very good at his job you know he's always so calm and so matter-of-fact and he has the facts to back it up and he's basically just asking uh joe biden why he's constantly going back on his word that he said last week let's watch peter do that are you worried that other leaders in the world are going to start to doubt that america is back if some of these big things that you say on the world stage keep getting walked back then what's getting walked back it made it sound like just in the last couple days uh it sounded like you told us troops they were going to ukraine it sounded like you said it was possible the us would use a chemical weapon and it sounded like you were calling for regime change in russia and we know none of the three occurred none of the three none of the three mr president you you interpret the language that way i was talking to the troops we're talking about helping train the troops in that are the the ukrainian troops that are in poland that's with the context i sat there with those guys for a couple hours that's what we talked about so when you said you're going to see when you're there you were not intending i was referring to with meeting with and talking with the ukrainian troops who are in poland and when you said a chemical weapon used by russia would trigger a response in kind it will trigger a significant response what is that i'm not going to tell you why would i tell you you got to be silly the world wants to know the world wants to know a lot of things i'm not telling them what the response would be then then russia knows the response he's fascinating i do believe joe biden that he doesn't remember what he said yesterday that's the only thing i mean he doesn't he doesn't know and and furthermore he knows that he's not the one setting policy this is actually why i don't think that when biden speaks it causes these huge reverberations is because everyone knows zelensky knows putin knows xi jinping knows that biden is not the one setting policy biden says something insane and then the white house walks it back who is the white house if not joe biden the white house is the staff the administrative state the kind of permanent government this is not true of every presidency some presidents have a real strong will they have a real strong vision of the world i'm thinking of the last guy mr trump that guy when he wanted something he got what he wanted he would not let those bureaucrats tell him what to do joe biden has never believed anything in his whole life that's he's just been i'm not even meaning to insult him he's just an empty suit politician he wakes up in the morning he licks his finger he figures out which way the wind is blowing somebody tells him to finger and which way the wind is that's right yes and so when he gets that sheet of paper and it says here's what you have to say here's how you have to contradict yourself don't do this he just goes along with it because he doesn't want to do very much he just wants to kind of be the president and maintain the status quo but he can barely even go along with it if you saw the script it was like question one is x and he's supposed to say a and b yeah you can't even do that and we have that i'm going to pull that out before you even comment on it let's pull it up actually this is what he's holding in his hand accidentally held it up and we can get a close-up and you can see it says tough putin q a talking points like even the way that's written is like for a second greater when they ask you these tough questions here are the answers and you're they've laid out the answers if you weren't advocating for a regime change what did you mean can you clarify i was expressing the moral outrage i felt toward the actions of this man i was not articulating a change in policy number two macron said he would have used these answer no nato has never been more united the thing that's sad about this is that he can't remember two questions and answers like i i memorize this he actually has to hold these two things in his it's two questions and two answers or they're telling him to remember and he's holding it to remember it and that end well just that that answer there i was expressing my moral outrage what he's saying is the words that i say don't have meaning they don't mean what i am don't believe what i am saying don't believe your lying ears i'm just a big ball of emotion but these are two basic questions that the reporter is saying why can't this man answer and we know he has absolute verbal incontinence right and other kinds of possibilities but also memory issues like i said they're they're giving him these notes it is just two questions any person if i said right before he walked outside hey michael if somebody in the audience asks you this question just you know just say no no no we'll be talking about that next week he needs that written michael say no no no no we'll be talking about that next week that's the weird part is that there's clearly some mental deterioration you should be able to just prep your guy to go outside and respond to the press but he doesn't have that and you're right the better question peter should have asked is just you know how this makes america look on the world stage and you are you're correct no but every nobody believes that biden is in power people know that they're pulling his strings and they know that he is in steep mental decline and that's not even meant to be an insult it is just the reality um which we've addressed day in and day out since he's been running and now it finally seems like you know the press is starting to ask questions but they're they're still covering for him all the time the other really sad thing is that biden is merely a vessel of the establishment that's what he's saying right they hand him the paper and he just says whatever they say the problem is the establishment is extremely incompetent and has done a terrible job the reason that we are in this war in ukraine now which is a proxy war between the west and russia at this point is because of the very stupid decisions that the west western establishment has made in recent years in in not countering putin the right way in basically falling into all of his traps that's what's led us here you had one president in the meantime who told the establishment to go pound sand that would be donald trump and they all said he was going to start world war iii well here's what i know donald trump was president for four years and we had basically the greatest period of peace in my adult life much better than obama better than bush better than biden and so if you've got this incompetent establishment now back again calling the shots how much worse are things going to get what does our

W for lizard boy Mark Zuckerberg has actually slammed Apple amid the company's Feud with Elon Musk so of course apple is sort of saying they're very interested in content moderation especially when they can't control people are saying they notoriously kicked parlor out of the App Store and essentially you will play by the left's rules or apple will kick you out that's essentially what we have come to understand and of course they're kind of squeezing in all of them on Elon Musk right now because they're realizing that he's not playing the game of the left and Mark Zuckerberg actually had something negative to say about Apple so let's listen to him in his own words Windows Android iOS hopefully the future ones around the metaverse that will get built apples stands out as the only one where one company can control what do what apps get on the device right that wasn't the case in Windows that isn't really the case on on Android phones and Google mic control goes in the in the in the Play Store but they've always made it so that you could sideload and have other app stores I do think Apple has sort of singled themselves out as the only company that is trying to control um like unilaterally what what apps get on a device and I don't think that's a sustainable or good place to be it's sort of shocking to hear him say something and to Echo the sentiments of how everybody has been feeling and of course you want to go yay good for Mark Zuckerberg for Having the courage to do this this isn't courage just so we're clear what's actually happening is that Elon Musk has done something courageous it takes somebody to stand up and be the hero in order to inspire others to do the same and I have talked about this in the past when it was so fashionable for people to condemn Jack Dorsey I was very honest and saying that I actually met Jack Dorsey a couple of times I met him through Kanye at least he was known as Kanye West during that time he gave him my number we met up a couple of times I actually went to Twitter headquarters back when I was before I was at Daily wire and Jack Dorsey despite what people think I think that he's like this radical leftist activist was not that he was a man that was being held hoshish at his own company Jack Dorsey actually very much believes in free speech but he was always sort of this quiet techie guy just what you would imagine doesn't like the cameras doesn't like attention he's not a Mark Zuckerberg who tends to love the spotlight and I think that he completely caged the pressure at his own company and he allowed these people to kind of flood it and tell him how it was going to be run if he wanted Twitter to be able to sustain itself and he allowed that to happen because he was a coward not because he was a bad person um now can cowardice lead to bad things absolutely we're living in those times right now we it all it takes as that fashionable quote says is for good men to do nothing for bad things to take place and in the circumstance what's happening in social media I think what it really amounts to is a bunch of good men that did nothing like Jack Dorsey who was too scared to do anything and now you have Elon Musk who's not that right you have somebody who's saying no we need free speech if we don't have free speech if America doesn't have free speech then the West will fall and he's been right and so he's done something tremendously heroic and in doing that has given the permission for other CEOs who have felt this squeeze to say yeah no maybe maybe I'll pop my head up and actually say what I really think and what I really believe that this is not a sustainable model that Apple actually shouldn't have the right to decide who gets to have an app right we're talking about the free markets I don't understand how this has been allowed to go on for so long and So speaking truth to power although it is too late as I said represents a rare W for lizard boy all right guys next portion of the

insanity they say oh no this is an insane you're insane you know and that's that that gaslighting that is happening across the board to so many people who are waking up and realizing that there is

philosophy to say here is what we all have in common but within the group of American culturalism there's also going to be subsets of different variants of cultures that are united for different

which is interesting you know it feels like right now we're doing black history in june and of course it's relative because everything that has to do with racial injustice is relevant today people want to dig up history and talk about it so you know what today i'm going to dig up some history and i'm going to talk about it i have an event a black history event that i would like to discuss on my show today it is the tuskegee experiment how many of you guys are familiar with that it was actually officially called the tuskegee study of untreated syphilis in the negro male in this study began in 1932 and it was conducted by the united states public health service which is a division by the way of the department of human health services and also the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc the purpose of the study was to observe the natural history of untreated syphilis but that is not what the black americans that were enrolled in the study were told our government decided to enroll 600 impoverished black sharecroppers from alabama 399 of them which had syphilis and they told them the government came and said we're going to give you free health care we're here to help i love it the government is always here to help they didn't give them any information pertaining to their diagnosis and of course they were not actually there to help while they were told they were going to be treated for bad blood which was kind of a catchphrase for a bunch of things it could have been for fatigue it could have been for anemia they actually just wanted to watch these men die that was the purpose penicillin became widely available in 1943 so all they had to do was offer these participants a pill penicillin and they would have been treated they would have been fine but they did not want to treat them they knew it was effective they could have saved lives instead they watched them they told them by the way that the experiment was only going to last for six months the study we're doing it's going to last for six months the government said we're here to help six months didn't last for six months again in 1932 it went on until 1972. these men were dying they were going blind some of them were going crazy and nobody said anything in fact and this is to me the sickest piece of the entire story some of them went to their private doctors i don't know what's going on doctor i'm sick i don't know what's going on i i'm going blind i'm going crazy and our government contacted their private doctors and said hey don't treat these guys we're actually observing them they're a part of a study that they don't know that they're in so please don't treat them so doctors knew that their patients had syphilis knew that they had to solve for that syphilis they knew that they could have given them a pill and saved their lives and they declined to do so because our government told them not to wow that was until the 1960s when a guy by the name of peter buxton who was a venereal disease investigator in san francisco was also working for the department of health found out found out about this experiment he said this is wrong this study is wrong he expressed his concerns that it was unethical and you want to know what our government did well they conducted a review they said we should look at this peter seems upset let's look and see if this is the wrong thing maybe we should actually see if we should stop the study do you want to know what they concluded at the end they concluded that actually no we're going to keep letting these men die it's ethical we're gonna keep it going on the department of health and the cdc decided to still let more men die so that guy peter did the right thing and he leaked it to the press and in 1972 only because it was leaked to the press the study was shut down only because people found out about what they were doing did our government decide to do the right thing and stop it it's 40 years of watching men die by that time in 1972 128 of the participants were dead from syphilis or related complications 40 of their spouses were diagnosed with syphilis and the disease had been passed to 19 children at birth it's unbelievable to think about that it's unbelievable to think that the cdc in our department of health was supposed to be preventing death would allow men to die it took until 1997 for our government to officially recognize how wrong this was it was actually president clinton who issued a formal presidential apology here's what he said he said quote what was done cannot be undone but we can end the silence we can stop turning our heads away we can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the american people what the united states government did was shameful and i am sorry i love that quote so powerful bill i love the but we can end the silence right almost like people are saying you did something wrong for decades and government's just ignoring it just saying no no no we didn't do anything wrong and then finally okay we can stop silencing you guys we can admit we did something wrong uh-oh but so much time has passed who cares cdc is still there they were allowed to stay the department of health services is still there i don't i don't know if anybody was ever fired for that study but at least bill clinton said sorry for silencing you guys at home it reminds me really of my favorite biblical proverb what has been will be again what has been done will be done again there is nothing new under the sun i'm going to leave you with that bible verse and you can take from it

as soon as you just get into saying oh well all 65 year olds are like this you're kind of just categorizing them all like obviously Trump even at what is he 75 is way brighter than Joe Biden ever was probably throughout his entire career he's way sharper and that is contributed to his lifestyle Donald Trump notoriously has never drank alcohol he does not drink alcohol because his brother Fred died of alcoholism and I think that that has given him more longevity in his life and has made him sharper over time so I would not support it because we cannot decide how all 65 year olds are I know young

happened to us with the mask nazis at the airport yesterday we went through tsa we knew that the president of the united states had said this mandate's no longer in fact no one said anything we get to the gate for our boarding area and a flight attendant for a different flight that we weren't even on comes running full speed towards joe bob and i wearing her mask and gets very close to our face and screams it is federally mandated for you to be wearing a mask in this airport and i calmly said well no ma'am it's actually not the president of the united states has expressly said this mandate is no longer in effect well if you're planning on getting on my plane you better have a mask on your face and this kept up throughout the first half an hour of our flight or so until american airlines eventually came forward and said we're no longer enforcing this when mid-flight magically covid disappears i guess and half the airplane is allowed to take it off what if there was someone out there who kept the log of every single thing that you did every single minute of the day that would be creepy right well that's exactly what happens every time you go online your internet provider is allowed to store logs of every website that you've ever visited and they can legally sell that to anyone expressvpn reroutes your internet connection through their secure servers so your internet provider can't see or log what you do online now many of you guys might be wondering but if i'm routing all my data through a vpn then doesn't that just mean that the vpn can see what i'm doing and log my data instead expressvpn is the only vpn i trust because they were the first major vpn provider to engineer all of their vpn servers to run in ram making it impossible for their vpn servers to store any data expressvpn is so confident in their no logs claim they even had one of the biggest assurance firms price waterhouse coopers audit their technology it's no wonder the verge named expressvpn the number one vpn in the world stop letting people keep logs of what you do online visit expressvpn.com candace right now and find out how you can get three months free that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com candace but what really boils my blood more than anything else is that all this took for more than two years was one judge one person being courageous enough to say this is completely unconstitutional and instantly tsa says we're no longer enforcing this the white house says we're no longer enforcing this every airline comes forward this morning uber comes forward and says sorry we know we've kicked a ton of you off of our service and you can't ride in our cars anymore over the last two years but no more masks now one person really that's all it took well go ahead sorry i think the thing that irritated me the most is we're on the same flight every single person i know up in the front they didn't have that uh same every person but a hundred percent of the people on the flight took off their mass or at least that i saw which tells me every single person knew that it was ridiculous and so if that's the case why then didn't we all just collectively over the last couple months go you know what we're done with this because they were threatening to arrest you right so that's the only reason i mean the only place that i ever wore a mask was on a plane yeah and it was only because i was running the risk that you know and and running the benefits and going okay i'm going to an event to talk about you know the tyranny in society so i'm i'm willing to travel on a plane for an hour and a half mass i refused i was never going to mask my child like that was like completely out of the question and i can't believe that there are parents that actually did that um but that's why they were they were literally told that they were going to get a federal charge if they did not comply thanks for joining me for this segment of candice if you like this video subscribe

very seriously and uh all i say is stay tuned yeah i guess we'll take you out your word and that means that in 2024 trump and owens are gonna be on the ticket", "rwmHqh-Z44c": "did you hear that Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde broke up another point for the Candace was right tally [Applause] yes I did hear and I was not surprised whatsoever of course honestly I think it was a PR stunt she starts dating him right before the movie comes out causes all this drama and then she they break up when the movie is done and she's done with all the red carpets and people are done talking about her I think she is conniving she just gives me a Vibe I look at her face and I'm like this woman is conniving and a little crazy and I just felt that the Jason sudeika stuff the way that she handed it was very poor and by the way she won it was perfect Harry Styles did the movie they you know floated around town we're trying to love each other now he's out and she's out and both of them are richer and more famous because of it so I cannot hate the Playa I gotta hate the game", "jdvMWEJaaXY": "well if your name is Blue Ivy Carter and your mom is Beyonce who can do no wrong of course and your dad is Jay-Z you can bid on earrings at a charity auction and I'm not talking about 100 200 I am talking about 80 000 and this is not our first time bidding by the way but yes Blue Ivy is holding up a paddle and she is bidding on Lorraine Schwartz diamond earrings to the tune of eighty thousand dollars why I guess that's the question I'm gonna ask why is do you guys think it's a good thing that Blue Ivy is Raising her paddle and bidding on eighty thousand dollar diamonds is that teaching her to live within the realm of reality", "KYmelxaw7RI": "what in the next two years do you intend to do differently uh to change people's uh opinion of the direction of the country particularly as you contemplate a run for president in 2024. nothing oh nothing okay okay well uh that's remarkably honest of you Mr President I uh you know I I think I appreciate the honesty I didn't you weren't thought you were doing anything you haven't done anything I've even run for president really you hid behind a screen the entire time you had some cars talking about you at random moments and you got interviewed by cardi B you didn't really do anything to even deserve to live in the White House", "UqOl2-unVDc": "you know we're dealing with Maniacs there's no difference in my estimation between Justin Trudeau between Joe Biden between Emmanuel macron uh between Boris Johnson I mean when we're talking about this concept of globalizing it's governments in the west that have gotten into lockstep and realize that they can amass surmount power and then they can essentially modernize what a slavery Plantation was and they do it with such a Machiavellian scheme is to convince you that to not submit to it is a form of selfishness to not submit to the fact that you're going to have rolling blackouts this winter right just the green New Deal the Greta Thunderbird that's the propaganda pitch uh they're afraid about their future we're all going to die you know this is the idea to say that we must act now so we're gonna throw tomato soup out of Van Gogh to make you realize that it's not your government that's impoverishing you what it really is is you doing your part for the planet um I wish that wasn't so but humans are humans", "bPGG5cbwfpE": "welcome back by now you guys know that there is nothing that i hate more than media lies and its corresponding mob justice perhaps some of the greatest media lies over this past year were pertaining to the kyle rittenhouse trial ruthlessly smeared and libeled as a white supremacist the media became obsessed with pushing their lives about what happened in kenosha the night that he ran for his life so obsessed that they even stalked harass and punished those who supported the truth former lieutenant william kelly was one such man who was punished for siding with the truth when left wing hackers released the details of those who anonymously donated to kyle greenhouse's defense fund last year lieutenant kelly's name was among them the guardian of course the despicable left-wing rag of a publication released his name to the public which led to lieutenant kelly being fired and publicly humiliated by the norfolk police department in april of this year to be clear he donated just 25 kelly is a 19-year veteran and a father of three that did not matter he made the contribution anonymously so as not to draw attention or association to the police force that also did not matter his spineless police chief larry boone a radical blm supporter who attended blm rallies in uniform allowed the double standard of his dismissal to occur because to boone delivering mob justice mattered more than siding with the truth since his dismissal william who goes by bill kelly has been surviving on his savings and his wife's teacher salary this is unacceptable the routine threats lies and the duress that our police officers nationwide are made to face to satisfy the black lives matter radical narrative cannot continue all police officers officers have a right to privately support issues and causes that they care about in their off-duty time this particular circumstance tenant kelly was supporting the truth so in continuation of the thanksgiving day i thought i am extremely grateful to all of the men and women that serve in blue to the people that stand up and put their lives on the line daily to protect their community but also those that stand up to protect the truth so guys i am so grateful because sometimes they're standing up to criminals other times they're simply standing up to lies and i'm pleased to announce that lieutenant kelly is here today to share his story please give him a warm welcome [Applause] what an honor to meet you so [Applause] all right i am super super excited to have you here i'm assuming you did not expect to be on the candace show today yeah it's just like totally blow totally like not on your expectations at all out of the blue well i'm happy i liked i like to surprise people and you know so i caught the story actually i had not followed the story since last april it actually i saw it in the daily mail and i picked up on this obviously reading all the madness that followed the kyle woodenhouse trial and i saw the story and i thought this is especially horrific so i kind of just want you to take my audience through exactly what happened when it happened how it happened sure so just like everybody else in america i watched the videos that showed the shooting i watched the videos that showed kyle rittenhouse's interactions with the journalists beforehand and i thought it was a pretty clear cut case of self-defense just like a lot of people and you might know this by the way because you have a little bit of experience with this yes i've been a police officer for a minute and a half so i've got some experience in that field 17 years is that correct 19 and change 19 years and also in in the homicide division is that right i've worked homicide i've worked violent crime uh my growing up in the police department i was in violent crimes yes okay so i saw it it was pretty clear what had happened and when he was indicted for murder and for the malicious wounding i i couldn't believe it i i started thinking about why that might have happened and all i could think of was pressure from the public social social pressure so i just wanted to make sure that mr rittenhouse had the means to make his claim in court to a jury so i i chose to give him the 25 donation and he seemed like he was there for all the right reasons like his heart was in the right place you might be able to argue that it was unwise for a 17 year old to do that but he seemed like a legitimately good person who was there for the right reasons so i gave him some comments of encouragement and i thought nothing else of it and your comments were like keep your head up you know you did the right thing in this scenario like just totally encouraging but also anonymous correct so there's a box you could check for um giving the donation in the comments anonymously and i did check that box and nowhere in my comments did i say i was a police officer or that i work for the city of norfolk or the norfolk police department so i thought i was just going to be one of another 100 comments in an otherwise anonymous venue but then like you said there was a hacker hacker broke into the gibson go website interesting right that a hacker would choose i mean and this is kind of shows how vicious tons of things hackers could do right right hacking into a a campaign of raising money for illegal defense seems like a strange focus for hackers but they did it yes ma'am yes ma'am and they were able to connect my donation and my comments to me and then they were they figured out i was a police officer they gave the information to the guardian and the next thing i know i'm fired so how did you so tell me how you found out that your name was even released because i imagine i give anonymous donation i'm like you know what hope this kid figures it out i saw the video he did the right thing right where are you when you suddenly wake up and your whole life has changed you've been working for 19 years as a police officer and everything went upside down i'm getting ready for work one day and a fellow police officer called my cell phone and said that they started getting phone calls from different people who were critical of my decision to donate and he just want to give me a heads up so i called my boss i told him what was going on and he was like okay no big deal just come to the office write a letter of explanation you know so i didn't think it was going to be a big deal but then as the day progressed it became clear that they were starting to feel the pressure from the social media tweets and the emails and the phone calls and this is the mob justice that happens they say you know we're going to create a political pressure campaign until we get what we want this is literally what mob justice is right yeah it seemed to be divorced from logic and reason it was a strictly emotionally driven day but as the day goes on i'm doing several interviews i i asked to go home because we had received death threats and i had kids at home i was told no i have to stay finished doing these interviews and by the end of the day i started thinking there's no way they're going to discipline me this for this right and i come to work that monday and i'm fired wow so who sat you down and fired you it was my commanding officer it's normally the way it goes i had reached out to the chief over the weekend asking you know am i really going to lose my job i told him about the family and the insurance but uh never got a response back never got a chance to talk to him so you said i have a family i have three kids if i lose this insurance yeah yeah i know how expensive private market insurance is these days and i just having that that gap in coverage yeah scary it's scary for your whole family like it's just having the carpet he didn't even honor it with a response right so i want to weigh this against um by the way i do want to get to some of the quotes that came from the mayor but i first went away this response against the police chief who did march in uniform at a black lives matter event right right why was that okay it it's inconsistent if he can be on duty in uniform carrying a blm sign an organization that is a little controversial in america today uh the sign even calling for defunding the police by the way right and the sign even had the name of a person who had recently been shot by a norfolk police officer demanding justice for that person and the commonwealth attorney was still trying to figure out whether or not we should charge that officer criminally and in that environment that's when he chose to hold that sign and walk around the city of norfolk okay so when they terminated you what was the reason that they gave you they gave me a couple of alleged policy violations they said that i was acting as a spokesperson for the city and a spokesperson for the city of norfolk when i made those comments even though like we said it was anonymous completely not a hacker broke into it right took it and now they're saying you know what you were acting in capacity of a police officer they said that i engaged in conduct on becoming a police officer in that my comments brought disrepute to the police department and um they they alleged a few other things but those are the two big things okay so even though it's anonymous even though your comments basically said hey kyle keep your head up like you know they said this brought disrupt disrepute but they were totally fine with their police chief going out and exercising seemingly yeah his political beliefs has there been a feeling um and i have to imagine just amongst police officers in general all around the country that there that there is this sort of like there is no justice anymore like black lives matter is now running uh you know elements that should be all about justice that now it's like immediately people came to pressure because they just don't want to be smeared and libeled and called a racist police officers like the rule of law the law is black and white we apply the law equally in every situation regardless of who's involved and when we're told to stand down in certain situations when we would otherwise be making arrests it it's it's confusing and it's it certainly brings morale down right and the police chief he's black so he did really the opposite of what you did he publicly endorsed something politically he publicly stood out in his uniform and or something it was totally fine you do something privately hackers find it and it's not okay and they actually they're not done with that they also want to sort of publicly humiliate you right so i saw that the mayor i do want to pull up exactly what the mayor said um mayor kenneth cooper of norfolk said the statements and alleged actions of a member of the norfolk police department are alarming and and in are not in any way are in any way inconsistent with our city's values or the standards set for our employees so they're basically making alarming is a very that's a buzzword right it makes it seem like as if you said something like hey grab a gun and shoot some people like that's not at all what you said you just said keep your head up kyle privately and this is this is being released publicly i mean what is the response from people that you know you know friends in the neighborhood i can only imagine what your wife went through this is like suddenly you're thrown into the ringer publicly and the mayor is denigrating you despite the fact that you've served you know you've served this city for for 19 years so not only did the mayor make those comments but the city manager also came out with similar comments the police chief as well i'm a pretty smart guy i'm a hard worker i thought it'd be easy to get a job after i got fired but i couldn't get so much of a callback from employers and i can attribute a lot of that to the comments that were made publicly against me in terms of going out in the world and dealing with people it has been overwhelmingly supportive um tons of support from friends and co-workers uh we've had people bring dinner up to the house it's been it's been it's been awesome over overwhelming support and your work colleagues yes absolutely yeah uh everyone's encouraging me i i sometimes i have to just turn the phone off because i get i get so many texts of support from everybody wow that's so great i love to hear it well you guys you know we usually do this segment on the show called counterpoint we skipped the counterpoint segment today and i instead wanted to offer the ultimate counterpoint to the inherent harassment that lieutenant kelly and his family face for citing with the truth i think the point of his suspension and doing it so publicly was to humiliate him right so as a counter to the leftist point we are going to publicly celebrate his bravery and in the process hopefully humiliate every person involved in supporting the lie that kelly did anything to dishonor the norfolk community he did not kyle randhaus is innocent and so is lieutenant kelly you guys i promise you i was the biggest fan of ricky lake when i was a kid and every time they had a giant check on these talk shows i was like one day i just need to hold a giant check it just feels like it's more money so i started a campaign on give sen go for lieutenant kelly and his family i know they are still fighting this battle legally i don't care honestly what he does with the money i said i want to raise a hundred thousand dollars for him unfortunately that did not happen because you guys at home are amazing and instead we raised north of 240 000 didn't know that until this morning and i get to hold a giant check look at me in my giant chest [Applause] guys [Applause] i am living my childhood dream right now and can i just say by the way that this we had to get this printed yesterday and yesterday it was at 202 000 today this morning last last i checked it was at 240 000 so there's actually even more money that was printed here but this is just printed because i need to hold a giant check thank you julie this is for you stand up this is for you thank you man it will be more than this i mean genuinely i have to say this i am so grateful for our police officers i i can't even imagine especially in today's political climate what it's like knowing that you're fighting for justice and you have an entire political ecosystem of horrible people that are constantly fighting against you fighting to defund you telling you that you're not allowed to exist unless you side with narratives that are actually lies so this just makes me so happy it's more money than we expected so i mean if you want to buy me something for christmas whatever whatever i'll take it um thank you so much to you for standing up for truth we hope you get reinstated and i hope you sue the city for what they did to you i honestly mean that thank you so much so they can take that congratulations awesome thank you so much [Applause] how is that for thanksgiving guys how is that for thanksgiving i mean just go out and be sure to reach out to the community members that are supporting your community we should always be grateful for the guys and the girls in blue they're going through it thanks for joining me on this

cream is consumed by joe biden and we can show you how serious these reporters are you're not getting in uh rocky road for infrastructure what we call [Music] is that the hardest decision you've had to make recently actually probably yeah for real [Music] i have nothing to say here i'm just going to be silent and let somebody else say something about this it's the cameras clicking at lightning speed for me we just have to capture every single moment of every ice cream cone ever ever purchased by this president the background don't cover anything can i make can i make a very deep a dark joke

this but other countries have tvs too and they can all see these things happening and so i mean when this is what the american press is covering we can't really be surprised when it comes to like g7 summits no one's paying attention to joe biden because they know like the only information really going on up there is probably like rocky road metaphor for infrastructure black and white swirl racial harm right that's the message of trying to we're going to get tough on china like china's like man come on man you're just at the ice cream store yesterday like yeah taking you seriously and that's the truth we're no longer being taken seriously on the world stage and what's happening in russia and the refusal of so many countries even pick up the phone call really shows you like where american

by absolutely everything and it makes it impossible to have a proper conversation because if you take offense about everything then how can you have a balanced discussion so my question is how do we get the young people today not to take offense and to look at things subjectively and have a proper conversation that's a great question i think that with age they're going to realize that being offended all the time is not going to earn them a job or earn them any success it's just no way to go through life you can't permanently be offended by every question and by every task that's asked of you unless you want to be a failure and i do think that the system that allows for that mentality does want to mass produce failures so i think most of these people are living in some realm of idealism whether that's in the classroom whether that's at home where they believe that every single feeling that they have is valid and quite frankly it's not um sometimes you just have to step aside from your feelings and say i need to be remain more objective and complete the task at hand and i think that when they get out into the real world they're going to come up against a really hard wall and that's a good thing i think that experience toughens people and realizing that crying about every single political topic or crying because you have disagreement with somebody is no productive is not a productive way to live through life is probably what they need they need more real life experience um unfortunately you're not going to be able to give that to them they just have to sort of grow up and and as i always say woke-ism is the quickest path to failure so i think stay tuned and you'll see that they will wake up and realize they have to change something and usually it's the

becomes real and unfortunately the issue of antifa I think to a lot of people who want let's say following events or um necessarily interested in politics or that it's they don't even know about it

moment of silence uh basically because it was worse than 9 11. it was worse than pearl harbor i'm fully fully ready to admit that nancy pelosi's eyebrows and [Applause] [Laughter] we lost them we lost them they're on her temples i mean i just i i can't like i mean i looked at this and i was genuinely shocked when i saw the clip and they were sharing this clip as was she by the way she looks very shocked as well [Laughter] they were sharing this clip seriously you know like i don't even i don't even know what she was saying there's nothing you can listen to after you see this and my conclusion is that the doctor is a republican the doctor who did this a national treasure is a national trust or a huge fan of mcdonald's look at those golden arches it's just great so here's what i'll say candace about this perhaps this is nancy pelosi who's going through a couple of scandals here on the insider trading front she's worth a hundred million plus dollars but she only gets like a hundred thousand dollars a year in her annual salary how does that work insider trading that's the goal and so what she's doing here is a huge service to all of us she's showing us how to buy stocks you see you don't want to buy stocks down there buy stocks buy stocks down there sell up here right she's showing us buy the dip buy the debt that's right that's right that's right buy there sell there then don't sell there right it's right she's trying to help us all your strategy for insider trading right on her face wonderful assessment it's a map that we are looking at like i was actually just

they view them as proprietary subjects this has gone on for Beyond so many scandals that have happened in terms of military men and women being experimented on throughout the years and it's why I was

know everybody is on the edge of their seats they're going candace when is the blm dock dropping you told me it was going to be here and now it's pushback i know we had to include the financials of black lives matter once they dropped it we knew it was too good not to report on but today as a nice teaser for you guys i have two very special guests that are from the documentary the greatest lie ever told george floyd and the rise of blm liz colin has worked for 20 years as a multi-emmy award-winning journalist she left the mainstream media this year to work for an independent news organization in minnesota that's called alpha news bob crull her husband served 32 years in the minneapolis police department 25 of them elected to the union board retiring as lieutenant and president of the union in addition he served 21 years in the army reserve please welcome liz cotlin and bob kroll do you guys suffer from any ptsd from the scenario because i can't imagine going through that especially you you're like i'm a reporter you know i'm a news anchor i've been here for 12 years this is my home you know now you're not with them anymore because they pretty much didn't want you back because you married you know you married someone that had something to do with the police and you know i can't imagine that you don't suffer from some sort of post-traumatic stress from these events that you went through well that's why you know we think the world of you because you have the courage to bring this story forth and i think it's taken people quite a while in minnesota to speak up i think people were quiet for too long you know we have kind of been like that we have been laying low and we it just was not something that you could you could win um but but we're kind of asking you know if this is this isn't is this the right side of history where we have record homicides in minneapolis we have gunshot wound victims up a thousand percent in one area of of minneapolis is this what this is supposed to look like bob mentioned the hundreds of police officers that are no longer on the job i think they've lost a third of the force right right our chief at the time it was a black police chief and he got on national media and said he's walking away from contract negotiations which kind of spiraled the problem that that was the federation the union doing it but you mentioned ptsd we've had a number of officers that the department went from nearly 900 down to um we're approaching 550 now so they lost well over a third of the police department uh last year we tied for the highest murder uh numbers in since 1995 we've had the most we ever had is 97 homicides that was last year we just had our 42nd homicide this morning um so we're on the way to a record year and truly the the people that are suffering this is the black community in the city and they want more policing quite honestly they are on the side of the place and it's everybody that's trying to fix their problems from the suburbs that don't live there which sadly but i think in a way we became collateral damage but police officers across the country did so our story is one that i think many people uh can relate to but these officers what they had to to live through with with the riots and what they have to deal with with angry crowds people have left they've got out of the career completely some just took their regular retirement as a diet i stayed a little longer than i had to but i went regular retirement uh in january of last year and nothing's changed everything's gotten worse i mean the crime in every level of violent crime is way up officers not only leaving the job to do other things they're going to other agencies leaving minneapolis and they can't hire they've got a lateral class of one right now so it begs the question who won in all of this right certainly not the black community not the residents not the residents of minneapolis or the business owners right no there is no winner in this there's no winner in this do you have the same perspective absolutely this is uh again i we had calm cool heads in the in the in the beginning um many many people didn't but the right questions weren't asked everyone was given a free pass and i felt that the media was was pushing this narrative that there was so much more to this story um but people were afraid were afraid to look into that right well we're finally finally doing the deep dive on the story and it's the whole is way deeper than we could have ever imagined when it comes to black lives matter and the financing the and the politicians that stood behind this and so i just want to ask you guys as a parting question for each of you what do you hope comes from this exposure in sharing your story in us doing a documentary it's you know it's years later now people seem willing to actually listen um what do you hope comes from this just exposure the false narrative of the whole thing that it was politicized it didn't have to be um it's right versus wrong and suppressing the truth and i think that um we can't let the bad guys become become the good guys this isn't what we should never do this again this this can't happen this was this to me was clearly about politics and it just got completely out of control and i just don't think it can happen again that's why i left the station where i was i just i felt like as a mom as a journalist i i want to expose some of these these stories that that you know have never been told even though we have you know three television stations in minneapolis and we have a large newspaper but they were all repeating the the same lies in my opinion thanks for joining me on this segment of candice if you like this video subscribe to this youtube

you're like me you probably thought well yay finally the redheads get something right you know they're the true minority that nobody talks about ariel who had beautiful long red hair and it was actually one of my favorite movies i was a big disney disney child disney baby of course nothing can be left as it is and they are now producing a mermaid movie in which ariel is black now are there black people with red hair sure yes um it's not common for black people to have red hair it is in fact a a nordic trait if you will irish really if you want to talk about specificities but they're going to make her black because everything must be black it's that's the answer", "0b2-8-auubM": "hello and welcome did you know that bill gates is spending 1.7 billion dollars to fix the us education system i'd still like him right every time we hear about bill or melinda gates they just seem to be extending their tentacles into everywhere because they're philanthropists right they just want to help these people just wake up every day and go how can we help it's all about helping so he's decided to help with what he views to be problematic math he says math suffers from you guessed it white supremacy so he's put forth an equitable math curriculum you're probably going equitable i keep hearing that word what is equitable math everywhere we're talking about there needs to be more equity everywhere well equitablemath.org which is his organization describes the problem as being a white supremacy culture that shows up in math classrooms when the focus is on getting the right answer that's that's the problem the problem is that it's a white supremacist idea to now get the right answer in classrooms so they decided they're going to fix that they're trying to introduce all across the country no need to get the right answer basically they're going to make your kids stupid and they're going to hire the guys of white supremacy and make sure children as long as they're trying their best they'll get an a right check you were completely wrong but we're going to give you a correct because that would be the equitable thing to do and this infuriates me for a lot of reasons and infuriates me because we are just seeing so much perversion inside of classrooms so much perversion in general when it comes to children especially in the education system you might remember a few weeks ago we talked about a woman named justine fonte she is a health and wellness educator and here's what the health and wellness educator did she led a class on masturbation for first graders at a manhattan school she showed the young students a video about children touching themselves the film featured children cartoon characters having frank discussions about sexual activities and bodily functions including ready erections and touching oneself for pleasure of course the parents of this school were particularly outraged somebody leaked it to the press people were upset i'm sure they called the administration and said this is not okay but this isn't the first time she's done this by the way in manhattan she also taught a health and sexuality workshop to juniors at columbia grammar preparatory school in which they all learned about different genres of porn which included gangbang anal and even stepmother porn incestuous type porn that is what happened to 16 year olds when they went to school here's a workshop actually we're going to talk to you about pornography and again the parents were outraged so outraged it got leaked to the press and it caused a fire storm online and you would think this woman would be fired but no they said that she's stepping down but they're proud of the work that justine has done the school has spoken out on behalf of her the parents were not even given a heads up regarding these lessons they drop off their children and this is what's happening and you know the school apologized for not giving them a heads up does that seem okay to you doesn't seem okay to me i hope you guys are enjoying the show so far taking a brief break to remind you guys that the internet which we all use and love is not free in fact our data is constantly

three months free expressvpn.com candice i travel the country a lot as most of you know and it seems to me that the number one question that i am now getting from parents is what can we do they're realizing that something is wrong right you're teaching critical race theory which is really just teaching your children how to be racist they're teaching equitable math which is teaching your children how to be stupid literally teaching children to be stupid and now of course is the hyper sexualization of our children what can we do candice what can we do i'm going to tell you right now what you can do i'm going to actually reverse it and i'm going to ask you a question and that question is what would you do what would you do if you took your child to the playground and they came across another adult and that adult would say he's a male showed your first grader a cartoon about masturbation would you call the administration would you call the people that own the playground and say this is not acceptable is that all you would do that seem okay to you somehow the transferring the same exact thing happening within an institution or a school parents don't know what to do but folks on the playground they would notice they would call the cops because that is a sexual offense children are now being sexually offended in the classroom and parents don't understand that they just they can't comprehend that it doesn't change the crime because it's happening from a teacher in my opinion justine she should have to register as a sexual offender that was my child that would have gone to the police station not to the administration i want you to understand something at this moment in the country our children are under attack they are being preyed upon by the educators they are being preyed upon by people people that have nefarious goals this is a serious issue and a reminder for me you shouldn't be asking me what to do you need to remind yourself that you are the parent we are the parents what would you do in any circumstance that your child is being victimized by other adults i'm a big supporter now of course of home school i think that the schools are a disaster they they cannot be trusted with our children i hear people say well i can't afford to do homeschooling i have to work i understand that predicament it's an obvious predicament that many people are in you have to work so that's why you send your children to school and you say well the school at least it's free it's not free the public school system is not free it is costing you your child's mind it is propaganda it is lies is making them dumber and it is sexualizing them it's a huge trade-off for six hours a day they have your children and they are turning them into whatever it is they desire to turn them into and the answer is not good people that's no longer their goal anymore it's not productive people that's no longer their goal anymore this is something that everybody should be having a serious discussion about and let me tell you regarding homeschool if you think it's hard you should know that our country was based upon that model when the pilgrims arrived at plymouth plymouth rock the moms got together and they sorted things out on a community and a local level one mom said i'll take mondays another mom said i'll take tuesdays i'll take wednesdays thursdays fridays they organized we still have the power to do that we still have the power to organize the government is not the parent we are thanks for joining me on this episode of candace if you

"IeVT33_5t9w": "candace is sponsored by expressvpn your data is your business protect it at expressvpn.com candace hello and welcome to 2022 and to season two of candice i hope that everyone had a wonderful christmas break that the children got all the gifts that they wanted in my house we celebrate boxing day my husband is english and that's actually a thing over there the day after christmas the united kingdom is another bank holiday that's referred to as boxing day it has nothing to do with boxes or even the sport of boxing anymore essentially it's just a day that you spend with neighbors and friends and you eat leftovers it's kind of like a christmas hangover so for our christmas hangover we went to a friend's home and got all the kids together and this particular friend had purchased a pair of oculus goggles for his son do you guys know what i'm talking about maybe you've seen the pictures they are a pair of giant goggles that you wear that allows you to play a video game in a sort of virtual reality that was the pitch at least when they first came out when i tried on these oculus goggles on boxing day i realized that it was something entirely different my experience wasn't a very long one so i put these glasses on and suddenly i'm transported into an elevator and it is incredible how real it looks and it feels and i pressed a button and i went up in the elevator and the elevator opened and i was standing on the top of a building the tiny little ledge and i could hear the people around me in the real universe saying you know just step out into the legend jump off and i went i'm not jumping off of this ledge there's no way i'm jumping off of this ledge i mean i was aware of course that in the universe my my feet were on the ground but seeing is believing so in this reality i was convinced that i was actually on top of a building and they were asking me to jump and i was terrified i was not going to jump off i said i'm not doing this i am not i don't want to do this i tried to inch away my way forward and finally i said nope i'm taking these off and they all kind of laughed at me and then my friend went up next pretty much the same process i don't want to do it i don't want to do it and then my husband thought it would be funny to push my friend of course in the universe just gave him a little push and my friend fell over onto the floor into the universe and screamed ah he was genuinely terrified he took the glasses off and he said he felt like he was actually dying actually thought that he was going to die from this little push and i thought wow someone's actually going to die from a heart attack probably right i mean that's how real everything becomes when you put these goggles on and the person that was hosting us informed us that you actually have to sign a waiver to play because people have already actually died how's that for a game and why am i telling you this because what we're talking about and what i experienced was the coming of the metaverse you've heard about it facebook recently changed their name to meta i mean everybody's talking about the metaverse there was a tract of virtual land that sold for 4.3 million dollars in the metaverse and guess what after this experience i can tell you that that was actually a good investment snoop dogg the rapper has a 17 million dollar nft collection that's a virtual art collection what do you do with virtual art you're probably asking yourselves well you put it in a virtual world in your virtual house on a virtual plot of land the second reason the more important reason i'm telling you this is because it scared me it scared me because i felt in my gut but i had stumbled upon a missing piece of this authoritarian puzzle think about it all of the radical changes that we've experienced in society over the last two years somehow it all just perfectly aligns with the coming of the metaverse social distancing people afraid genuinely afraid to see one another's faces i mean what better solve for that than to only communicate with one another via the metaverse just throw on a pair of goggles and meet up virtually come to my house in the virtual world the never-before-seen national shutdown of schools to combat covid virtual learning established to combat a virus that has an approximate zero percent chance of harming any child children made to exist behind masks anyway well what better priming could there have been for a meta existence soon children are going to be told to stay home put on their goggles and to go to class and they'll be convinced by the way that they are actually in a classroom sitting next to their peers because that's how real it feels behind those goggles only this time their parents aren't going to have to worry about any germs they'll be no need for parents to physically go into work anymore either just throw on a pair of goggles and be immediately transported into your office isolation and more technology what we're talking about what i'm trying to communicate to you is that we are on the brink of transhumanism human beings are becoming the computers i want you to think about that the next time you hear words like biotech biology and technology merging mrna vaccines our dna being fused with technology what we're on the brink of is the next iteration of the world wide web and it should terrify

ever made you might not remember it but I do and I know that all the women are going to feel me is Xenon girl of the 21st century which was on Disney and I was obsessed it was this futuristic movie that had Kirsten storm in it and they had cool songs like zoom zoom zoom make my heart go boom boom my Supernova zoom zoom zoom make my heart go boom boom my Supernova girl What a Wonderful World it was back then when we used to think that the future was something optimistic and now we sort of know it's really scary and dystopian and the state's going to control our children also if I could be in a movie I would it'd probably be honestly as I'm watching all of these ABC there's this like guy Jack Hartman who does kids shows I think I just want to have a kid YouTube channel and I want to teach kids their ABCs and do like Dances Like A is for apple apple", "Ua00hjZpY6E": "this is traumatizing to hear second hand and honestly it's traumatizing to think about this you can only listen to government propaganda wow okay so you had no you have no electricity so you see China yeah and they have light electricity and night time and that's when we thought if we go to China maybe we could find some food to eat that's how why we escaped and how did you get there my sister is here first and she left me a note and she asked me to go find a lady and who's going to help us because in the North Korean border they're like why are electric fences with the machine guns cars standing guarding the border so whole country is a prison and this lady bribed the guards and they helped us to go to China and the reason that she helped us she was selling us to Chinese she was telling you yeah wow so you got sold so you think this might be the dream I'm going to get out of this country and you step into a different kind of a nightmare in China and what was that nightmare like I mean that's NASA arrived in China my mom get raped and I was like 13 years old like that was my introduction to sex and in North Korea we don't even have a sex education so I didn't even know that was the rate it just looked horrible and then they anticipate like people think it's slavery ended somehow it's continuing right now and they thought my mom for 65 and they sold me as a sex slave for less than 300 in this 21st century and they separated me from my mother in China okay and how how long so this is obviously human trafficking um and how long did this go on for almost two years and these were Chinese people yeah Chinese uh so China had one child policy and because of that they are like almost 40 million men cannot find women so they buy these North Korean girls and put them in their brothers and sometimes a village by a one girl and raped hers until she dies and they also get North Korean girls and get our organs out wow so right now there are North Korean like 300 North Korean defectors mostly girls are being sold and raped in under CCP right now wow so you have it's it's like being caught between two communist nightmares you have one group of individuals that are escaping um because of their the Communist nature and they can't survive and they can't eat and then they arrive into another nightmare where you have men that are deprived of sex deprived of women and they're creating another nightmare by sex trafficking and raping women this is this is an absolute nightmare it's caught between two two Hells it's a different planets yes not even yeah and sometimes I cannot believe like the phone in my hand is more expensive than me right and like it's crazy whenever I go this like warm more than looking at this so like puppies have their toys and like puppies have more rights than human beings in North Korea and all these people are going crazy about like animal rights and like do you even know there are how many millions of people don't even know they have human rights right and this is uh interesting the world that we are living in right now so how did this this sex trafficking nightmare end for you how did you break free of this this second prison that you were in I was rescued by Christians so there are Christians coming from South Korea and they literally risked their life because China the North Korea sends agent to snap and kill them assassinate them and trying to put them in their life sentence so this mission is comes and set up a shelter house and rescue these girls from human traffickers and once we are there we study Bible and then that's when they told us you can go to South Korea and ask them like how can we go to South Korea we don't have passport you literally have to walk across a frozen coffee Desert from China to Mongolia and if you make it and if you don't die from cold and eaten by animals then you can go to South Korea so that's what I did in 2009 when I was 15 years old we'll get back to the show in a moment but first I need to talk to you about where you're buying your meat since 2015 over 100 000 independent farms and

talking about you know we are we need to be the liberal leaders in the world and you are telling me the story about something very real the governments could help but make an impact on uh they could send in troops you know try to stop this sex trafficking that's going on in China rather than that they're doing deals with China they're helping to enrich China and the people that are saving you are not people from government organizations which take trillions of dollars from individuals um but Christians yeah who are persecuted by governments yeah and the pastor who rescued me in the missions who were asking me some got care then in the lifetime prison in China right now so they risk their lives some of them alive and some of them died wow how long did it take you to to Traverse through Mongolia how long did it take for you to get there and where was your mother a part of this story at this point I found my mom back it was a long journey I found that I lost her and she had to be sold again and in this journey we had eight people we had a one young baby boy and I was 15 and other people mostly women and we had one compass in our hand and they literally say go follow the north and west Direction and crossed like eight wire fences so if you don't get electrified from wire fences and get shot you make it and we did it so it took one day of course but it was like minus 40 degrees in February 2009 so the guards though like nobody's crazy enough to cross desert right now in this freezing court so that helped us to not get discovered by the guards wow wow so you made it to Mongolia and then what you got nothing then they put us in the detention center and then they eventually helped us to go to South Korea and it's interesting America has opened the door for all other refugees but not that to North Koreans even then so so far actually about 200 North Korean defectors made it to America over the last 80 years last 80 years yeah and we've got about 2 million that have already come from the southern border this last year yeah and we just can't make time to help anybody anymore no somebody don't want North Koreans right and and many people that are coming in by the way are not in these circumstances at all they just go people are promising Us free stuff in fact ironically they're falling for the same lies that once took place in North Korea we're going to give you free this we're going to give you free that when in reality the goal seems to just be we want we want to take more power for the government it's like nothing is free how come it's free like nobody nothing is free yeah a lot of people believe it can be free yeah because of indoctrination they can just wave a magic wand and things can be given to them yeah this is I mean I guess I have to ask this question how did you keep going I mean how did you find within yourself you're 15 years old I mean you've seen more horror and more trauma than most people ever experienced an entire lifetime right what was it inside of you that made you keep going oh I think this is very interesting even though my father didn't have education like in America it's all about like oh if that's how you feel like it's legitimate as I think like they're almost like like a safe space emotional feelings but my father told me as a younger it's like there's a toy like the two round things if you knock it off it comes back knock it over comes back and he always told me you gotta be like that resilient no matter how hard life hits you gotta come back up so I think that value he understood me really kept me going so it's the exact opposite value system that we're kind of raising up American children with which is that every single feeling that you have matters it's it's valid you should collapse every time something bad happens to you you erase the exact opposite in the exact opposite manner yeah and you've somehow survived so much yeah so how did you come to America what was what was your story here I know I wish so I had to come to America as a South Korean Citizen and the fact that I couldn't pay taxes and so I had to call me that's a very long process of paperwork with the lawyers so that's how it came by I came to Indonesia to write my book my first book and then I went to Columbia University in New York so that's how I came like almost five years ago and are you are you a citizen here no I fight for citizenship and they said to hear back from them takes the 18 to 11 months wow to hear back from them wow oh my God it's like like 15th century or something yeah well they're a little tied up because they're just allowing everyone in at the border I think at the moment so we might be a little backed up in the process um it must be totally insane for you to step into America to be here you said for five years to see this life to see electricity you know to see the way people are living to hear about them talking about oppressions but also what does this all mean to you in terms of the government I mean in the in the era of covid in the era of we're going to help you we just need to take away your freedoms like can you put this into context for Americans uh how it makes you feel I think it is exactly like history repeating and stuff right now right like North Korea came almost this is what shocked me for me as a North Korean when they said there's an inequality in America it's like Hallelujah that means you can rise just above somebody else because there's no inequality in North Korea everybody's dirty poor and in America they're like inequalities that's something the worst thing that can ever happen and for me it's like poverty is something that is the worst thing can happen right inequality means somebody can become a billionaire they can start SpaceX they can start companies it means there's economic Mobility exactly it's but like in America somehow people are so like brainwashed I don't even know but they say look at us we have homeless like that's great you have freedom to even homeless and they're like look at us you have any card amazing how amazing is that so that's why it's like almost and I was like actually at Columbia at the orientation I was like is this a North Korean classroom because in North Korea they literally say like American bastards the one word by the way and they say American bastards okay so they say oh because of American bastards we don't have electricity because of American bastards we are very poor and at Colombia it's like oh because of white men we mess up Africa because of white men we have a climate change because American like the founding fathers who have all these problems the anti-American that sentiment was even stronger than what North Korean classroom teaches us wow so I was like wow I guess Kim don't get stored it's like you know handbook curriculum from American University at this point very much yes copying the professors yeah wow wow that is incredible thanks

exciting you know i've always thought that fashion police was where the show needs to go uh so we guess we can take a look at some of the outfits last night they were really just objectively all bad um i i don't know if the grammys is considered the high night of fashion but it definitely missed the mark okay first up we have justin bieber and he looks like jared from subway who has lost a lot of weight and wants people to know about it his wife looks absolutely lovely she looks classy and beautiful which makes this especially potent also strangely he looks like the goomba this is such a specific thing but if you ever watch the super mario brothers movie there were goombas that stood in the elevator and just rocked back and forth like this and that is exactly what justin bieber looks like next up who do we have chrissy teigen i'm not too offended by this outfit i know i'm supposed to be offended because me and christine notoriously do not get along but you know yes does she look like a tissue paper when you buy a gift from hallmark a little bit but not bad for the grammy so i'm going to leave her alone i think she looks fine billy eilish in a funeral procession and funerals are to be taken seriously so i'm not going to say anything offensive about her it's just this is not a good look at all i just don't know what they're thinking i don't know what conversations they're having with their stylists about what they're channeling on um the red carpet but whatever she's channeling is very sad she's mourning something and it should be respected next oh this is like she looks at the top of a christmas tree i like this this makes me happy it makes me want christmas so tiffany ish legit looks like the ornament at the top the star at the top of a christmas tree if that's what she was going for she nailed it next okay now i think that mario was a theme because this is obviously the last boss in mario that's bowser um my producers tell me she says that she was a cactus but you guys have to come on that's literally bowser from mario i won the game when i was a kid i had a great child i had a great childhood that is all taylor parks you nailed that as bowser hey guys i want to take a moment to talk to you about expressvpn think about how much of your life is on the internet sadly every site you visit video you watch or message that you send gets tracked and data mined when you run express you pay on your device the software hides your ip address something big tech can use to personally identify you so expressvpn makes your activity harder to trace and sell to advertisers especially pn also encrypts 100 of your internet data to keep you safe from hackers and eavesdroppers that are on your network and expressvpn does all of this without slowing your connection that's why it's rated the number one vpn service by mashable and techradar it's super easy to use even if you aren't tech savvy you literally just download the app on your phone tap one button and then you're protected so stop handing over your personal dash to the big tech monopoly that mind your activity and sells your information protect yourself with the vpn that i trust to keep me safe online visit expressvpn.com candice that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com candice to get three extra months free go to expressvpn.com candace right now to learn more what's the most liberal thing you have agreed on um everything liberal because i use i used to be liberal i mean and i very much follow that timeline of when you're young you're liberal because you have a big heart and then when you're older you become more conservative because you have a brain so i used to buy into all of the garbage i was pro-feminist believe in the patriarchy's existence i was pro-abortion my body my choice i mean i wasn't active so i was never an activist you're never gonna find old videos or pictures of candace marching through a protest and wearing a hat but i just believed in those perspectives because those were the ones that i was informed upon in my childhood and that is why i consistently say that we need to take back the education system it's intentionally creating little marxists who vote for progressives because they believe that it's the moral thing to do and these people tend to come out of school with entirely no sense and entirely no direction in terms of how to function in the real world next question candace do you plan on writing and creating for dw kids would love if you did absolutely actually i feel like dw may have followed me in this direction because i have been really kind of honing in on the childhood stuff long before disney got creepy it's just kind of what happens naturally when you become a mother and one of my dreams is actually to write a childhood series like i loved when i was a kid spot the dog and i would always have to get the next series a book and spot the dog so i want to create a similar series and i would probably name it after my children and talk about all the various things that really small children go through that's not creepy just the simple stuff that parents like to read to their parents read to their children at bedtime so i would love to be a part of that process as an author next question is it okay for men to cry no just kidding is it is it okay for men to cry when going through a mental health problem or a death of course it's okay for men to cry when they're going through things when i talk about the circumstance of men crying and and saying that it actually disgusts me i'm talking about this weird perverse society now where men constantly need to talk about their emotions on tv you know this new prince harry type of person who is on national television sitting down you know crying humming and talking about how this is what it really means to be a man no this is what it really means to be a narcissist that's looking for people to tell them that they don't know strangers on the internet to tell them how brave they are and courageous they are because they're crying with the camera on their face they're not brave or courageous and it's just a way for them to get those internet highs that people get it's a way for them to go oh wow dopamine hit to the brain because all of these millions of people are saying how amazing i am because i'm crying on the internet and that is so fake to me uh you know i believe that certain conversations and certain emotions and feelings should be reserved for the people that are around you and love you and know you and now that we've made a spectacle of that and men increasingly being told that every feeling that they have is valid it's not neither for women not every feeling you have is valid not every feeling you have needs to be shared needs to stop so that we can kind of go toward a more austere society if you're like me you're probably in front of a screen for a lot of your day and are probably all too familiar with the eye strain and headaches that come along with them whether it's answering emails scrolling through instagram or reading the latest news stories screens are inescapable but luckily with the blue blocks the

expose it why aren't the big media conglomerates exposing this how does what does the government stand to benefit from not actually looking at what is a real epidemic and a crisis in this country i mean obviously there's a lot of people that benefit from the money that's being spent if you actually solve the problem and i point out that countries like the netherlands japan germany i mean basically every civilized nation has solved this we're not a civilized nation as long as we allow this to go on they when you solve the problem then you have a whole bunch of people that don't get their money they don't get those contracts they don't get their work so it will always be expensive to take care of people with serious mental illness people with schizophrenia but these young men here you saw in their early 30s they look like they're in their 50s those guys just need they need rehab they need mandated rehab as an alternative to jail or prison and they should be out there living an independent life reaffiliating with family and friends going back to work for them it shouldn't be a chronic condition treated with palliative care they should be getting the rehab that they need and i think right there is where you hit at something that's the most important is that there's no money in the solution if you can extract 13 billion dollars every two years and saying that we're fighting this issue you know just as a business person you want the issue to get bigger you don't ever want it to end and i speak a lot about how why we keep talking about race issues it seems never ending it's the social justice the pursuit of you know solving racism you know the pursuit of solving uh drug issues nothing ever actually gets solved and yet they just keep punting it and earning themselves more money so i think in the in these circumstances uh the government is the enemy of the people because they don't actually want to help the people um and it's sad to see this and i think that man is speaking to that a little bit that he believes the government wants to see more of this yeah he said yeah the african-american man he goes this is all for them so we've spent all this money basically help creating sickness on the streets the big lie is that the addicts and the people suffering mental illness on the streets are there because they can afford the rent well that's probably true but they couldn't afford the rent because they use all their money for their drug habit and they've stopped working so the way it works is that by spending 500 000 to a million dollars per housing unit that money then is kicked back into mostly democratic party uh politicians who then raise that money for their campaigns and that's how the system works that's why they spend so much money on housing and we haven't funded the basic safe and clean shelter that's required housing should be something earned for good behavior shelter is what we provide to people when they're desperate and down on their luck that's right and poor government incentivization is something that i speak about a lot i do want to cut to this next video of you know this man describing his lifestyle as a homeless drug addict in san francisco which i think is really telling if you're gonna be homeless it's pretty easy here i mean if we're gonna be realistic to pay you to be homeless here when you said that san francisco pays people to be homeless what did you mean by that you mean that literally yeah i mean i get 620 bucks a month dude from general assistance or would you how was that hard to get phone call bro wow phone call 200 food stamps and 620 bucks cash a month wow forget about it why wouldn't i do it you know free money dude this right now is literally by choice literally by choice like why would i want to pay rent i'm not doing i got a cell phone that i have amazon prime and netflix on we used to battle with the cops now it's like the cops are it's like they're your neighbor you know the cops told us uh this morning like oh it'd be easier if you guys packed up in the morning we wouldn't have to come out here and i'm like what are you talking about he's like back up in the morning i'm like why you know he's like oh okay and then went on i'm actually speechless yeah it's it was a shocking experience to film it because it's what you know but it's it's what's different now is how much more open the street addicts are and he goes on to say that he sold fentanyl to two teenagers a 15 and a 16 year old and showed them how to use it so on the way i really am horrified by james who i'm also grateful to him that he felt so bold as to actually be so honest with me um just going right up to him but i think it shows how much there is no law and order in san francisco it's a dangerous place to be i don't think it's safe for people people sometimes like to visit there i don't think it's safe for people to visit your car is going to be broken into you could get assaulted we're seeing increased huge amounts of violence against people 100 increase in homicides in los angeles over the last couple of years so it's a it's a it's a wild west situation out there it needs

get to hear directly from you guys at home and answer some of your questions so let's dive right in question number one quick your house is on fire you and your family are safe what would you grab i guess we're not safe if i'm grabbing something out of the house um it's an interesting question i would probably grab my granddad's hat would definitely be the item that i would grab i didn't take anything like personal belongings um when my grandfather uh passed and they emptied out his house but i did take his hat because he always wore a sick like a signature hat he loved hats that was the greatest gift you could get him whenever you traveled he say oh baby could you please get me a hat could you please just grab me a hat from wherever you are whether you're traveling throughout europe he just had a large collection of hats so i have a hat from him that's from st thomas and it just means a lot so that would be the item that i would grab question number two how do i respond to someone who justifies abortion by using instances of rape and incest uh that's a very good question and you will realize that the left always has to argue in extremes because they know that it does not validate um their arguments to our to argue with the majority so here's pretty much how you look at the incidents first off ask them a question it's always good when you're arguing to see what knowledge they have and the first question i would ask them is how many pregnancies um are derived from rape instances and get the answer from them it's obviously going to be very low and then you say do you believe that that justifies the slaughter of this many million babies that's taking place every year do you think that that justifies the slaughter of 19 million other babies the majorities of these circumstances are not happening because people are being raped obviously it's happening because people are irresponsible and people are starting to look at abortion as a birth control mechanism and of course the answer to that question is absolutely not does not justify it beyond that i would point them to an example of a rape victim who went and on to have their child there are many of these children speaking out saying i am the product of rape and i have a right to live too and it's very good for them to be able to hear that perspective i find a lot of time so the issue surrounding the debate of abortion is that people don't even hear the other side of the arguments they don't hear from the woman who got an abortion and there's so many of them and are going to cover it on another episode who regret their decision it's not just the child that is being murdered that is suffering this horrible trauma of being ripped from its mother's womb but it's also the woman that's having their room being ripped out uh that is not their wound being ripped out but having the child being ripped out of the womb that suffer from psychological long-term issues i have always said to those women they feel like they can't speak out they can speak out and they become the biggest voices for the pro-life movement and i would say the same for children who are the product of rape they can become the largest and the loudest voices for the pro-life movement so i would find those many voices on the internet and i would present them to your friend and say how could you argue when this person is saying that they have a right to live that actually they didn't we'll be right back to the show in just a moment but first have you ever read the fine print that appears on your computer or phone when you start browsing in incognito mode it says that your activity might still be visible to your employer your school or your internet service provider how can they even call that incognito

candice to learn more next question how is your garden doing do you plan to preserve your harvest i'm so excited about my garden this is the first year that i am planting vegetables i've decided that i have to learn to actually grow food because otherwise you are dependent on the government if you do not know how to grow your own food you think that it comes from the grocery store you're probably going to be a person that suffers tremendously when we start having food shortages which we are already having so i have planted tons of stuff i've planted arugula onions tomatoes carrots watermelons i feel like it'd be really fun to just have like a patch of watermelons and i already see it spring up because tennessee soil is so fertile i will obviously be harvesting it i'm going to eat it i'm going to preserve it i'm going to use every single piece of the fruit and the vegetables and then i'm going to compost them i really am turning into a true farmer which is conveniently my married last

since Octavian after Caesar Augustus everything has gone to to rot in Italy right now you cannot work in Italy unless you prove that you have taken the vaccine and I want to be clear about what I'm not saying you can't work for the government I'm not saying you can't work in a school you can't work public or private this is starting next week you will be sent home unpaid and potentially fined over Seventeen hundred dollars this is insane and when you look by the way at the effectiveness of these mandates notice that Italy is in a worse position than we are on this virus Italy it does not have a great record on on government on the protection of Rights on efficiency and so it would seem to me that this is just another example of of a long poorly run political system here in Italy and if we don't watch out it's coming here too we will be back to the show in just a moment but first we need to talk about how you can be saving a lot of money on your phone bill customers are abandoning Verizon 18t and T-Mobile's overpriced Wireless plans hundreds of thousands of smart families are saving over 800 a year by switching to pure talk without having to sacrifice great coverage why because

have these these Mass layoffs happening nurses are being laid off the heroes yesterday are now the villains today Nurses Mass layoffs they don't care they're doing this all you know Australia everywhere a government obviously wants to make money presumably they want to be able to tax us right presumably they want tax revenue so why are they crippling the economy why are they sinking their own economies why are they creating all this disruption like what is actually happening on a global level because I am not buying that there is any legitimate fear of you know for this virus by the government I'm also not buying that even if there was limit for that they would care if we all perish they'd be off somewhere underground you know protecting themselves and carrying on the human race without all of us right so the government does not care about you if you think that the government cares about you you need you know you got to start from the very beginning like kindergarten start from the beginning right that's not what governments are for so what what are they after here power control profit but no profit here no profit it's worth it pointing out on the realm of profit this covid lockdown represents the largest transfer of wealth from the lower and middle class to the upper class possibly in recorded history right right and the fastest and the fastest and the fastest but it's not sustainable but right because once everyone's vaccinated that's that's finite once everyone's vaccinated I mean I guess you could just keep saying and you need to keep getting vaccinated x amount of time I mean in Israel now you're not fully vexed unless you've had three yeah so as of Sunday the Sunday just gone in Israel if you've only had two shots you you've lost your green pass so you now can no longer go to your restaurants gyms Cinemas what happens do they just take the app off your phone or like you have to hand it back in like how does this work it expires right because the it I mean I don't know how long the vaccine-induced immunity goes on for there's a lot of things we don't know um but we know that it wanes and so just like a flu a flu jab right people have to get them every year there's going to be new variants so this is a subscription model okay so as a business owner you know there's nothing more profitable than a subscription model yeah so if you can get people taking these shots every six months or every 12 months for the rest of their lives get the children on it early then then that's what it is and then you can if you're able to control people's movements and also when people uh I mean you saw this last year what happens when people lose their jobs or their businesses fail Etc who do they look to to rely on the government right so again it's just it's soft communism as far as I'm concerned we'll get back to the show in a second but first we need to talk about protecting your family memories every day VCRs and film projectors get harder to

legacybox.com canis to save 40 off legacybox.com Candace with Communism again like great for the government to the beginning but eventually you run out of everybody else's money and you have a state where they can't so I just don't understand the long-term goal of this globally it seems that the okay it's almost like to me it's a transfer of wealth yeah to an elite group but also like everything has been so beneficial to China that it's just been incredible to take a look back and just say okay apparently this virus came from China made in a lab perhaps it seems pretty obvious that this just came out that like you know there were tons of plans and they moved papers around in this Wuhan lab but we can't talk about that or it'll be a conspiracy theorist even though like the proof is literally right there in the pudding you can go on TV all the time yeah and by the way you don't need to be a crazy conspiracy theorist to point out that this is the culmination of a long-standing trend in American politics for decades and decades and decades now we have believed that you can spend whatever you want do whatever you want get whatever you want without ever paying the bill you can have wars and you don't need to pay for them you can send people home from work for a year and not pay for it and don't worry the Bill's never going to come due and what I think will surprise the them is that eventually the bill does come due because there's no such thing in this world as a free lunch but our ruling class I don't think understands that it is incredible I mean they may understand it I just don't know if they care I mean why is communism been tried and failed so many times I mean just in the past one century I mean you've had how many different iterations of the same failed idea with the same consequences people dying people getting murdered people starving and yet to this day right now even in your country there are people who want to repeat that again right and again and again and again and there's something really strange about how some of these ideas are they're like zombies they won't they won't just die so even if they logically don't make sense and you can see you know second third fourth order consequences what happens you've got people who are in power who perhaps you know I don't give them too much credit in many cases I think you know some of these people are just bad people so it's hard to understand well you know this reminds me of Whitaker Chambers former Communists said that communism is not a new ideology It's the Great alternative faith of mankind that began in the Garden of Eden when the serpent said ye shall be his gods and and I think that that moment was the first great reset in in American history and I think that impulse to totally re remake the world I think that bubbles up among very dangerous radicals yeah and I think this is one thing is that if you are a decent insane person which the vast majority of people are is it's incredibly hard to understand the motives and the thinking of somebody who's not right yeah because we generally project and think okay most people we know that most people mean well right so we project that onto others but there are people and there are people in power who do not care about Humanity they don't care about me they don't care about you they don't care if you lose your job your business gets crushed they don't they don't care if it serves them and their motives and their goals and their power and their money and whatever they genuinely do not care and I don't I think that's a very small number of people but it's enough people and if they're in positions of power it's enough to cause a lot of damage thanks for joining me on this segment of Candace if you like this video

beyond that i guess he's just he's rich so that's strike one and strike two is he's got he's got a mind of his own and um and i think that's it that's he's got a mind of zone he's rich and that's that's it that's that's the major sin yeah when did he get on the the leftist bad list when did that happen you know i think it's when they they don't know what side he's on so you know when he's out there being outspoken they they hate these big domineering men that are just so smart and you know that they can't control him right that's exactly right it comes down to control because whenever they hate someone and there doesn't seem to be a reason it simply says to me that they can't control him and i think what what they when they started hating him a lot was when he had that tweet a while ago when he did back-to-back pcr tests and one was negative positive negative positive and that's all he said he didn't say that there's something wrong with test but he just said hey i just did this it was a controlled setting one said negative one said positive can somebody please explain this and i feel like since then they were like elon musk cannot be controlled he's not putting his arm in a photo on instagram and saying i just got vaccinated and you should too right and they don't like him i hope you're enjoying the show so far and i'm afraid to say it but at this very moment it is

incredible that they can wow they seem to be able to work in nazi no matter what it's like so now they're literally trying to blast individuals with autism with health physical issues yeah nobody's off limits nobody's off limits and if this was anybody else's disability announced on stage if they had a disability what would the reaction have been well i think i mean he's also an african-american man so he is literally yeah he's literally literally is so that's another reason i actually love thinking about elon musk as an african-american man he yeah and he's an immigrant yeah that's exactly right yeah disabled african american he checks all the ideas he should be at the top of the progressive stack and yet they absolutely hate him thanks for joining me on this episode of candace if you

"[Applause] all right guys i am honored to introduce you to my next guest he is the founder and president of operation underground railroad incredible organization that rescues children from sex trafficking and sexual exploitation please give a hand for tim ballard thank you oh okay so i'm gonna just give my audience a little bit of a background so i sat down with you a little over a year ago and it was one of the most rewarding conversations i ever had i will say is the only time that i almost completely broke down on camera um and over really my own ignorance i would say so as i'm gonna try to do this as slow as possible i know that we don't have as much time as we had then i just first want you to start with your story because i think that's an incredible place to start of what got you interested um in this sex trafficking operation starting these stings trying to expose these people start us right there sure so i started my career as a special agent and undercover operator for the department of homeland security mostly on the border for 10 years working sex trafficking cases and about 12 years into that recognized that there was these major gaps in so many of our neighboring countries that were also affecting our sex trade here in the united states we're the number one consumers of child sex material in the world but so many of our neighboring countries didn't have the resources and i started working some cases overseas for the us government where i got kind of in deeper than i should have probably in an undercover capacity and decided that the only way i could stay to work these cases because they weren't technically u.s cases was to quit my job it was really my wife who said you got to quit if you can help these kids you're overseas and they're saying you know that there's sex trafficking going on and the u.s government is saying to you sorry uh on not your turf you can't do anything exactly what happened exactly what happened and i had all this intel and i'd seen the kids and i was they'd made me the bait we were hunting for american tourists which would be u.s business but if i didn't find the u.s tourist we did find the children and and these are little kids and sometimes as young as 7 years old up to 14 15 and so i call home my wife i'm like what what do we do you know i they're calling me back check you quit quit and let's just let's just do this um i got some help from glenn beck who i called on a whim and he got me money and we started operation underground railroad i hope you are enjoying the show just a brief break to

it's too late i just want you to recap the story because was that your first opera first operation talk about that so we learned about uh a a trafficking organization that was taking children so after the earthquake in 2010 there are about half a million orphans made overnight wandering the streets and this is when the traffickers come in after a kind of a national a natural disaster like that it's harvest time for the traffickers they come in and they throw signs up over their walls orphanage here orphanage there and innocent people are driving these children into what they think is a safe haven in fact it's traffickers and so we got a lead on that and there was children between one years old up to about 13 and the police asked us to go undercover pretending to be buyers from from the united states and so we went in and they said just if they offer you kids just just buy one and i walk into this place and they're just selling kids like like like chilled like puppies like animals you know they're 15 000 each and and this is where pedophiles come this is where child pornographers come it's where slave labor comes to get these children and so i've got to pick a kid and and before i can even pick this a child this beautiful two-year-old boy turns and walks to me as if he knew something as i felt i picked him up in my arms and he ended up having a an older sister who was about three and so i i got them together and and told them that stay with me i'm gonna buy you but not really i actually revealed who i was to them because i felt it in the moment so you described the three-year-old girl um when she first saw you you remember when you told me yes i want to talk about that yeah i think that's so incredible so i'm holding the little boy in my arms and i walk into these out buildings because i'm looking for other kids i have a i have camera undercover my my backpack and as i'm walking in i the deeper i get into this building and the darker it gets the quieter it gets only then can i hear what was always behind me the footsteps of this other little girl this three-year-old this beautiful child and i turn around and she's looking at me like pissed like just with like courageous but like pissed off eyes you know like what what are you doing and i look at her and i give her a candy bar so get out of here you're gonna yell and blow my cover you know and i give her this candy bar and she and she's supposed to take it outside and eat it like most kids would do when in that circumstance instead almost like muscle memory this brave little girl breaks the candy bar in half and places the other half of it into the arms of the little boy in my arms and it's just it's like god just told me in that moment this is her little brother and how many americans have come to this place picked up a child and that child's gone and she's not gonna let that happen so that's what prompted me to i knelt down i put the kid down she grabs him and puts him behind her i think she's gonna block i mean just brave as can be i'm like 10 times her size and i kneel down and take her hands and tell her who i am no one was around luckily and i and i said we're i'm gonna help you guys and you'll never be apart again these two kids and and so we ended up going back to the traffickers and we ended up buying both of them in the sting operation which gave police the evidence they needed to then raid the place and get the other 26 children out and into safety um and just really bonded with these kids really just in awe of the courage of this little girl and i'm that night i'm calling i'm talking to my wife on the phone like telling her what happened and my wife gets very emotional and says i want to be their mother if you can't find their mother let me be their mother and i said are you crazy we just quit our job we have no money this is really expensive and and that she persisted and so i dutifully obeyed and uh those kids are now home they're our children it's just amazing story it really is i'm still still trying not to cry because it just is just such a powerful story hey guys we are going to take a small break to discuss if you are a

at the top of the homepage and type in candice that's stamps.com promo code candace stamps.com never go to the post office again what is curious to me is that you went in as americans and that didn't send any red flags like oh the americans are the good guys this is probably a sing operation and so what you're saying is that they're used to seeing americans and that's an okay and acceptable person to see and you particularly brought up you know the pornography industry and before speaking with you i think i was probably agnostic maybe libertarian and like you know some people watch porn some people don't not really my business no harm no foul and you really made me understand that there's a lot of foul and despite the like we are the number one consumers in america um of the pornography that allows and keeps this human sex trafficking alive you stated it so much more eloquently so please do yeah with the united states we're the number one consumers of child rape videos child exploitation material which is why these governments around the world in haiti and other places ask us to come in and be informants we always work with governments we're not a vigilante group but they ask us because they say you look like the clients the traffickers are trying to service and we can get into the belly of the beast pretty quick because of just how we look right and and it really does reflect the the the the peace that united states has in this problem because sometimes we say this is far away from us well it's happening right here first of all i mean thousands of kids are being brought across the border into sex trafficking and it's happening here but more importantly i think we are the demand and so when you talk about creating safe zones for sexuality like we talked about the legalizing sex work which has been proposed in new york state and other places uh and in several countries in europe well what it does because i'm libertarian too but what that does to normalize that activity these people who are going to pimp out the adult sex workers they they are protected under these rules too and so now they're shaking hands with government officials they're certified they're licensed they're paying taxes and everything's great except they never show you the stable of 12 kids who are 10 years old who are in the back room or scattered across a dozen hotels in amsterdam or wherever and now they're safe because no one's going to watch them anymore because they're good guys they're businessmen and now these kids are stuck in hell and so that's why we can't normalize the sexuality of of of of anything we have to fight against that culture so that we can protect children right i think that those are such powerful words for people to understand we are the demand we are the demand we're creating this problem and i think yeah the libertarian perspective is live and let live as long as it's not harming anybody and in this circumstance what you're saying is it it really does harm people and those people that are charming especially are children thanks for joining me on this episode of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel

has miss usa 2005 a successful entrepreneur and most importantly a mother of two please welcome chelsea cooley okay so this is quite the story and one that i am interested in obviously having young kids um you at the time you had an 11 year old now that that your girl is 12 but at the time you found your 11 year old daughter and she didn't find her filling out the survey actually she came to you and she told you about a survey that she was filling out in school is that correct yes so actually through our school they let us know that a title ix survey was going to be given to the students so i reached out to the school to see if i could just review it i want to know if you're giving something to my child i want to be able to see it they did not have the survey at that time so they sent me to our title 9 director now by law by our family educational rights and privacy act as a parent i have the right to ask and to review the information so when i emailed jerrell lewis our title ix uh director he said that he was not at liberty to give me the survey and sent me on a wild goose chase to their public meeting that i could review from months prior so i spent three hours digging through this meeting tape to find just what she was going to be talking about it was a sexual abuse awareness survey basically and so that's where my concern live because i thought why aren't you giving me the information and in the email he was saying you know it's already been reviewed it's already been approved i'm not asking to dispute it i'm just asking to see it as a parent so this is like a no-brainer hey i see that you guys are going to be handing out title 9 survey can i see it and we actually do have the email um that i actually want to show the email that they wrote back to you because i find the language i mean this is obviously hey you saw the newsletter can i see it the language of what he wrote back to you is quite strange if you would like to view the survey you can do so with an administrator at your child's school or at central office like unfortunately we are not able to provide a copy of this survey to you directly you're the mom they are telling you they're going to give this survey to your child but they are not at liberty to give the survey to you directly just to your child directly that's immediately alarming and it allows them to have again control over children because most parents should not stay at home most parents don't have time to go visit the school's central office to be given something that is directly being given to their child so it's already a wild goose hunt that is a basic google doc form right that is not hard to create send share they sent me back to the school which the school didn't even have it in their possession yet because it was being distributed by the district and upon reading it you know here's how you actually get it i had to dive through their public meeting form it took me almost three hours to dig through it of course it was in the last 10 minutes of the video to see what she was being given so that she and i could discuss it because at the time she was 11 years old and in it she said mom why are they asking me my gender there were seven or eight different options we have a we have a little still of that we had to also claw through the footage and find it because they've removed it so this is these are just some of the options that we're going to be giving to your 11 year old on the forum what is your gender you can pick female and male that makes sense then you can pick transgender female to trans feminine transgender male to trans masculine non-binary gender queer gender fluid you can pick two spirits or you can prefer not to say i mean i would have failed this test immediately because i don't know what any of that is i don't even know what is two-spirit for the sake of the audience i have tried to decipher what i have found through my google research and even i have some very close friends that are lumbee indian and i have asked them and they have no idea so it is something pertaining to native americans in regards to their gender and i still cannot decipher exactly what it is but your 11 year old is supposed to be able to decipher that and you're not supposed to know that your 11 year old is deciphering that i'm sure in class they were going to explain the options but you're at the office and they can't give it to you because they don't have it just yet and your email they can't give to you directly so you kind of understand what's happening it's a bit of smoke and mirrors right when you saw this form how did you feel i was really concerned because it's giving her information to be curious about something that at her age at 11 years old should not be on the spectrum of things that she's concerned about in addition to that it's a sexual abuse awareness whistleblower type of form and it's giving different examples of what could be sexual assault and it's talking about you know has anyone shared any pornographic material and okay she doesn't know what pornographic material is nor am i going to explain that to her so she's filling out a form that she doesn't even begin to understand and so without her parents being there being aware of it really exactly because the idea was to sort of slip this in hey we're going to be giving out a form and hope that no parents were going to call and inquire about it so that those natural questions that she may have turned to you and said i don't what does it mean to be sexually harassed what does this all this stuff mean are instead going to her teacher and they're able to curate that relationship and that establish that trust and that is not a good thing when you're talking about adults that are that are foreign to your children we are all staring at screens every single day and we know the horrible side effects that you get from that for me i get headaches i swear my right eyesight is deteriorating you get the digital eye strain the watery eyes the fatigue it's all so bad but there is a solution and the solution is blue blocks blue light computer glasses i love these glasses they

to save 20 i do want to show also that the sexual harassment uh portion again an 11 year old so this is pre-pubescent does your high school uh during your ch your high school years have you engaged in behavior that could be considered sexual harassment yes or no if you answered yes to the question above how often have you engaged in behavior that could be considered sexual harassment um again rarely sometimes often i've never engaged in behavior that could be considered sexual why are they asking 11 year olds if they're sexually harassing other people right and they say in the beginning of the meeting one of the school board members explicitly said this is going to be anonymous but yet they have to the child has to put their school assigned email address in there so why in the second half of this are you even asking a child well are you the one doing the sexual assault it makes absolute no sense and i cannot understand how it would bring them to a positive result for whatever it is that they're trying to seek in regards to sexual abuse claims what it's really about and this is why i always encourage my listeners to read the thomas soul book inside the education system because he talks about how these forms are being giving out usually under the guise of health you know health education and uh what's really happening is it's meant to fracture the relationship between the parent and the child and to make them believe that they have a more trusting relationship and a more honest relationship with the teachers in the classroom and your parents don't get this but we do you can confide in us you can tell us what's going on inside of your household we're going to be the ones that guide you not your parents at home and of course most parents are at work most most parents um are single or single parents you're a single parent right right and and good on you to have had the time but how much pressure that is for a single parent right to simultaneously work plus be paying attention to these small little details like oh we'll be handing out some title nine forms right and and so you did and so you then stumbled upon was this eight that the title nine um session that they had and this was between the educators board of educators and they're speaking about you know what are the sorts of rights that these that these students have which to me is stunning i don't know what sorts of rights students are supposed to have outside of their households right my mom would have said you get no rights because exactly this is my house i pay the bills i clothe you i house you you get to eat and sleep for free i make the rules that is how i raise my children that's how i was raised in a single parent home you know it's interesting because i had a former educator just last week send me some information about this title ix committee meeting that took place in october of 2020. and so of course everything by law has to be recorded it is public knowledge for us to go back and review these meetings and this is where i'm assuming you're referring to the gender plan support system has been put in place where just like you're saying they are slowly trying to fracture that relationship between us as parents and our children and so the information that was brought to me was beyond alarming because if if they're creating a support system and we can dive more into that about you know how they're going to support a student who may want to change their gender and they may or may not on a case-by-case basis decide if and what they're going to share with parents okay you interchange whatever that issue is if we don't stand up now for our rights as parents pretty soon we as parents as a whole will have no rights thanks for joining me on this segment of

it because it was so one-sided you know as a history teacher i have no problem with bringing in different angles as long as it's balanced and you have kind of counter approaches and students get to decide but none of this stuff is ever done in that way it's always presented very much as like here's kind of the argument that's been made prove that the argument's true so students would be tasked with coming into class and they'd say show how systemic racism manifests in the schools not does it or not you know there's no inquiry-based model so a lot of times i felt like with the 1619 project is they they set up these arguments for students and students therefore are tasked with proving kind of the uh the message that they want them to prove which is not critical thinking at all it's indoctrination and the hyper racialized environment is something of interest you know i have uh people that i use cenanity for telling me that in new york city you know they have to take their force to take these multicultural classes and what's kind of inside of them as you sit around and you say you guys are oppressors and you guys are the victims and one thing that really shocked me was that she said that during black history month they encouraged they all had to go to the assembly room and they all the black kids were allowed to get on stage and to shout at all of the white kids and say like what they've lived through their lived experiences as a black person that to me is genuinely unimaginable like i grew up in the 90s we didn't have these feelings against your white versus black and the idea of me standing on a stage and yelling at someone for being white and having that be encouraged is is scary because what kind of world does that present into the future exactly that was my biggest concern where i really felt the need to speak out is thinking where this takes us long term students are really you know young people in general are programmed i think to think kind of in primary colors like they want to see the world very black and white because they're teenagers and so when you bring in an ideology that kind of lays that out for them like hey here's a really easy way to understand a complex world oppressor oppressed black white uh privileged um underprivileged it just clicks with how their minds work i mean that's what teenagers do we you know i i remember being a teenager and seeing the world really and you know my parents are the bad guys and these are the good guys and uh it clicks so well with kids that's what's really scary and i worry that once it's kind of baked in you bacon this radicalism into generation after generation we saw in 2020 a little spark can set off this massive social storm that you know you can imagine where those things go i mean what does our current out-of-control inflation look like it looks like paying 47 more fuel than you did a year ago it looks like paying 41 percent more for the same used vehicle if you buy it this year instead of last it looks like paying almost 10 percent more to feed your family it looks like every dollar in your savings is worth less than it was a year ago hedge against the u.s dollar by investing in something with real value gold and silver from birch gold precious metals have historically been a safe haven in times of inflation and birch gold is a leader in converting iras and 401ks

indigenous people's day like you know christopher columbus day nobody was a no harm no foul sort of holiday um you know we celebrated christopher columbus and the foul you know americas and all of this stuff and now you see something where they just go okay we're wiping this person because christopher columbus bad uh what are your thoughts on that yeah i i don't like that they use it as a replacement to an already established holiday so when they'd say what do you have wrong with indigenous people's day i'd say well why did you pick columbus day and and that's very intentional and i also think too that you know which indigenous people are you talking about when you look from a historical perspective first of all we don't historians will tell you that history begins with written records and we don't have a lot of written records so they try and bring in indigenous people's history which is really kind of cultural anthropology so that's kind of me nitpicking as a teacher but um there's just not a lot of substance it's kind of groupie again it's it's cultural marxism it's taking all these people that are different tribes and you know fought with each other historically had conflicts it's grouping them all together and it's pitting them against another group white colonists which were not a homogenous group either i mean you know any history teacher can tell you that yeah and i think what what frustrates me about it is again it's always good versus bad and there's no nuance assigned to it which is you know if you actually study history and its complexities you'll learn that obviously native americans had traditions of cannibalism i mean when you talk about the you know the mayans and um and they were horrible horrible traditions of using children sacrificing children eating children um and they found you know remains that showed that that they were cannibalizing even in colorado modern-day colorado and the new york times covered that extensively but not a lot of talk about that in the classroom and that's not to say that that means that we shouldn't have native americans but it's also really relevant to talk about the fact that the majority of them were wiped out by a plague by smallpox you know this wasn't intentional they make you think that they came in and they murdered and stabbed each and every one of them you know the europeans were carrying a virus and most people don't know that they really believe that they came in and they i think it was upwards to 90 percent yeah of native americans were wiped out by smallpox which was an unintentional pandemic that the europeans brought with them um and it it's i think children are missing out when they don't get to think about these ideas these complex ideas and are being told that the world is very simple and it's oppressor and the oppressed and like the oppressed is always a good guy um with no complexity and the oppressor is always a bad guy without absent any complexity or nuance yeah i i agree and and i think one of the reasons if you want to look at like why do teachers kind of promote this message i think because it positions themselves morally as kind of the good guys like we're taking the side of the oppressed we're the good guys and they like that power that comes with that that feeling of righteousness and for if your student you know having to understand the world in terms of good guys and bad guys like you get to pick a side yeah and as a teenager like well i'm going to be with the good guys and that's kind of funny you know a lot of times i'll have former students reach out to me as they get a little bit older and some of them that do start to shift conservatively like hey some of these good guys weren't so good and some of these bad guys weren't so bad and i'm like yeah exactly and then so that's your job as an educator is to ask those questions and prod them and get them thinking and help them see the world in a more nuanced way the

dishwasher with like a different color face on it or a oven with a different but they didn't all match up and then the refrigerator was stainless steel yeah so i was like i want them all be the same color and i want to be the color i picked not the one that the store picked out so i took off all the doors of of the refrigerator the oven microwave every appliance the dishwasher i took it all off it was all stainless steel and i had it painted the color i wanted to paint i put it back and it all matches now and people would say how are you going to paint stainless steel and i said i've seen a

the inside I'm actually crying because there has been a killer virtual reality headset created and by killer I mean not like colloquialism killer I mean like no it will kill you imagine a VR headset that will actually kill you so this is the article which appeared in the New York Post the first ever killer virtual reality headset is here Palmer lucky a leader in virtual reality and the founder of oculus better known now as a part of Facebook's meta created a VR headset that will actually kill the user if they die in the game vice's motherboard reported players put on a Neve gear virtual reality headset and open the new game which is called Sword Art Online which is based on the Japanese anime and novel of the same name the players must fight their way through a 100 Floor dungeon to escape a mad scientist's a virtual world the device is connected to three explosive charge modules above the screen that are aimed at the player's forehead should the player die in the game the microwave emitter would go off obliterating the human's head lucky who also founded anderol a weapons and defense contractor that has won large contracts with the government said the explosive charges on the headset are ones he usually uses in different projects although he did not specify which ones of course because those are going to be with the government quote what an appropriate game over screen is displayed the charges fire instantly destroying the brain of the user lucky wrote on his blog on Monday according to Lucky the device's Creator was able to hide from his employees regulators and contract manufacturing Partners I'm a pretty smart guy but I couldn't come up with any way to make anything like this work not without attaching the headset to gigantic pieces of equipment but you guys don't worry this article also says because the headset is not available to buy okay won't be worried that I guess if it's not available to buy I don't I don't know why but I'm still feeling pretty worried I don't know why this still feels very wrong and dystopian to me and I could just see kids and teenagers and mentally ill adults that are chasing a never-ending High wanting to engage in this I don't know why this feels like an episode of Black Mirror oh I know because it is there has been episodes of Black Mirror exploring virtual reality and people giving themselves that virtual reality and wanting to stay within a virtual reality forever so why not live and die within a virtual reality the mind of the individual that created This concerns me the idea that this individual also has government contracts concerns me that they won't specify why certain technologies that are used have already been used concerns me so no I'm not feeling like I should not worry at all I think that we need to keep an eye on the space I keep telling you guys the dangers of virtual reality as it returns to pornography now we're talking about a defense system for your head not a defense an offense system on your head which could actually kill you let's keep that conversation going um be very very concerned especially if you are a parent and that's why I never want my child to play video games because I can see the direction in which video games are headed all right guys that's it I'm going to continue reading some of your comments and I'm also going to answer your questions in the

obviously i think it's it's everyone's here at publication right now especially because the world is so dark and your headlines are just amazing so before we get into the story of the babylon b um let's just look at some let's review some of these headlines which are amazing uh fauci don's funny hat declares himself to be pope of science um prosecutor proves how deadly ar 15 is by accidentally shooting seven jurors that was so ridiculous when he did that i couldn't even believe it kamala harris is extremely likable and good at her job announces saki for no apparent reason whatsoever this is what these press conferences actually look like scholars now believe mary and joseph were denied room in the end due to being unpacked it's like yeah that's probably exactly what happened and this one's my favorite pelosi preemptively announces articles of impeachment against candace owens 100 [Applause] you got to give us the background story because babylon b blew up i mean it felt like it was overnight like it was a couple of headlines here and there and then it was just sort of overnight everywhere and the left was really mad about it so what is the story of the babylon bay i mean it's literally what you said it's an overnight sensation we bought a web domain for 50 bucks threw it up and started publishing articles and it was just instantly our full-time jobs basically who's we uh so adam ford is the founder of the babylon bee and he was doing this kind of a christian web comic for a while and so he had a little bit of a following on facebook and he announced i am creating the onion but for conservatives and christians and he launched it and it just kind of instantly became his full-time job i started writing for them just by emailing in headlines that weren't terrible i guess and so on day one i started i started writing for them and a couple years later i quit my my full-time job in the construction industry and started doing this full-time wow so you went from work that's pretty manly construction industry okay we weren't doing the building workers job yeah just yeah were you just doing what i was just doing a desk job okay you don't have to tell that part no that's why i always say construction industry but you had to call me out i'm so sorry i should i should have let that go kyle mann formerly of construction now of the babylon b we'll get back to

started in a garage right yeah yeah so uh adam ford is working out of michigan and he was just publishing stuff like in his basement type you know working out of his house and i was writing articles just in my garage and we we've been running like that for years the garage that's manly that's the well garage men love garages i'm trying to help you out here i know you're trying you're throwing me a bone but i don't have any tools in the garage just a computer oh gosh it doesn't work um so what's actually really great about the babylon b is that the left has taken this very seriously and you guys had a very public spat with snopes there at one point they were actually fact checking your satire and your jokes which is completely crazy can you tell us a little bit about that okay so yeah snopes has fact checked babylon b jokes since day one they've constantly been fact checking us um and the but the one that was the most absurd is we wrote an article saying that cnn purchased a giant washing machine to spin the news which he did not backjack that they fact checked it and it like if you google that article now the first result is not our article it's snope saying fact chick did cnn actually purchase a giant washing machine oh my gosh spin the news in and they do this long you know thousand word fact check we checked with cnn there's no record of any purchase of a washing machine like that it's it's wild and uh it actually makes the joke funnier to me when they have to pack check it because it is funnier yeah like they actually have to go in and make sure they don't have a washing machine right this is the investigative journalistic effort endeavors that are being taken at snopes yes yeah they they really hate you and and were you guys actually getting hit at one point with like fact checks on facebook how are you surviving the facebook fact-checking error well that was the world that was the wild thing about the cnn washing machine one because it wasn't just fact check facebook linked to that fact check and then dinged our page and tr and they they sent us an email saying that we were going to be demonetizing the platform um because we shared this article about seeing the giant cnn washing machine and they said you're sharing fake news so were you able to fight that behind the scenes or uh we kind of because we had a wide social media following on other platforms like twitter we were able to kind of make some noise about it and then eventually they reversed that but you know you think about smaller uh pages that don't have that kind of audience that can instantly respond to that kind of thing and and they don't have any kind of recourse for this kind of and it's it's not even a small page i mean i'm constantly the amount of money that i spend on lawyers getting them to look into these absurd fact checks they're not even fact checks anymore i mean they're pointedly sometimes when you click through to their articles they say this person never said that but we can deduce from this person's previous rhetoric that they must have meant this and i'm like this is not a fact check this is just blatant censorship and you're calling it a fact check and there's not much recourse facebook sort of just like puts them in between them as the middleman and they just kind of are trying to get to the step where they can get rid of your account we will get back to the show in a second but first let's talk about how you can protect your business from running a business hr issues can kill you bambi spelled b-a-m-b-e-e was created

go to bambi.com candace right now to schedule your free hr audit that's bambi.com candace we've had so many run-ins with these big tech organizations and it's all it's kind of this big cabal where they all reference each other so snopes fact checks us facebook then references that fact check and now on wikipedia it says some of their articles have been seen as fake news and then you look at like the new york times which called us a far-right disinformation site that's disguised as satire and then that gets referenced on our wikipedia page and then snopes references that so it's all kind of this big circle mafia goes around and around it's a mafia it is totally a mafia i mean i've been spending this episode talking about operation mockingbird and how they just all work together they're all being funded by the same people and they reinforce each other's lives but it is interesting though i think the babylon be being censored or being fact-checked because it kind of introduced us to this topic of humor in the in the era of the fact check where does humor get to fall and are we just going to get rid of humor altogether is comedy becoming a crime obviously we see what happened with dave chappelle kind of is where do you guys see it going yeah i mean it's really scary anytime your culture starts to crack down on humor you're not in a good place as a society and that's what it seems like to us is that because we're attacking the wrong targets they want to come after us i mean you look at how many satire pages how many uh tv shows late night comedy the the left controls and they're not concerned about any of that right snl can put up a skit it doesn't get fact checked right i mean they thought it was hilarious when everybody thought that sarah palin actually said that she could see russia from her house you know oh everybody got fooled by that and there wasn't all this concern about disinformation you know you didn't actually say that no she did not actually say that i was young i was young that was a saturday night live but yeah that was about where i got my i was on the left so i was about where i got my political information so you believe that until this moment yeah literally until this moment right now i'm sorry i'm sorry sarah yeah and it's it's really it's really concerning to us to see this place as a society where you can't make certain jokes right and if you are on the right if you're on the right or i mean even like dave chappelle's not on the right and he still tells one joke that kind of pokes back the other direction and all of a sudden he's like completely cancelled everybody comes after him well that's because the trans agenda thing i i've said this from the beginning that is actually the most vicious topic of all in all the leftist space of crazy you even touch the transgender of the transgender that's great by the way that was good sorry i'm gonna go ahead yeah exactly that is incorporated right here the transgender um and they go mad i mean look what's happening at jk rowling i mean she just basically said i'm different from a trans woman and they they are completely going after her posting where she lives um so that's one area where they go completely mad you just you just can't even go there whatsoever so dave chappelle was playing a very dangerous game with that yeah and they'll always come after us and say that we are punching down like we're attacking the wrong groups or targeting the wrong groups like we can only attack certain topics or or whatever but it really shows that they control the cultural power right and so for us to make fun of things like the transgender yeah great it's really punching up right like punching at the people that are controlling the cultural conversations right now thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new videos to watch listen

tremendous sadness almost you know like where do we go from here does it feel like we have our country there's so much division there's so much hate um there's so much bad rhetoric and it feels like the people that have the most power are trying to do the most damage and so i feel like maybe you should record a couple of tracks and make everybody feel a little bit better well i i agree with what you're saying i but i um my answer to all of the this uh this cloud that's over is this dark cloud is that god's in his seat and when i look at when i look at the bible let's say right and the stories in the bible i'd say that those who are in bad behavior are in trouble i'd say god will show his face and those who are blessed to see the truth like yourself uh will show us the way out and we'll be and and god will be exposing things as we go we will rise again this this country is a is god's country this there's a reason why we say in god we trust because we do and god has written in every part of our story so we're not going to disappear we're not going to to be destroyed like the many other countries that have been attacked by socialism communism marxism we're going to survive this and we're going and the truth will prevail so i'm very glad to be able to see that and i'm very glad to be looking at your faces out there to know that you know that truth and to see these wonderful

i have to ask this question um who is the most talented actor you have ever worked with and for funsies who's the worst actor uh well i i've been very fortunate to work with brilliant actors and whenever i've given a very strong performance it means that i've worked with other people who i'm playing off of because i i uh i'm a i'm a counter puncher when somebody comes and brings me energy i i get energy from that scene so i've had many many wonderful people again look at all the the pieces i've done and i say that one that one though but i have to say i started out with a a brilliant wonderful talent dustin hoffman and we had such a great time making midnight cowboy and and he is he's one of those geniuses and i'm a good pounce with al pacino we've never worked together on screen but he's another great one that i love and i but i love all these talented talented people i've worked i love talent when i see somebody with talent i it's exciting it excites me any chance you're going to tell me who the worst one was it could be just their antics on set if somebody storm into their trailer just go i'm not coming out until someone brings me a mint latte how did you know because i did it this morning no i i i really wouldn't ever say something like that but there are people that have there are people that when i've come when i've worked on something they'll wait until some until john gets to the set or other people they want to be the last ones to get to the set so annoying i mean it's completely nuts you know so and you can play with that a little bit because it's so funny yeah you know you can keep them in their trailer for a long time if you don't [Laughter] thanks for joining me on this episode of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube

can't you tell don't pay attention to this smile on my face on the inside I am hurting because so many celebrities are announcing that they are going to leave Twitter because they just can't bear Free Speech it's very upsetting to them that the government is no longer controlling what we are saying to one another via fact Checkers and censoring stories taking out the New York Post for sharing the truth about Hunter Biden they need that that's a better world for them they want a world that is not real but a world that is controlled and so many of them have lined up issued statements and said you can no longer hear my thoughts in 180 characters or less because I won't stand for this I won't stand for the First Amendment and the list of people reads sort of like a 1990s yearbook of people that you know you look in the yearbook in the 90s like oh I remember I remember that person ah he peaked in elementary school where he peaked in Middle School peach in high school that is what the list of people that are leaving reminds me of so I'm going to take you through that list first and foremost Whoopi Goldberg I will never hate on her she was so good in the Sister Act she definitely peaked in the Sister Act loved her you can no longer find her thoughts on Twitter Moby I didn't know who that was but then somebody reminded me that that was a a singer or a performer an artist of some description and he performed at Woodstock in 1999 so yeah he peaked in the 90s Toni Braxton definitely knew who she was played her music in my house in the 90s Nick Foley I didn't know who he was because I was not a big supporter of the WWF back when it was the WWF another person who peaked in the 90s Sara Bareilles I did know who Sarah Bareilles was she has a wonderful wonderful voice but I have to be completely honest I did not know that she was even on Twitter Twitter but now she's no longer on Twitter and so I'll never even be able to have the opportunity to follow follow her tweets then we have people that we do know that we very much do know and they are relevant today Gigi Hadid we all know the model Gigi Hadid I guess my question is do models speak we're models speaking was that a thing well if it was a thing it's a thing no longer because Gigi Hadid is not going to be speaking then of course this one really took me by surprise Amber Heard she's very relevant we just watched a trial in which we learned that she sometimes goes to the bathroom on her boyfriend's beds when she gets upset and I have to be honest I find it mildly inappropriate that she left Twitter especially because Elon Musk her ex-boyfriend took it over because Elon Musk don't forget he dated her right after she accused Johnny Depp of all these terrible things and not only did he date her he held her down he's issued a nice Tweet back when he didn't own Twitter about Amber Heard said she was lovely nothing bad happened between them he's one of the only people that did not throw her under the bus in the end and yet she has thrown him under the bus by announcing well not really announcing just deleting and wiping her Twitter feed the next one is confusing because it's funny Captain Sully yeah remember the whole movie Captain Sully the plane that went down and everybody got off safely thank goodness real story Captain's Holly the real Captain Sully is off of Twitter and I don't know why I find that to be funny because there's just a ton of inappropriate jokes that are actually funny because everybody survived but he's no longer going to be on Twitter if you didn't know that he was on Twitter like me you should now know that you can no longer follow him and um his thoughts because he just will not stand for this Twitter then it got really weird because objects started leaving Twitter objects not people but objects playbill who has no play Bill have you ever been to a Broadway play when they literally hand you a bill and it's called Play Bill and it goes over everybody that is going to be in the Broadway play and then has some advertisements and it will play bill has announced that that object is off of Twitter so that's sad now if if we are going to have I don't know how we could live in the twitterverse without objects but the first object to leave is playbill and you should know that it's gone and there's probably a further discussion that we should have because it's playbill today tomorrow it's pens and pencils and computers that just leave Twitter and it's going to be sad then there are some people who I put together a jury of daily wire peers we're just in a room just now nine people and I just kept going has anybody heard of this person and there were some people that told us had never heard of for example Liz Fair she's allegedly a musician of some description she never Peaks but she's off Twitter Alex Winter another person I have no idea who that is he or she never peaked off of Twitter David Simon won solitary hand went up and it was my executive producer she said David Simon created the wire and I was like ah everybody knows the wire but nobody really knows who created it so David what David Simon is off of Twitter in case you were concerned and then this poor person not a single hand went up in a jury of daily wire peers nine of us committed to the truth nobody knew who Ken Olin was but Ken Olin is so self-important that he announced that he is leaving Twitter so if you were interested in following somebody that you never knew existed I want you to know that you no longer have that opportunity to because he's gone now usually people put something virtuous and they write something I'm leaving because blah blah blah blah nobody cares but one person who I love very much and who did very much peak in the 90s with wonderful movies has left and he has included a video it was actually a viral Twitter post on Tuesday actor Jim Carrey announced to his 18 million followers that he's leaving Twitter but he also posted a video to go along with this announcement I'm going to read you his tweet it says I'm leaving Twitter but first here's a cartoon I made with my friend Jimmy Hayward it's based on my painting of a crazy Old Lighthouse Keeper standing naked in a storm summoning the angels and shining his lamp to guide us through a treacherous night I love you all so much and indeed this was a cartoon which he released and it it features a naked man so if you're listening to this podcast on your way to work all I can tell you is that this is a very bizarre naked man kind of fat looks like he's you know kind of guy six Budweisers every night with some hair on his chest and he's kind of leaning in the wind in front of a lighthouse and I guess uh that's supposed to make us feel chummy on the inside here is the video take a listen foreign here with your belt and the light is shining the lighthouse is shining the music's getting weird there are blue stripes Gaelic music [Music] Angels fill this place with light Angels guide them through the dead hold fast [Music] hear me wow that is it I don't know how you guys are feeling but I am feeling that it was the maniacal laugh in the end for me like that maniacal laugh I thought it was amazing and I'm sad that Jim Carrey is leaving and you know it's really on brand room to kind of just leave it with a crazy video because at the end of the day Jim Carrey's got a Jim Carrey and I think his actual character in real life is some semblance of all of the characters that he's played on the screen for us I think he's still the Ace Ventura the guy that got pooped out by a hippopotamus and Ace Ventura is who Jim Carrey actually is what a bizarre cartoon guys all of this to say it's a sad day mourn be sad all of these wonderful people that peach in the 90s are no longer with us on Twitter rest in peace peeps all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about the two married Good Morning America news anchors who had an affair and got caught I saw that so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "nHfUucovlyw": "i think honestly hell has frozen over first off two weeks ago on the show i laughed at a saturday night live clip which hasn't happened in ever and last week or over the weekend i saw trevor noah clip and i actually laughed out he actually did a very good impersonation of trump so let's watch that clip trevor noah funny one time ever here it is there is no denying that saudi arabia isn't playing ball with joe biden and you know what you can say what you want but this would have never happened to donald trump never no one was ever ignoring donald trump's calls yeah because if you ignored donald trump's calls you didn't know how he would respond maybe he'd send an angry tweet or maybe he just like banned your country from everything you don't know that's why i bet in these situations biden actually wishes that he could hire trump to step in as president wild card you know just keep everyone on their toes because if trump was calling you best believe the uae they'll be racing to pick up the phone oh mr trump mr trump we're here we're here hello too late ahmed you made me way two rings we're bombing the uae and the ufc just in case that's actually like i laughed out loud and the ufc just in case like and that really tells you where we're at now that you actually have them acknowledging that this would have never happened under trump and yes that part of trump's strategy is that they knew that he wasn't really playing any games and you weren't you just you couldn't play that typical political oh we're just gonna say something nice and keep things diplomatic because trump had the red button on his desk you know what i mean right and i and they are getting the red pills on their desk and popping them like tic tacs these days things are getting funny again isn't that great wow the man the covet mandates are over the anti-comedy mandates are over and now people can laugh again and just in time because we have the most clownish presidency in human history there's never been a time where we we need comedy more and even the hollywood celebrities are like wait a second even if i'm making 30 million dollars a year which is what trevor noah makes if seven percent to eight percent to ten percent of that is eroded through inflation that kind of sucks too right like it hurts everyone top bottom in between and so maybe they are getting red pill or black peeled in real time it's beautiful to see did you guys see that clip of uh donald trump talking to john daly on the phone in the clubhouse the country club john daly professional golfer donald trump calls him he's on speakerphone and donald trump says hey uh vladimir putin would have never done this if i were in office because i told him if you do anything we're bombing moscow he's like he maybe believed me like five ten percent but that's all you need and that's exactly that seems like the strategy that actually in hindsight worked pretty effectively right he was he was just taken more seriously upon the world stage and it is sad because he's also the thing about comedy is you're saying something that's fundamentally true they're just not picking up his calls right i can't even imagine the leader of the free world the united states of america you know glory to united states and they can't get someone on the phone i mean even over the weekend jen sackey you know first they said oh we're talking to venezuela about oil and then she said there's no conversations at this time which is basically her saying that venezuela is not picking up the phone call why would they they've been working with russia for years um and so this is sort of the dangerous foreign policy thing that we're going to get into in the next segment but the fact is is that what's going to end up happening is you can say all you want we're ignoring this person for ignoring this person we're sanctioning this person you're going to force allegiances amongst those people who go you know what we don't need the united states and that's the danger of a biden presidency yeah that's exactly right and also i love that trevor noah clip because can the reason it's fun all comedy is based in in reality the humor is based on reality i could totally see donald trump counting the rings you know counting the rings to pick up the phone and then like sliding into your dms back when you had 80 million twitter followers right oh could you imagine those i could totally see him counting down okay ring three you're done we're done we're bombing the uae and the ufc like data

situation that you couldn't actually ring racism out of this would be it right russians versus ukrainians i don't think there's a single black person that lives over there like there's definitely nothing about racism happening over here and yet somehow on the internet people were able to talk about how this actually was racism because it's always racism everything plus everything minus everything divided everything equals racism we all know that by now this woman on the internet says they can't even empathize with black or brown suffering if you're not white they think you deserved it you don't feel pain or you're better off being subjugated being like that is so weird so they're people are upset on the internet because attention is being given to ukraine um this is another person who says sorry y'all but this is hard solidarity to ukraine but trying to keep up with news analysis and balancing the anti-blackness is becoming impossible we are not accustomed to pain and violence we didn't get used to it it's not a reason to dismiss the value of our lives embarrassing embarrassing for the black race i have to say i know they don't speak for everybody but that is that is atrocious that people are literally bombs are falling on people and you see people scrambling and the government falling apart over there and literally a country is being invaded to a certain degree and they are worrying about black folks and these are the black people that live in america that live in such privilege have never probably picked up anything to work with in the field or do any of these things and they're complaining and perpetuation of complaining is what i see in and it's embarrassing that they would take this approach yeah i don't know what's shocking or at least shocking the fact that she has phd in her title like should we be shocked that a doctorate student would speak like this or should we be not shocked that not shocking and not shocking well i think here she's i'm sorry i'm probably misgendering someone at this point regardless of what i say but i think it's reasonable to question why so much attention is being paid to ukraine specifically you know there's a lot of i think factors that play whether that's governments or media who are specifically drawing our attention to this one conflict when we have no shortage of conflicts in this world but trying to say it's because of racism that we're focusing here i don't know how much history this person knows historically white supremacists have not been very you know in bed with the slavic people not fans of that and it's just it's a very superficial analysis and frankly this could only come from a person who is so obviously privileged that they make everything about themselves right and that's the thing is that that's what it is it's like can we take our foot off of the races and pedal for one second and the answer is no like people are just so accustomed to everything being about black issues and black race that the second they go oh look somebody else might actually be suffering a pressure that's not black they go whoa whoa whoa if this the only reason to be ignored is because like you know we're black and it's like guys have you been in america for the last two years did we not just burn forget america the entire world for george floyd did the whole world burn for george floyd is it not enough like what do you need to feel like you've got attention because i felt like you know six weeks of summer protest burning all across the globe for a criminal was like pretty much like you know you're pretty important you know like if you need a bigger birthday party than that like you know you're just never you're never going to be satisfied in life you know don't forget the golden caskets and all this other stuff that was that they buried this criminal in a golden casket you know what i mean he had three funerals three funerals he had more funerals than any black person that i can possibly think i don't know any black person history that's had three funerals i'm not even being funny like maybe no i don't i don't think of anybody but i can't think of anything that doesn't happen this is also uh today actually this morning i saw that one outlet i forget which one it is but i'm sure everyone else is going to be on board by the end of the day actually suggesting black history year um so obviously we just need to introduce and the thing is like okay if you want to talk about ethnic tensions in ukraine there's probably some of that between russian speakers ukrainian speakers and you know there are ethnic minorities there as well but to literally just see the world as black versus white i'm sorry but that is painting yourself so very clearly ignorant and you know obsessed with american politics and you can't always just replace that lens into like whatever situation you want right right absolutely and then like to give maybe just try to give this person a little bit of credit if it would have been a much more intellectual discussion if they wanted to point to what happened in somalia that nobody is talking about which is the fact that the biden administration has dropped bombs in somalia and for whatever reason the narrative is that when the united states drops bomb drops bombs we're always spreading democracy if anybody else drops bombs without the united states say so they're spreading terrorism and that's a very much larger discussion that we can have and it's not because these people are black and brown it's because this is how it's always been like the united states drops bombs it's like across the board we live in the west we had to do it it's amazing even weapon bombs freedom bombs exactly like they they don't bang the same apparently that's a freedom bomb we're dropping fyi giant crater in the middle of iraq it's a freedom bomb don't you worry about it and that's a that's a that's a discussion that's actually worth having right and i think but if you have a discussion then you work for the kremlin so we are not going to have that discussion today on the panel because i'm in trouble with the internet so i got to be leave that alone what does our current out of control inflation look like it looks like paying 47 percent more for fuel than you did a year ago it looks like paying 41 percent

involved in doxing if we did this on the internet we would be pulled down and our accounts would be banned but when the washington post does it it's totally fine so it's totally cool there was an account on twitter which i'm sure we all follow called libs of tick tock literally all this account does is it takes tick tock videos of liberals and it just places them on twitter and places them on instagram so you can actually see what they're saying to your children and all these looney tunes that we're talking about like all of these videos of them you know in purple makeup and men dressed up like pretty little princesses like four-year-olds which is extremely disturbing to see and it makes the argument much more real to parents that need to see these videos to understand what we're talking about these are not seen individuals that are targeting your children when you hear them speak you understand they're unstable that they're predatory um well the washington post decided to deal with this account by finding out who it was and doxing them putting out their personal information and we have uh taylor lorenz of the washington post we've got um just a few clips of her showing up at the person's family members doors harassing them and what's unique about taylor lorenz the reporter that was on this is that she once cried and talked about how and how scary it is to be a journalist in the world when people are coming after your personal information so taylor like take it away hypocrite and online online harassment is such a such a it's just a misnomer um i think it's a huge problem because um you know harassment is is a is it's a tool to silence people especially women and people of color people from marginalized um identities for speaking out and it there's a very intentional like goal behind it it's it's obviously it's death threats and all of that and rape threats on the daily and it's not just twitter it's like every single surface right like you know my cell phone number getting out there people calling people harassing my family members stalking me like all of that is incredibly terrifying and invasive um and it's bled out into the physical world too which is even more terrifying right but to me i think what what especially the media needs to understand about this in terms of protecting their own reporters is this is just a tool like harassment is a tool to kind of discredit and silence journalists you feel like any little piece of information that gets out on you will be used by the worst people on the internet to destroy your life and it's so isolating where's the tears well no tears not one tear and that's exactly of course what she went on to do trying to figure out who was running this libs of tit talk account basically threatening them with their faux deadlines like our story is going to mention your name you have five seconds to answer back um we're going to allow you to offer please if you'd like to offer a comment please let me know within the next hour you can give me a ring on if you if you prefer i mean this is how journalism is and this is just we've already written the article but now we're pretending that we're ethical in the background uh this is the state of journalism today look at the word that she uses in that email she says we are exposing the woman who runs live i think it's a woman the person who runs libs of tick tock we are exp it's not we're investigating a story it's not we're we are exposing we're we are going to open up two to violence potentially but certainly we are going to make vulnerable this private citizen who is just reposting videos that are already public after i cry my crocodile tears she actually didn't have any tears that's why she couldn't win the oscar for that only an emmy i think but what a performance as a working mother i take advantage of every opportunity to save time and money and if you're following me on instagram you know that i love to cook for my family and so thank goodness for good ranchers i love this brand i love the quality of their meat i love their delivery service not only do they help me save money but more importantly they help me save time their boxes are simple to order and they come straight to your door they make buying meat at the grocery store thing of the past especially because grocery store prices feel like they've absolutely doubled they have good ranches prices however stay low and affordable once you subscribe listen to this your price will never go up your best price is locked in for life so does it matter what the ablation is doing doesn't matter not to pay attention to any of that you are locked in they only source and sell 100 american meat from local farms and ranches their beef is prime and upper choice the two highest possible grades they have signature steak burgers and wagyu burgers that are packed full of flavor they're pre-trimmed and pre-marinated chicken breasts are absolutely delicious take it from me and it's so so so easy to prepare it becomes packaged just so easily they're better than organic meaning that they are completely antibiotic free so be sure to go to goodwrenchers.com candace to save on the quality that you've been looking for use my code canis and enjoy your box of 100 american meat and your 30 savings if you don't buy the meat in your house tell the person that does they have to check out good ranchers americanmeat delivered it is interesting this is in the last week there's been two of these types of stories from the washington post if you remember last week when elon musk is trying to buy twitter the washington post came out and said billionaires who are meddling in public forums should not be fun fact jeff bezos billionaire owns the washington post they said nothing about that so the two sides the the other side of the argument is never applicable to them it just never is yeah and it's it is so true that they've been creating these peer pressure campaigns i mean we even saw this um with the federal judge who removed the mass mandate they just started publicizing her face everywhere and here's how it works right so they see themselves as the this is this is the the criminals like you know the the criminality of that happens they're like i'm a journalist and i don't have to get my hands dirty so i'm gonna put out all the information that people like antifa need so they can find these people and they can harass them and they can get dirty and we're just gonna say oh we just ran a piece we had nothing to do with this and then these people show up to their doors start harassing their family members and things get violent and and the washington post is complicit in this this is how they run things and that's why i call them these are your typical run-of-the-mill brown shirts except they don't want to do the fighting right they look down their nose and they say all right antifa here it is send out the hounds now here's where this person lives and that's exactly what's going to happen this person it's been published now the article uh with her name and she's going to get harassed yeah and it's very interesting because she should be able to sue them she's not a public figure she's not a person that's out and open you cannot expose her information and make her susceptible to this but these individuals on the left are just shells of human beings i hate to say that i know some of them probably think certain ways about conservatives but these people do not have they didn't appear to have a soul how do you sit there and fake cry in front of the world and paint this picture of you being this virtuous person and you turn around and do the very same thing to a woman the same people that claim they care about black and brown bodies are creating situations to hurt the very people that they claim to support so every time i see one of these shell-like people it really makes me sick to my stomach you have to ask yourself one question what journalistic purpose was served by that hit piece if there were some question if this woman's identity were relevant to the political campaigns against transgender grooming again about the florida education bill if there were some relevance i could almost see an argument for doing investigative work but that's not what's going on here it's just to bully this person it's just to to silence this person and i i hope it doesn't work libs of tick talk is a pretty uh aggressive account but but the only between these two groups here the washington post and libs of tick tock one of them is a shameless hack propagandist for the ruling class the other is a journalist and i think we know which is which exactly and i don't know that they will be able to sue like i don't know if they can i mean they they haven't defamed turn anyway so i don't know how exactly like lipstick like i don't know what the legality is i mean i think doxing is a crime but i'm sure they were very careful not to talk to individuals even though they're giving just enough information to encourage other people to do it i hope there is some loophole in that maybe just for bullying and harassment and the person just not wanting to be a public figure because now this person is going to be a public figure and will not be able to just hide behind the moniker of libs of tick tock but that is what that's what the game is i mean these people don't want what they're doing to be exposed and the children has become the front line of this fight tick tock is where the youngest kids are i don't have a tick tock count but this is like this is the new social media frontier this is where they're being able to convince children that they can that they can pick their genders and it's why i always say to parents why on earth are you allowing your child to be on tick tock you know lives of tick tock is is it telling you why they should never be on that social media

smack is more masculine though a slap can lead to a duel you demand satisfaction and then you go out and shoot guns what was this was this a slap or a smack that will smith delivered whatever it was it was the smack slap heard around the world guys let's watch the clip jada i love you g.i jane 2 can't wait to see it all right [Applause] that was a nice one okay i'm out here oh richard oh wow wow i don't think it's great will smith just smack the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of me without your mouth wow dude yeah it was a g.i jane jones keep my white name now i'm going to okay okay yeah you can tell it's real wow i think even he thought it was the greatest night in the history of television okay yeah okay okay i would just first like to offer like just the decorum of chris rock in this i promise you i would be taken away in handcuffs i promise you if i was hosting a show and someone just kept smacking like how he kept this together and like just adjusted himself and kept going forward i mean that is peak class and professionalism and it should be honored um i do also want to say that a lot of people thought this clip was fake i think genuinely his reaction was so shocking that chris rock thought maybe he was joking with the smack and then when he got back and started screaming at him he was he realized this is real like he's actually reacting violently to a gi jane joke right and you're right because i watching it this way is not the way that you see it on any social media or any platforms you can't find that that makes you see how real it looks like it is but the joke i mean honestly these are the people that make fun of conservatives all day long say the most demeaning and horrible things about us and i understand she has alopecia and that's rough i know people with alopecia but the joke in hollywood terms it was like a one out of five did you know she had alopecia because i did not know she had alopecia no one knew it like unless you were in and watching her red table talk i guess if you're very into entertainment that might have been like a known fact but i had no idea because jada pinka has notoriously kept her hair low there's an irony too because there's a clip going around from the early 90s on the arsenio hall show will smith made a joke about a bald guy with alopecia oh yes yes and he had the same reaction that chris rocket he said it was just a joke come on it's not a big deal the the thing about this i feel bad for everyone involved other than jada smith because i don't think will smith was letting his anger out at chris rock i think the anger might come less from the mild joke that the comedian made about his actress wife at the oscars and more to do with the fact that this poor guy has been publicly cuckled and humiliated for two years by his wife and because that we're living in this liberal upside down world we're all supposed to pretend that's okay and if my wife sleeps around there is no big deal and that's totally fine and it's not the the old moral order reasserts itself in the end turns out guys don't like to be cuckleded and publicly humiliated and poor chris rock was on the receiving end of probably what what will smith was saving up for his wife's ex-boyfriend right no i mean you're absolutely right i look at him and i see a broken man i mean the most telling part to me is that he laughs first so he takes it totally as a joke and then he looks over and his wife looks like a villain from from like a superhero movie she looks terrifying you know and she's like this is not okay and then he immediately springs up and and does whatever he thinks that she that she wants him to be and and she has displayed over and over again throughout her red talk series that like she doesn't think he's adding up to the man that she wants to be it's why she has to go pursue these other relationships and he just takes it and and so you're so right to point out that this is really about a broken man i i feel sad for will smith because this is not who he is it's not who he wants to be and yet it's what he's going along with because because of what society tells him he's supposed to go along hollywood society not our society that's right today we can do practically anything from our phones buy cars order groceries and even deposit checks the scary part is that your phone carrier collects data on whatever it is that you're doing verizon has even admitted to doing this they say it so they can better understand your interest but really all they want is to sell your activity to advertisers which is why i use expressvpn expressvpn is an app that prevents your phone carrier from being able to see the sites that you visit and sell it off to third parties all it takes is one tap of a button and all of your network data gets encrypted and rerouted through expressvpn's secure servers for ultimate privacy expressvpn protects all of your network data so you can stay private even when using your favorite apps and expressvpn works on all devices the best part is one subscription can be used on up to five devices at the same time i have my whole family using expressvpn when your phone carrier tracks you that's a gross invasion of privacy you can either keep letting them cash in on you or visit expressvpn.com canis to get the same vpn that i use take back your online privacy today and use my link to get three extra months free that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com candace expressvpn.com candace by the way i like the idea if you're if you're at a restaurant or a bar and some guy insults your wife or your daughter or your mother i'm not exactly the demure free speech absolutist that says you should sit down and take it i like the idea that you go walk up and smack the guy in the face the founding fathers if you insulted their wife or their mother the founding fathers wouldn't have sat down and said well you know we have perfect freedom of speech they would have smacked him in the face and probably had a duel afterward so i'm fine with that the context here matters though the man is a comedian he's a jester his job is to tell jokes the wife is not exactly donna reed she's not sitting at home in her private life she's a very public figure overly public probably opens herself up to this and so in that context if you can't sit down and take a joke don't go to the oscars right and even if you think the joke is crass if you can't take down and say then take a joke i mean notoriously obviously dave chappelle made a joke and it actually wasn't funny you know he made a joke about me um and i didn't think it was funny my husband didn't think it was funny but the thing that i tweeted was that you know comedy is a protected space we understand this is what comedians do they push boundaries they say things and and sometimes it comes from a place of emotion what dave chappelle said about me was ten times worse than what he said about jada and i do i i question whether or not he even knew about her alopecia because as i said you know to people that really follow every second of entertainment they may have known that i had no idea she had alopecia she's always had short hair she's always looked like she could be going for the casting of gi jane so this would have gone over the head of tons of people and it's no justification and it was quite telling what when you learned because obviously obviously he then won the oscar um but you then learned that he didn't even apologize after until there was you know this media outrage and then he offered this apology on instagram which to me is kind of like you know it's it's a half-ass apology as my mother would say growing up violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive my behavior at last night's academy awards is unacceptable and inexcusable jokes at my expense are part of the job but a joke about jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and i reacted emotionally that's fundamentally not true because you laughed first right so this is sort of the apology of like oh man if i still want to get cast i need to offer this public apology i'm going to write it on instagram you know if he was actually sorry about the way he reacted that would have been a man-to-man apology face-to-face at the oscars after party as diddy had suggested was going to happen but he wasn't sorry no instead he was getting jiggy with it on the dance floor all night everyone saw it and what about venus and serena williams and their father this movie is you know was there to make them celebrate their life and their accomplishments instead of course an actress stealing a spotlight once again the other irony that not a lot of people are talking about here is that g.i jane is not exactly an insult because demi moore is extremely hot and was very hot in that room even then i don't think it's fighting words right right the joke isn't that i mean it's not me that's not saying

want to give us your story yeah so Texas recently passed some legislation Banning abortions past the detection of a heartbeat which is typically about six weeks now as you can imagine the feminist movement didn't take this so well now a huge actor by the name of Justin baldoni you may recognize him from the show Jane the Virgin came out with a video on Instagram explaining his take on being pro-choice so we'll show this video I just heard that the government can now decide what a woman can and can't do with her body but it's like not at all about women right it's not about women it's about life so does that mean that the government can now decide what us men can and can't do with our bodies it's not about women I have an idea what if every unmarried man had to get a mandatory reversible vasectomy I mean I got one so a lot easier than having my wife on birth control and I can tell you that it is 100 effective at preventing births and the best part is that I get to have all of the unprotected sex I want to have with my wife with her consent of course without any of the consequences you win fellas or is it your body your choice the stance on the vaccinations where they lose the because it's the same people that are saying my body my choice that refuse to stand up for people's right to choose not to have a vaccination I mean that is literally the dumbest argument that I've ever heard in my entire life like as if there's nothing that can happen before you get pregnant like there's there's nothing that a woman can do you know to stop themselves from getting pregnant I've never understood the arguments that they make exactly I I claim you're not really pro-choice you're a pro-abortion abortion because you have a choice you have the choice not to have Reckless sex and then get pregnant and that's everybody's that's every woman's Choice it's every man's choice so don't argue to me that it's about your body and your choice to do something it's not at all well as thankful as I am that he got a vasectomy um I I I I I do have to let him know unfortunately he is going to have to be banned from social media because he spread misinformation there vasectomies are not 100 effective vasectomy is actually uh go wrong on I think it's almost up to two percent of the time where everything in there reconnects and then babies happen Okay so medical misinformation being spread by him I will say this though I I directed his co-star Gina Rodriguez and let me tell you I think the IQ level on that set has to be one of the lowest in the business that's all I'm going to say yeah yeah and by the way I think what what he would be trying to say if he's trying to correlate a vasectomy as a choice that somebody can make then he could say yes a woman could choose to get a hysterectomy and it would have the same effect and women can choose if they want to to go get a hysterectomy if they'd like to um you know but this has nothing to do with what we're talking about when you're responsible for another human life and and I hate that we've gotten to a place in society where we cannot have an honest conversation about what abortion is what abortion isn't and it really starts with education and the education system unfortunately keeps pushing women to believe that it's not a child it's a clump of cells you can do whatever you want well I can tell you as somebody who just had a child you go into at 11 weeks pregnant and you it's not even just a heartbeat on the monitor that you see because they have a wonderful 4D sonograms now you can see the arms the legs and it's at that moment that you realize um that the left is lying the left is just simply lying uh you can see the baby dancing moving its arms and they've done this for a really long time and unfortunately I wish women just had more of an education and honest education about what it is that they're fighting to choose for when running a business HR issues can kill you

should be backing this pro-choice movement without any knowledge of what it actually means to have an abortion as a woman right exactly I love that you brought up ultrasounds because that was with our oldest child who's almost 13 that was the moment that I became entirely pro-life was her very first ultrasound and at the time back then it wasn't for you it was 3D but I remember seeing this like little movement on camera she made that seemed in so intentional and I started to cry I'm not a crying person and I was like this is everything that they've taught us about how this all works is a lie it wasn't even just the beauty of the moment it was it was coming to terms with the fact that every science teacher ever had lied to me yeah that was how I felt something else what are you talking about arms legs dancing like a little person I do fully support people who are like super pro-abortion like him getting vasectomies though I think that's probably good 100 yeah stand with him and you wanted to weigh this against by the way Amala what's going on in Afghanistan right so the feminist movement here in America has gone crazy after this abortion Bill and they're saying they're fighting for women and we're really fighting the oppressive patriarchy that is the American society meanwhile this is a video coming out of Afghanistan [Music] yeah so those women are fighting for the right to get educated fighting for the right to have jobs fighting for the right to leave their home without a chaperone a male chaperone fighting for the right to choose marriage meanwhile in America here are feminist protests [Music] gosh that is the most Grim looking cheerleading squad I want to kill my child yes yeah people trying to get them pregnant Robbie and I don't know um it's absolutely ridiculous but you're correct it just totally speaks to I mean just how pathetic the feminist movement I really do put that in quotations because there's nothing feminist about the feminist movement it's not feminine to argue and fight for a child to be ripped out of its mother's womb and torn literally live from limb this night is not feminist movement to say nothing about Afghanistan there's something feminine about that there's nothing feminine about this need to hate the patriarchy to hate men uh so this is to me this is the anti-feminist movement pretending to be something else and really they are destroying everything every value in society in my opinion uh that is being nod at there's a rabid feminist that looks like that at the Forefront of it right I will say this you know I think it's sort of interesting to finally find something that these feminists in America don't agree with the Taliban on because they are diametrically opposed on this issue but on other issues like forced face coverings no medical autonomy when it comes to vaccines um female genital mutilation via on children even they tend to agree actually on these issues so I'm glad we finally found something that they disagree on I think that that's a positive step I love that you always find something positive not to listen to that you're so optimistic he's so right it's amazing thanks for joining me on

also I'm going to uncover unpack a new tick tock Trend you know Tick Tock is where everybody goes with their various mental illnesses yeah well now there's somebody who's showing you how you can look like you're crying even if you're not crying because it's the cool Beauty Trend thing to do all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] foreign so I asked you whether or not you were participating in the trauma economy and if you're wondering what I am talking about it is abundant it is all around you as just one example I spoke to you a couple of weeks ago about that young woman in Walmart who whether on purpose or by accident cut off a man that was in line he told her that she couldn't cut and then she started shrieking shrieking at the top of her lungs and she said that it was just like her rape and that she was a rape victim and she just could not have the man speaking to her how dare man speak to her she's a woman this is just like rape except it's it's not just like rape you probably saw this same sort of trauma economy happen all across the globe when it came to Black lives matter suddenly every black person it felt like every black person was saying that every correspondence they had it was just like slavery you know the white surprise it's just like slavery when this happens except it's not just like slavery you see this sometimes that people are told that the way that they can legitimatize themselves in any conversation is just just to go very extreme right because as soon as you say something extreme like it's just like slavery or it's just like rape or it's just like the Holocaust it's really meant to sort of shut the conversation down don't look any further and people are doing more and more and more of this particularly on social media we've covered on the show over and over again the psychological phenomenon of having to be more and more extreme for likes right all of these pseudo disorders that are appearing people that are pretending to be trans pretending to have dinner dysphoria because it gives them a community it makes people feel bad for them perhaps and I need your support because this is just like that thing that it isn't actually like at all I was sort of thinking about this because I was having a conversation earlier I did a podcast with Winston Marshall and I'm going to give you a longer podcast with him as well he is a former band member of Mumford and Sons who stepped away because people pretended they were traumatized by him reading a book he had posted on his Twitter that he read a book that was written by Andy Noe regarding antifa and he said great book you're very brave and suddenly the left suffered a trauma suddenly they determined that I don't know this guy's a white supremacist and this is horrible and he's a racist he's none of those things you'll see that he's absolutely none of those things but they suffered at the hands of a tweet trauma economy on Twitter how dare you tweet that you read a book and let me try to explain to you why your Tweet was wrong and it was way deeper than you thought and it really is just like I don't know slavery or something it's ridiculous it needs to stop and the great irony which is what I was thinking about today is that we always use these extreme things as examples to justify our erotic Behavior our our erratic emotions because really what it is is we're unstable it's not a very stable thing to correlate everything to these events right it's just like World War II it's just it's exactly like slavery but the great irony is that we ignore things that actually do mimic those instances what I'm talking about is that I have very very much spoken out about how what we are all existing under is a modernized plantation and I'm not saying that in the it's just like slavery way but yeah there are things that are happening in our society that we should have a further conversation about right I'm talking about the growth of the state everywhere that it exists I tell people that we are inching closer and closer because of these Marxist ideologies very much to a slave-like economy and so I'm asking you to tether yourself to the reality of that statement because it is happening all around you and if you don't wake up to it you're not going to have the freedom to be able to change it and you think about slavery and the institution of it that existed in America you have to think about the components of slavery first and foremost it was so crucial upon plantations that the Masters had the right to sever families think about it they were selling people's family members in fact in Booker T Washington's Up From Slavery he talks about how he felt nothing when his sisters were sold right he because he was on the plantation he had a plantation life it meant nothing to him to see his family members go he'd meant nothing to him didn't feel anything when his mother died wow what power that gave the Masters right what power you don't even have a family this is your family this is where you work this is where you live and that's all that matters I talk about the breakdown of family that is happening all across our society covid pandemic let your family members die alone it's the right thing to do don't worry about anything else the state will keep you alive for another day that's really dark and that's really dystopian talk about the breakdown of family when we talk about the trans agenda we're talking about children that are mutilating their own organs of course of course they're not going to be able to grow up to have productive families and what is happening now as we covered a couple of days ago is this dawn of the idea that you don't even need a woman to have a baby actually we can create this fake uterus and eventually that will lead to us having to turn to the state to have children to even be able to have children that's a very scary concept but it's not just a breakdown of family that was necessary to maintain the institution of family no there were many other elements I think probably the most important elements was ensuring that slaves were ignorant they had to make sure slaves were stupid and they make sure slaves were stupid well they weren't allowed to read books going back to Winston Marshall of Mumford and Sons he was attacked he eventually stepped down from the band because he read a book a book that made him aware of how dangerous things were becoming in the states with antifa far left organization in a gang right leaving Winston Marshall aside in the United States we are facing a reading comprehension crisis that nobody's talking about everything is just like slavery except for the thing that actually is children are not learning how to read they are having entire systems like in Baltimore where they can't find a single child across five schools that's proficient in reading and writing you want to talk about something that's literally just like slavery slave codes prohibited slaves from being learned how to read why obviously because when a person is ignorant they are emotional and they are not rational they react to whatever it is that the Masters want them to react to they don't want the slaves reading reading picking up a newspaper and seeing that there's an Abolitionist Movement that started up in the north they want slaves to believe but this is all that there is right that everything that they fight for must be things that benefit the state the institution of slavery that is what is happening right now in our country that is what is happening when we become a society that hands out more degrees than we have ever handed out and yet we are producing students that have never been Dumber now I'm not saying that as an insult I'm saying that as a reality ACT scores are plummeting SAT scores are plummeting the kids are dumber than ever and yet they've never been more sure of themselves because look Mom I have a degree therefore I must know everything they do they know everything about sustaining the state which wants to enslave their minds there are empty vessels for which propaganda works the kids are up and they're fighting for things that will in turn grow the state's power will not grow their own power individually of course not no that's not how it ever works we don't talk about that enough but then you might say Candice oh that's a dramatic assessment because what about what the slaves went through that sort of torture doesn't happen I mean you'd be right if you were talking about whippings slaves were whipped they were whipped in front of one another to teach them a lesson if they ever got to thinking that freedom might exist if they simply escaped which many of them did but if they were caught yeah they had to suffer some tremendous consequences in case you think that we haven't modernized that and updated that then you have not been paying attention to the cost of speaking out to what they do to people in Hollywood like Winston Marshall when they simply read a book right they chase them out it is essentially watching a public lashing there is pressure put on companies to fire them to suspend them to get rid of them don't allow him to play his banjo and Mumford and Sons he read a book that we disagree with there is a corporate consequence for speaking out against the establishment and she typically they will smear you and they will liebel you how horrible living your entire life and never doing anything that's racist or white supremacist and then being accused of just that and having an army of people led to believe that you're horrible and a rotten person basically you are being told that you must choose between your livelihood stating your livelihood and committing to a lie or telling the truth that's a horrible horrible wedge to be between it's unacceptable but it's the price that many of us pay I paid every single day when I speak out on various issues and I don't take the mainstream perspective because what is the mainstream the mainstream is all about the growth of the state so I think in closing what I want to say and what I want to remind everybody is something that was told to me a couple of years ago which is that the one thing that connects every slave civilization that has ever existed throughout the entire world throughout any period is the fact that there were always more slaves than their War Masters want to think about that okay so despite Joe Biden's recent claims that our economy is strong as hell we all know that that could not be further from the truth which is why it's a good idea to protect your savings from big government and big Banks and you can do that by diversifying into gold with Birch gold investing in

during covid where the state actually owned your body remember that it was to get vaxed up or lose your job right I mean do you want livelihood you want to be able to sustain your family well you're a bad person and now you're going to be fired from work it took a tremendous amount of Courage for people to say no actually I'm not comfortable with getting this injection but I shouldn't be forced to choose between my job and what I'm comfortable with but some people said I'm gonna lose my job and it's taken time for truth and what is righteous to have any wins in regard to the covid pandemic the scam or the media propagandized every individual into believing they were going to die unless they gave more power to the state in the form of the trillions of dollars that disappeared to fight that pandemic well some good news today out of New York State Supreme Court essentially a judge came down and he came with a ruling that has reinstated all of the employees who were fired for not being vaccinated and he also get this he also ordered back pay for those employees saying that their rights had been completely violated the court found on Monday that being vaccinated does not prevent an individual from Contracting or transmitting covet 19. New York City just in case you didn't know this fired roughly 1400 employees for being unvaccinated earlier this year after the city adopted a vaccine mandate under former mayor disaster Bill de Blasio so 1400 people were fired for not being comfortable and the big lie was that get back to save lives right they can't explain to you how it's saving your life they could just trust them and then you started seeing people that were vaccinated coming out with kobit and saying oh it must be a fluke it's just a few people have breakthrough and then it was like okay no okay yeah I mean the vax isn't doing what we thought it was going to do but we're gonna fire you anyways because we're the state and you're a peasant and that's how it goes except this time this judge decided it's not how it actually goes I love this by the way so much because essentially what's happening is they held the line they did the right line they did the right thing and now they are being rewarded they're being awarded for having courage it's important to Have Courage where it matters and these people are being awarded in the form of they basically just got to go on vacation and now they're maybe gonna get forty thousand dollars or so in back pay uh for going on those Vacations so good for them great story speaking of vaccines and the shots that never end and I don't know why anybody's getting them President Biden who recently by the way told us that kovid was over then got kicked back into line and remembered that the politicians pockets are being lined with this this vaccine uh yes our job is to steal wealth from people and we do that by taking money from the government from your tax dollars and transferring it to emergencies so war in Ukraine war on covid never-ending Wars all the time and we just need to make you guys believe that it's totally fine that you're being robbed so he has come forward to say that he is getting his fifth vaccine shot now remember when that was a joke when we said you know first it's like it will won't stop it'll be effective and we were like then it became okay well what you need is the booster and then we said oh then there's going to be three and then there's going to be four yeah that joke turned out to be a reality and here is President Biden in his own words good afternoon I'm here today with uh my kova team as well as leaders from some of America's top pharmacies Walgreens CVS Rite Aids Albertsons and we're here with a simple message get vaccinated update your vaccine your coveted vaccine it's incredibly effective but the truth is not enough people are getting it we've got to change that so we can all have a safe and healthy holiday season that's why I'm getting my shot updated today we're especially fortunate here in the United States because my Administration made sure that we have the for the first country in the world to have vaccines that Target most common coveted strains for Americans over five years of age who are fully vaccinated our nation's Health experts recommend that they get the updated covert vaccine once a year in other words it's just like the flu shot and if you're fully vaccinated get one more covet shot once a year that's it all right so if you're already vaccinated the first time the second time the third time the fourth time all we're asking guys is that you get vaccinated the fifth time it's not a big deal okay look maybe actually just get vaccinated once a year what I mean what are we doing here it's not a big deal we're already almost there just get vaccinated once a year it's going to be now like the flu shot because it allows them to pay for it and to insist that there is some demand it lets them you know get past the free markets of course no one would keep getting this vaccine Common Sense would say I really don't trust if this is effective if I need to get five of them right and I'm still getting covered but you're not allowed to have common sense you're not allowed to believe in the free market so the state will just keep buying stuff and taking money from you and it's great that he's got all those Executives behind him that are making money off of this it's great that he's got Dr fauci behind him who's making money off of this it's really good to see the people that are colluding to steal money from us all taking a stand and doing it together right it's just absolutely wonderful to have the entire team of villains there so you heard me go get your fifth shot never mind get a shot once a year never mind if you really care get a shot once a month never mind if you really really really care you need to make sure that you get a shot once a week and maybe once a day that is clearly where we are going with this absolute disaster speaking of covet shots and I'm not here to imply by the way how this happened or why this happened but we have all been recognizing that there have been a lot of sudden deaths that exact language that we weren't saying before kobit and now we're saying all the time to describe people are they're just dying suddenly and we're being told that it could be from pandemic stress or various other things and a lot of times we're not even being giving an explanation for why so many for just one as just one example healthy athletes are dropping dead right and they just oh he just had a heart attack at 30. this is totally normal except then when you look at the data it's not normal we are having high incidences of people that are suddenly dying unexpectedly and the media is virtually ignoring it well as I said I cannot say that this death had anything to do with anything other than what Megyn Kelly actually says but she did announce the sudden death of her sister Suzanne Crossley during her podcast on Monday and I will allow you to hear Megan Kelly in her own words describing this tragedy something really sad happened in my family over the weekend um my sister died she was 58. her name was Suzanne Crosley and she died suddenly on Friday of a heart attack she hasn't been in very good health over the past couple of years just like sort of one problem after another so it was sudden and it was it was unexpected um and I went up got news of it after the show and went right up and was there with my mom and my brother Paul and my my nephew Brian one of her three kids when she passed so it was really hard it was extremely emotional my poor mom as you all as all moms and dads out there know this is not the order in which this is supposed to happen um so in any event we were all together over the weekend I'm going back up there after the show today and she will have her funeral tomorrow I know Megan Kelly she is a wonderful person honestly I've been on her show before I've worked with her I feel so sad that she's going through this and I just want to express my deepest condolences to her I publicly stated something on Twitter but I also want to State it here and to extend those condolences to every single person who is having a circumstance where they're losing somebody suddenly and unexpectedly two heart attacks obviously her sister was very young and you can see how affected and impacted she is by this and it's something that I just wouldn't wish upon my worst anime so Megan Kelly we are all praying for you I mean that sincerely not as just something to say our team is praying for you and hoping that your family finds closure and strength during this horrible time alright guys I want to jump in to this next story which is it's funny it is very funny when we talk about a trauma economy everyone's just looking for something to be sad about and they're looking for racism everywhere so a lot of times we just jump on boards and say that things are I don't know literally horrific and racist and backwards and they can't believe that we're seeing the state of politics today well that is exactly what Pete Dominic did in case you're wondering who Pete Dominic is he is a comedian allegedly except he wasn't being funny in this scenario and he's on the Last Week Tonight Show he was convinced that Ron DeSantis supporters were shouting refried beings at Democratic lieutenant governor of Florida nominee Carla Hernandez obviously Carla Hernandez is Hispanic and he saw a video of people shouting towards her and he was convinced they were saying refried beans because everybody knows that if you don't like Spanish people what you should do is find them and say refried beans refried beans refried beans so he tweeted this with a video this was his tweet he says in case you hadn't seen this Santa's supporters shouting refried beans at Carla as she was walking into the theater for the debate sad state of politics to say the least that is sad that's ridiculous I can't believe we're just like yelling Spanish meals now at people we are we this is a racist backwards country I one time I've got to be honest I saw a Hispanic person I just said quesadillas tacos Tapas refried beans steep down it's what everybody does we're angry and racist except we don't because that's ridiculous it's really really stupid and he tweeted this out and of course it never happened and it turns out that what they were actually shouting these grown adult people was keep Florida free so I'm very sorry that this did not check out and that people are not crazy enough to shout menu items uh but it was a good narrative while it lasted moving on you guys we talk about Tick Tock option on this show I do not have a tick tock account I refuse to have a tick tock account I will never have a tick tock account because it's burning brain cells I'm telling you guys it is burning brain cells get your children off Tick Tock I say it often and I will keep saying it well there is a makeup trend on Tick Tock makeup artist who started this her name is Zoe Kim Connelly not saying she's not talented as a makeup artist she might be all of those things but she is now directing her content toward unstable girlies where my unstable girlies at yeah she wants to show you how you can do your makeup to look like you're crying wear my unstable girlies at here she is on Tick Tock in this now viral clip take a listen so this one is for the unstable girlies you know how we look good when we cry it just comes with the territory um but anyway if you're not on the mood to cry here's how to get the liquid makeup okay so we want that puffy soft lip right we're going in with a soft spoken lip by m Cosmetics blurring the edges with a brush and then going back in with a neutral liner next it's really a monochromatic moment I'm going in with a double cheeked up palette by Fenty Beauty over my eyes under my eyes on my cheeks and of course my nose next we're recreating that glisten in our eyes with some liquid glitter on the bottom lash line and my favorite vinyl effect by about face put it where you want Shine the Cupid's bow is a gray area the lashes got to be curled okay it just completes the look but most of all the gloss you know I think what I like about this video is the comments beneath it in the comments beneath it girl writes no really I feel so pretty after sobbing and coughing my lungs out that's not a joke she says never tongue in her cheek there she's being serious she feels pretty and then another comment says my signature makeup since 2012. I want to look like I'm pretty crying all the time as opposed to the miserable crying that I usually do LOL LOL LMAO Tick Tock so that's the thing guys if you want to have that nice just cried my tears out glisten all you have to do is log on to tick tock and follow Zoe Kim Canali and she will show you how to do that I don't want you to think at the same time that we're all crazy and society's going down the drain that's not that that's not that we just want to look good and we always look good after we're set there we go guys all right I have to cover this unfortunately actually not unfortunately fortunately I love covering Madonna I don't know there's just something about her I just I just am now enjoying her I harm Meghan Markle are firmly in the same camp I used to not like them but now I'm enjoying the crazy a little bit I'm on the journey with them and Madonna has posed a very thought-provoking question to her fans on Instagram she's asking this if you aren't someone the church would have killed 400 years ago are you even living and then she of course because she needs something to put with the caption shared some provocative photos of herself because hey the church would have killed me look at me in my undies look at me with my boobs out the church would have killed me I mean are you even living if a church wouldn't have killed you 400 years ago and I really do think that I don't more Madonna kind of what she should be asking herself whether is whether or not we should have as a society moved away from having insane asylums she's just getting up there and getting crazier and I do believe that she is a victim of her own Fame and her own wealth I think Madonna has never been told no or it was a very long time ago when people around her told her no or that she shouldn't do things and she thinks that everything she does shows how free she is you know I can I'm free to be a pervert you know Matt Walsh my colleague says this all the time and he's so correct just because you can do something doesn't mean you should and for whatever reason people don't understand stand that and they think that everything that they can do they should do right I have the freedom to do this so I should do it and that isn't so it's not it's that's not fighting for Freedom at all and to be honest let me just say this in conclusion when it comes to girls getting naked on the internet if you really really really want to shock me keep your clothes on because it's just you know we've got boobs and breasts everywhere it's so abundant it's just it's the most natural thing in the world almost to see on Instagram at this point if you really want me to go oh I can't believe she did that just wear a shirt all right guys we are now going to jump into the comment Roundup you know I like to read your comments and your thoughts I hope you guys are nice today you a few of you were commenting on my monologue regarding forgiveness where I spoke about yesterday how I had a cousin who I was really close with and now we aren't close at all because he kind of suffered through a little bit of trump derangement syndrome but he did apologize for it and I do legitimately forgive him I just don't really know where to go to for there many of you commented and said that you had similar experiences this comment is from art vandelay he says Candace it is lazy to sever relationships it is an indication of poor character to several relationships when you are suffering relationships with family members and close friends over some way that they've hurt you it should be an extreme and last ditch measure to protect yourself the whole idea of sovereign relationships is predicated upon the fact that people don't realize that they have just as many false if not not more than those they feel have hurt them it is a clear indicator that you do that you do not have an awareness of your own shortcomings when you have a knee-jerk response of cutting people off who you feel have hurt you I like that comment disagree with some elements I think that you have to sever when a person is being toxic in your life but I think something that's compelling about your argument here is that it's a bit lazy not to work towards trying to fix that relationship and it is a good thing to keep in the back of your mind that you're not perfect and you're right I am not perfect I have most definitely done things to hurt people throughout my life I'm in a different place today and I like to think that I'm a very well-rounded person that treats people very well let's not say that I've always been this person and it does require work on on both parts and but I just want to say I'm not lazy all right I gotta show a podcast five days a week I will not accept that I'm a lazy individual moving on to the next question Clarice says I think being able to move forward with someone who hurts you stems from an understanding that you have the same potential for evil that they have it is by the grace of God that you haven't hurt them the way that they hurt you of course moving forward after being hurt you need to consider boundaries that you're comfortable with and take it from there but in reality we're all capable of hurting each other deeply that's a very similar perspective and I love that you're absolutely right we do all have a tremendous potential for evil and I would like to think that I wouldn't hurt somebody in that way and maybe that comes from obviously being myself and saying I just can't hurt someone in that regard but you're right if principally we all have potential for evil and it's a good perspective to have I think you guys are teaching me how to be a better person every day this comment is from parentina my ex-best friend threw away our 30-year friendship because I got red pilled about abortion and became vehemently pro-life and conservative he was so angry about me not supporting killing babies that we didn't speak for six months then one day he showed up at my door and threw my extra set of keys at me and told me to f off and called me every liberal insult you can imagine the ists and the phobes all the hits that was seven months ago and as far as I'm concerned the Friendship is dead in the water but my former friend has no other close friends and one day if a tragedy strikes him and he contacts me begging for my forgiveness the answer will be no I won't be there for him he showed me that his friendship is conditional it requires me to walk on eggshells I'm sorry I'm not doing it Democrats have no loyalty so they should get what they give no forgiveness from me well parent Cena just to give you a little bit of feedback in there you started with saying that you one day you were red pilled well just because you woke up and were red pilled one day doesn't mean that you should expect everybody to be readable on the same day that you're red pilled maybe he just wasn't there there yet right and we are talking about how we have this conditioning and this whole trauma economy and he wasn't above believing what you once believed so to him you might feel like you were the one that betrayed your friendship because you were the one that changed in the beginning so I think maybe granting the fact that someone needs the similar amount of Grace I'm sure when you got red pilled it transformed your perspectives of people that you maybe didn't like and so I I think no matter what if tragedy strikes being there for someone if they're alone is probably the right thing to do and I but I do not fault you for not wanting to have a relationship where you have to walk around in eggshells because it's not a real relationship it's I always say that if you want me to be friends with someone then I can't say what I think or what I believe you're acting asking me to be an actress and I don't think that that's really fair okay we got some comments regarding anti-semitism if this person says Hannah as a Jewish person myself I agree with Candace silence does not equal violence stop forcing people to make statements Hannah thank you I appreciate that so much I appreciate that because I've just been saying to people over and over again I am friends with yay I'm asking you to accept that I'm friends with him and to give me the grace of having a real relationship with someone that takes place offline and to not you know get some sadistic satisfaction with me joining the chorus of people to publicly condemn him and it's wrong to condemn me for the actions of somebody else or the words of somebody else and yeah thank you I appreciate that next comments Candace sadly I was one of those people that believed what the media said about you before I even heard you what changed is when I caught a snippet of a video months ago of you outside patrice's home politely asking questions and how she totally turned that around and claimed that she was in fear for her life that was my aha moment I've been with you ever since you have opened my eyes it enrages me me all the lives the media says about you keep proving them wrong thank you and that goes back to the earlier comment where people have their aha moment at different times and you can't expect us all to be read pulled at the exact same moment and that was a great video it really does show how far but we'll go to victimize themselves uh hinting back against that trauma economy I was eight months pregnant I mean there was no one that I was going to harm uh I mean I was pretty hungry if I was hungry I probably would have harmed someone for a sandwich but you know I get pretty younger I'm pregnant but that's about it next comment is regarding Harvey Weinstein and my take that his defense put up a good defense that's all I'm saying I do think that he is a total jerk and not a good person and a sleazeball but the defense was strong Sadia says the Weinstein case really got me to lose friends as I said I don't get why someone would go to a hotel room for an audition and even if they go and the guy is acting weird why not leave anyways I was told I'm victim blaming I was in university at the time she would only imagine how much seclusion my opinion caused me but I'm glad to hear this and I know that I'm saying oh my gosh Cydia let me say this I feel the exact same way especially when it came to Louis CK it was such a such a bizarre cancellation you're going to his hotel room at 3am and then you're like he was in a robe what what else was he supposed to be at 3am and what I actually think is that there is something that is implicitly misogynist in the expectation that women are so dumb that they don't we just don't even know what a man could possibly want or what he could possibly be thinking when he invites me to his hotel room at 3am and I say yes or you know I think in a Louis CK case they said that they were the aggressors they wanted to go with him after a show we we know that men are interested at the very least in having sex with women what are the signs that we could possibly be signaling to them that we want to have sex with them now if you said that you know you just were at with him at work and he came over in a robe and was like hey what's up baby I'd be like okay that's harassment if you're telling me that you made the effort to go into his personal Hotel space at three o'clock in the morning and you're surprised that he thought there may have been a little sexual innuendo there I would say that you are bsing a little bit a lot a bit next comment was regarding the artificial womb that we talked about a woman says I'm grateful to you for bringing up the subject of fertility it's something that I have noticed among a lot of women my age and I struggle with it too something isn't right no reason why young healthy women should have so many issues trying to have children it's pretty terrifying and extremely heartbreaking best wishes to all the women and their spouses that are out there trying to grow their families best wishes to use Shona it will happen pray on it I feel that you will have children and I'm just gonna say that I say that to every woman and I think that you know stress doesn't help so that's why it's like if you're trying just keep trying and know that what's meant to be will happen but yeah it's why I am against people taking birth control pills I did not take birth control pills every day something to me about putting hormones in your body every day I don't need an expert or a doctor without you to explain to me why that can't be good long term uh doing any pills long term we know we have increased our dependency on big Pharma for everything there are women that you know can't even get through menstruation without having to you know give themselves tons of pills and I'm kind of a person that is very crunchy when it comes to that stuff I will use vitamins for everything I really really really neglect using pills unless there is an emergency situation it wasn't the way when I was growing up I think a lot of my illnesses are because you know also the vaccinations the explosion of vaccinations I'm almost certain that the allergies that I have are due to my parents getting me vaccinated again this is my personal opinion and I do not tell people how to run their households but I am very wary when it comes to Big Pharma all right guys that's all I have to say about all of that's you know the next portion of show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you are not yet a member click the

rare that somebody breaks through all of the noise and has the courage to say the things that need to be said which is why i'm honored to welcome my next guest he is a professional basketball player for orlando magic and the author of the national bestseller why i stand if you don't know jonathan isaac for his work on the court then you definitely know him because you've seen these viral videos of him surviving what i believe just to be peer pressure campaigns that arise in our society most notably let's take a listen to this clip of him at a press conference during the black lives matter demands and riots during the summer of 2020 take a listen guys a lot went into my decision and part of it is first off um is my thought that you know kneeling or wearing a black lives matter t-shirt um don't go hand in hand with supporting black lives and so um i felt like just me personally what it is that i believe and standing on the stands that [Music] i do believe that black lives matter but i i just felt like it was a decision that i had to make and i didn't um i don't feel like putting putting that shirt on and kneeling one hand in hand with supporting black blouse or that it made me support black lives or not i believe that for myself my life has been supported through the gospel the clip that we just watched was him enduring a bunch of questions because he refused to wear the phrase black lives matter you remember the whole nba sensation it was like every player just had to get in line with the black lives matter narrative you wear the t-shirt you were supposed to kneel he didn't do any of that he was the only one standing and he was wearing white jonathan it really is an honor for me to have you on the show um i think you are just as i said to the audience tremendously courageous and i want to start with just that what made you decide to stand you know you talk about this in your book but talk about it to a larger audience in case they haven't read the book yeah candice uh first off thank you so much for having me um i would say what led me to stand there's a lot of backstory on a lot of details so you got to get the book why i stand to get all of that but for me i didn't see the black lives matter movement or organization as the answer to actually being able to hear what was going on and so when i looked at my life i said you know what my life has been supported by christ the gospel and the love of jesus christ is what has changed my life and i know that to be the answer for the world because racism and all the other things we deal with as a society as humans are heart issues and so i couldn't think of a better antidote or message for the times to heal the hearts of men other than the gospel and so that's what i decided to stand up and say i didn't want to go along with a narrative or you know anything divisive i didn't even want to make it about me just to stand up and say you know what i believe the answer to be jesus and and leave it at that but you make it sound so easy right i remember these campaigns that were going on and if you were an athlete or a public figure i mean i would just imagine if i'm playing basketball and uc and they have you know other basketball players that are going out saying this is what must happen it can't have been that easy to make the decision to say you know what i am willing to be alone in this and to say you know what i i believe in christ i believe in the lord as a solution i don't believe in really what was a trend at the time so how where did you draw that strength from what was your decision-making process yeah so to say that it definitely wasn't easy and so just answering that question of why i did it that was why but then getting into how it came to be was it was tough you know i i didn't sleep the night before if i didn't have the people that i have in my life like you know in the book i'm on the phone with my pastor the night before saying you don't understand how big this is going to be i haven't signed my contract yet um you know there's a lot of things that are writing on this and i know i'm going to get backlash i know i'm going to be a  i know i'm going to be an uncle tom and uh we we landed on him saying look you cannot stand for god and god not stand for you and so in the moment it was it was tough it was hectic i knew what was going on i knew how big it was going to be but for me it's like i i knew i knew what what what's my truth in terms of what i've experienced in my life and i knew that you know uh you know the black people you know can be supported by something other than you know what was being pushed and so looking at my life and not just black people but all the people have been supported by the gospel it's like man that can be the answer that can heal and mend the world and so that's what i decided to stand up and share did you know that every time you connect to an unencrypted network in cafes hotels airports etc your online

candace that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com candace expressvpn.com candice what was the backlash how did your teammates react i guess first and foremost you know because that's you're seeing everybody's doing the same thing you're in lockstep you're exposed you're expected to be a team what was their reaction like well it wasn't an easy situation you know during that time it was a very emotional time um you know there were several guys that were really invested and tied to black lives mattering and again not saying that black lives don't matter it was just that for me i don't believe that black lives matter more to anyone than they do to god and so it was like yo like i hear what you're saying but you know you know guys were you know some guys were upset about it some guys didn't you know really like it and we had a conversation a heated conversation that's detailed in the book um but we were able to leave that look you guys believed in what you were kneeling for and i believe in what i'm standing for i wasn't protesting you know you guys as protests it's just it's just what i believe in and so i respected you guys in your decision to kneel and i just asked for that same respect in return the key word that you just said um is emotional it was a very emotional time and i find that when people are emotional they suspend rational thinking um and then it just piles on when you're in a group of people that are also emotional and people are just not thinking and um as you may or may not know i've been working on this documentary because i want to just know where 90 million plus dollars for an organization that we were told was supposed to be the solution right that was supposed to help black america where it went and the stuff that we have uncovered is amazing um i'm very even though i don't want to spill anything too early because it's coming out in a couple of weeks i would say almost none of the money went to actually furthering and helping black lives and i think people are starting to see that and ask questions now in the media have any of your teammates the people that were around you change their minds at all like had they kind of realized that hey maybe we got on board with something a little too quickly or is it kind of like silence kind of got a little crazy but i'm not going to say anything more about that well i've i've had a few conversations um you know not even necessarily teammates but just guys around i think people have definitely taken a step back and kind of calmed down a bit and when that emotion is gone like you were saying you're able to kind of think rationally and clearly and you know a lot of people are seeing a lot of the things that's coming out you know with the black lives matter organization about the way that they handle their phones and all that stuff but it really is just tragic it's it's it's sad it sucks because there were so many people who were so invested in that moment of you know black lives mattering and hoping that this thing can be the salvation of the black community and everything like that and so for me it just reiterates um that you know salvation is not going to come through an organization it's not going to come through a movement it's not going to come to a party it's ultimately going to come through the hearts of men being changed and that's where the gospel comes into play thanks for

what are your guesses what do you guys think I'm doing I'm not going to tell you until tomorrow today the question of the day is this ready if Adolf Hitler said in the speech two plus two equals four would he have been correct I want you to think about that plus later on we're going to talk about Kamala Harris who caused a ton of panic and outrage when she said to the survivors of hurricane Ian that the Biden Administration was going to focus on giving resources based on equity yeah that's where we're at in America all that and more today I'm Candace Owens [Music] all right guys before we

question of the day I do want to follow up from last week's episode on Friday we covered the topic of homosexuality I was a little nervous that I was going to get dragged on the internet I know a lot of people that listen to this podcast and are fans of mine are lesbian and are gay and so I was interested in seeing your feedback on that most important discussion that we had really trying to get to the bottom of whether or not we were artificially creating lesbian and gay people in this Society in the same way that we are seeing these instances of pseudo-transgenderism that is really inspired by pop culture it's now popular and cultural and relevant for a child to say that they're confused about their identity we talked about Ellen DeGeneres we talked about about people that survived sexual assault who sometimes turn to lesbian or gay relationships as a way to protect themselves feedback was overwhelming I read your comments of some of you who said yes Candace actually I suffered a childhood trauma and today I'm a gay man or I'm a lesbian woman so I was super inspired that we are able to continually have these sorts of deep discussions that many people are not willing to have so thank you guys for that I'm always reading the comments whether it's on social media or if you're emailing the show but today I asked you the question if Adolf Hitler in a speech said two plus two equals four would he have been correct ladies and gentlemen the answer of course is no he would have been wrong because he's Hitler what's wrong with you how dare you say that anything he said could have possibly been right what are you anti-semitic do you want Jewish people to die that kind of sort of embodies the sorts of discussions we have today where there's absolutely no Nuance once we decide that an individual is a bad person then everything that they've ever said or that they will say is shouldn't even be examined it's of course wrong it's of course backwards this person is bad or good this person is an evil person or a loving person everything in our society is black and white in fact I call this almost BLM syndrome it sort of reminds me of when black lives matter exploded onto the scene or even the 2020 protests of George Floyd God forbid any individual leaned in and said hey but wait a minute I don't know about this organization black lives matter if you said that at the time which of course as you guys know I did suddenly you would become Public Enemy Number One because how dare you exercise any Nuance of course black lives matter is good and if you disagree with black lives mattering then it's because you're a racist right you're just a bad person how dare you even ask a question so what we don't know where all the money is going and it appears to be into a black hole so I was thinking about that because I am so routinely frustrated by our inability to have any Nuance I'm so frustrated that every time I try to explore a comment or an organization when it's trending and it's trendy to love that organization or to love that individual I am always hitting the media right for example when this the out at the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine I said what was totally fine to say a couple years ago zielinski is a bad faith actor if you were reading the New York Times or the Washington Post a couple of years ago they were honest about his bizarre ties to billionaires and some shady dealings in the region obviously people would say that Ukraine was a laundromat and people in the west would go there to clean their money that was all fine years ago but now all of a sudden he's been promoted to to I don't know the cover of Vogue cover of Vanity Fair Forbes is doing a piece on him he's dressed well he's got a stylist and now we're only supposed to say good things about President zielinski and we're only supposed to say bad things about Vladimir Putin that's just where we are today and I had gotten hit by the media because I had the audacity not even believe what I did it's really bad I had the audacity to read one of Putin's speeches in its entirety and to comment on it I know it's crazy why on Earth would we do that we have the media who are supposed to read the speeches for us interpret it for us and tell us what to think we're not supposed to think for ourselves or to think critically or to think with a little bit of nuance you're not going to believe this though guys it's it's Monday and I'm fired up and I'm gonna do it again I did it again I read one of his speeches in its entirety Vladimir Putin's and he said something over the last couple of days um he actually said several things that I wanted to bring to your attention now again because I have to say it's obviously I am not supporting Vladimir Putin in the same way that I am not supporting president zielinski I think there was a lot going on in that region that few of us will even understand and it is important that we talk about it because it may impact in fact it is it is impacting us now right there now if you're following uh what's going on you have Putin who is outright accusing America of attacking the pipeline of attacking Nordstrom of basically trying to inspire an energy crisis throughout Europe because it would benefit us now I can't say whether that's true or false obviously I wouldn't possibly know that but what I can say is that some other notes that he hit in his speech are interesting and I want to see what you think about it so essentially the speech that he gave is him saying um and I'm summarizing here that uh the American way the Western Way has always been one of plundering of inspiring Wars because we were facing an economic crisis or an energy crisis and he's accusing us of doing the same here he starts talking about this inflated capitalization of America basically saying that we don't have any true wealth really we inflate the cost of social media companies but that's not actually true wealth because it doesn't help us feed our families so I'm going to directly quote him you can't feed them with those pieces of paper and the virtual inflated capitalization of Western social media companies can't Heat their homes everything I'm saying is important and what I just said is no less so you can't feed anyone with paper you need food and you can't heat anyone's home with these inflated capitalizations you need energy that is why politicians in Europe have to convince their fellow citizens to eat less take a shower less often and dress warmer at home and those who start asking fair questions like why is that in fact are immediately declared enemies extremists and radicals they point back at Russia and say that is the source of all of your troubles now the reason why I found I'm going to stop right there the reason why I found that part to be interesting is because we saw that in real time in America so it doesn't really matter what you think about Ukraine or Russia or Vladimir Putin or zielinsky but we watched in real time how before there was ever any conflict in that region before anybody had declared war in that region our gas prices were going up we saw this it was happening and we're going to the pump we were saying why are these gas prices going up we were told that the inflation was transitory that was only going to be for a little bit first you told it wasn't happening then we were told that it was transitory and then suddenly this conflict breaks out in the region and we were told oh the reason why this is happening the reason why the gas prices are so high is because of Vladimir Putin and that of course didn't make any sense because it wasn't what we were told before that conflict ever broke out so it made me ask the question why are we why are we suddenly saying that but I want to go on he says here I want to make special notes of the fact that there is every reason to believe that the Western Elites are not going to look for constructive ways out of the global food and energy crisis that they and they alone are to blame for as a result of their long-term policy dating back long before our as refers to it special military operation in Ukraine I am afraid they would rather use other formulas they are more comfortable with and here it is important to recall that the West built itself out of its early 20th century challenges with World War One profits from World War II helped the United States finally overcome the Great Depression and become the largest economy in the world and to impose on the planet the power of the dollar as a global Reserve currency and the 1980s crisis things came to a head in the 1980s again the West emerged from an unscathed largely by appropriating The Inheritance and resources of the collapsed and defunct Soviet Union that's a fact now by the way he's saying that that's a fact I learned that from uh I learned that from a western book called the world for sale after the collapse of the Soviet Union a lot of our Traders went in obviously things were insane in those territories and they began moving oil out of the region so there is some Merit to that now if that's entirely what happened I couldn't say but like I said you could read the book it's called the world for sale and it talks about what happened with the collapse of the stone of the Soviet Union but here's where it gets especially interesting and where I want I want you to think about and I want you to write into the show and tell me what you think about it he goes on to talk about what he describes as this neo-colonial model right uh which is as he describes It ultimately doomed he says this but I repeat that it's real Masters will cling to it to the end they simply have nothing to offer the world except to maintain the same system of plundering and racketeering they do not give a damn about the natural right of billions of people the majority of humanity to freedom and Justice the right to determine their own future they have already moved on to the radical denial of moral religious and family values let's answer some very simple questions for ourselves he continues now I would like to return to what I said and I want to address also all citizens of the country not just the colleagues that are in the hall but all citizens of Russia do we want to have here in our country in Russia parent number one parents number two and parent number three instead of a mother and a father do we want our schools to impose on our children from their earliest days in school perversions that lead to degradation and Extinction do we want to drum into their heads the ideas that certain other genders exist along with women and men to offer them gender reassignment surgery is that what we want for our country and our children this is all unacceptable to us we have a different future of Our Own let me repeat that the dictatorship of the western Elites targets all societies including the citizens of Western countries themselves this is a challenge to all this complete renunciation of what it means to be human the overthrow of faith and Traditional Values and the suppression of Freedom are coming to resemble a religion in Reverse pure satanism that is interesting I'm going to stop there and ask you what you think about that because while I can't speak to the rest of a speech and obviously there's propaganda in this there's propaganda in our media there's propaganda in the west there's propaganda in the East what I can say is that this is an interesting question do we even want to have this sort of a society what does it mean when you have a leader like Putin attempting to Galvanize the people in this country by speaking to what are in fact evils in our country right the the idea that a leader is now using those evils to try to inspire people to get behind him right to to sort of declare war on Western ideology is problematic and we should talk about that because if we don't have the willingness to talk about that and we allow and we pretend it's normal right if we just say oh well it doesn't matter these are the rantings of a Madman does it matter that what he's saying is yes we are saying that children should be off offer gender reassignment surgery yes we are starting children on puberty blockers what we are doing is so evil that is allowing a bad person to point the finger at us and say are you with me are you with them and it is true that the people in our country who are speaking out against these Evils are being turned on by the media right when somebody stands up in our country and says no it's not okay to trans the kids no it's not okay to fundamentally alter the bodies of children we are referred to as transphobic right we are shut down our speech is shut down we are smeared um as as hateful bigots who just don't understand and then we're supposed to allow them to fly a banner that says Love Is Love No Love Is Love is not telling a child that they should alter their perfect little bodies um for an idea that will never manifest you cannot just think your way into a different gender again the reason why I want to point this out is because we are losing the moral High Ground in this country America is losing the moral High Ground right if this was a few decades ago and you heard Putin give a speech and say these sorts of things you would we would say we are a country with good values we are a country that believes in God we are a country that defends our children we are a country that teaches our children things of substance in the classrooms all of that has radically changed our value system at least the ones that they are trying that is coming from the top right the Department of Education attempting to cheat teach CRT critical race Theory attention attempting to teach children to judge one another based on the color of their skin you're either white and privileged or you're either black and you're oppressed this is not a society with good morals and if we don't have good morals right we cannot stand up in the world and say that we want to spread democracy that we want to spread our ideas the if the ideas are poisonous in America of course the ideas are going to be considered poisonous overseas we have to have the courage to talk about that because pretending that it's not happening and just saying Putin bad is not going to be a solution it's not going to be a long-term solution again I encourage you guys to read the speech in its entirety there are things that I fundamentally disagree with all throughout it but that part about saying that we are beginning to put forth a religion in Reverse which is pure Satanism as a Christian as a Christian that believes that Satan is the author of lies and deceptions I see that it is a satanic thing for us to tell children that they can pick their gender and I will continue to say that irrespective of whether or not that lands me wrongly assumed at least in the Press uh lands me as somebody who's going to be smeared as a Putin puppet as they like to say all of this to say obviously that our world is not just black and white it's important to continue to educate ourselves and to ask ourselves questions that make us uncomfortable and that's all I have to say about that all right guys before we continue I want to take a brief moment to talk to you about Legacy box Legacy box is the best and easiest way to digitally preserve your old tapes your films your pictures and your audio files they make it super

some topics to do [Music] you know the left just never misses an opportunity to just be disgusting you would think there could be one thing that might unite Americans it's a natural catastrophe right just a natural guitar there's nobody involved in making this thing happen like I don't know a hurricane a tornado hurricane Ian down in Florida took place in as I said the left can never waste an opportunity so rather than being decent human beings and saying you know what let's all get together and try to help all of these families to make sure that they have the resources that they need state aid federal aid of course the Biden Administration is thinking this is a good time to talk to people about climate change now let me make something clear if there wasn't a single human being on the face of the planet hurricanes would still happen like tornadoes would still happen like blizzards would still happen like rain would still happen like sleep would still happen like snow would still happen but now they have this all-catch phrase and every time a weather event takes place they start talking about climate change because ultimately what they want to do is convince people to give them more power right look the climate is changing the seasons are changing it's fall the leaves are coming down quick quick come hide behind government agree to give us more money to agree to more tax funding to ridiculous projects like the Paris Accord uh and uh see how it gets you absolutely nothing in return so yeah hurricane hurricane Ian obviously has been a natural catastrophe down in Florida and the byte Administration wasted no time Kamala Harris who is the least liked vice president of all time decided to attend an event for climate change and to speak about hurricane Ian with Priyanka Chopra who is an actress take a listen it is our lowest income communities and our communities of color that are most impacted by these extreme conditions and and impacted by by issues that are not of their own making and so we absolutely and so we have to address this in a way that is about giving resources based on Equity understanding that we we fight for equality but we also need to fight for Equity understanding not everyone starts out at the same place and if we want people to be in an equal Place sometimes we have to take into account those disparities um and and do that work foreign what giving resources based on equity what do we even what are we even talking about how did you just transform your first BS stance on climate change into a second BS stance on Equity so now what are we going to line people up and say oh well I'm sorry I see that your house has been taken out by Hurricane Ian but you're not black enough oh I'm sorry I see that um your entire life has been devastated by This Disaster but you're not a woman so you're not going to be able to help you yes she actually said this and of course people were understandably upset and understandably frustrated and the Press had an opportunity to ask her to clarify those comments and she decided to just completely ignore them take a listen to this foreign [Music] [Music] can you clarify what you meant about equity for Hurricane Relief [Music] you know you want to laugh but it is sad I think it's a sad circumstance when under no matter what takes place and this is by the way their same exact Mo when there's a school shooting that takes place rather than actually caring about the victims rather than actually caring about the students and their parents their first initiative is how do I secure more power for myself right the first thing they do is they get down they start talking about gun control and the legislation that they're going to pass just going to give the government more power and it's sad it's sad that we have become this overtly politicized that we can't take a step back and think about Americans first and foremost and together as one unit not left versus right so she continues to be as I said the least like vice president of all time don't really see that changing next up is a weird story and I I don't know why I was so interested in the story maybe because as you guys know my husband hosts poker matches once a month I do not know how to play poker whatsoever but I saw this Scandal breakout a young woman who also is new to Poker uh decided to play on Hustler Casino Live last Thursday and an entire Scandal broke out because she went all in to use a poker phrase which made she put all of her chips in on a weak hand a weekend a jack High hand and she won basically the odds were not in her favor at all and so people that were watching this online and she was up against a man named Garrett adelstein by the way and he believes that she cheated right so you see this moment which she kind of puts her hand down and she turns her ring around and then she comes back and she doubles and triples down in this hand and she wins 269 thousand dollars and the guy Garrett adelstein sort of says I don't know what's going on here and he suspects that she's using a vibration device on her finger and so after the game apparently which is we obviously could not see what happened he speaks to her and he says millions of people are going to watch what you did and she decides to give the money back to him which is completely bizarre if you won the hand fan fair and square why would you then give money back to the guy who you allegedly be and I was talking about this and realizing that we keep seeing these very Niche bizarre scandals right so this happened in the poker worlds a couple of weeks ago something similar happened in the Chess World where the best chess player in the entire world got beat uh by somebody that was younger and it was the same allegations they believe that he's using a vibration device to cheat and then I sort of thought about how sad that is that these sort of old school protected games right poker chess are now kind of being taken over by these allegations of cheating I don't know if that's a sign that people are becoming more and more desperate or people are just losing their integrity altogether right where you have these Sports if you will that are being watched and there are these various scandals after scandals and I thought it was interesting because it really is a marker that we no longer we no longer have a gentleman culture if you will I was thinking about this topic more uh and talk about with my husband of how much we have deviated away from gentleman culture think about a Time in America where we used to have duels where people would take it sounds ridiculous now but people would take couple of steps count their steps turn around and challenge each other to a duel whoever could fire first you think about that now and you think wow that those people must have been so honest that they took exactly the amount of steps and turned around nobody cheated and turned around and shot the other person because people had more Integrity back in the day and now today it seems at least obviously I don't know but you should go watch the clip of her with this ring and putting her hand and down and go look at that story of that kid who is uh somehow beating every chess player that's ever played the game and it does seem that it's because we don't have the same values anymore and so we cheat we cheat to get ahead we cheat to make money for her she's a brand new poker player but apparently she's good enough to beat Garrett adelstein so keep an eye on those stories I think that they're super interesting jumping in to the next story and this one makes me so angry you will recall during the George Floyd riots notoriously there were those two lawyers those two graduates honestly if I remember correctly I think she was a Yale graduate or she was at least in school to be a lawyer at Yale University and during the George Floyd riots this woman a Rouge Ramen through a Molotov cocktail into a police cruiser in New York it completely torched the NYPD but troll car and she is now obviously she has a trial now she's going through it and she's whining she's basically saying that she should be completely allowed off because she was drunk and dealing with unprocessed trauma I mean if that just doesn't sound like just complete crap I was dealing with unprocessed trauma at the time so I threw a Molotov cocktail into the police cruiser and what really made me so angry about this particular story and I followed it and I reported on it at the time was the fact that she only spent 28 days in Brooklyn federal jail before she posted 250 000 bail and that infuriated me because just a few months later obviously January 6th right when they were locking people up for months on end because they walked through the Capitol Building I mean I'm talking about there was a high school student who I had covered who had spent months months in prison longer than this woman had spent and he was not guilty of any violence he did not throw a Molotov cocktail into police police cruiser but he was on the wrong side because he was a conservative and he walked into the Capitol building and yet this woman spent just 28 days her Loyals her lawyers pardon me contended that she had been Downing vodka on an empty stomach on that day and so she was really drunk and she had this unprocessed trauma and she also among other excuses she had been in abusive Partnerships in the past oh and she also as another excuse they gave she was Muslim in America during 9 11. so there's a lot of trauma going on which led her to this moment where she threw a Molotov cocktail into a police cruiser thankfully there were no police officers in there or else they would have wound up dead but these are the excuses that she's giving I mean they're just so bratty right just let me off I'm I I'm I have unprocessed trauma and I was drinking on an empty stomach if this flies and I'm going to bet that it will we really should be infuriated I'm already infuriated but if this if they let her off and this judge actually takes a look at these pathetic excuses and allows her to face no consequences allows her to serve no prison time which is what she is asking for and then it will really show you just how politicized our courts have become just how politicize that if you are a leftist you can get away with anything literally almost murder right she she could have killed police officers but if you're on the right God forbid you walk within the capital that your tax dollars are paying for moving on to this next strange story uh we have Nancy Pelosi who claimed that illegal immigrants need to stay in Florida to ready pick crops down here here is her at a press conference on Friday take a listen we have a shortage of workers in our country and you see even in Florida some of the farmers in the Growers saying why are you shipping these immigrants up north we need them to pick the crops down here yeah we just casually just like could you imagine by the way if Trump had said that this is just so casually yeah we need these illegals to pick the crops down here we have a shortage so we're going to need them to come down here and do some field work it's just amazing I don't know if it's just because if she's so old that she gets away with just sort of saying whatever she wants you do get to a point where you're just so old and you can just say whatever you want you know like Grandma say whatever they want but this is pretty bad but this is what they actually think by the way every single time they talk about the illegal immigrants they keep talking about the jobs that nobody wants right they keep saying essentially that we need these people to do these jobs that nobody wants we need them to pick the crops and it's just interesting because for whatever reason the Press just allows them to get away with it the left is always allowed to speak their implicit racism boldly on camera and at press conferences but God forbid if a conservative a Ted Cruz a Donald Trump or any other person on the right ever spoke like that they would never we would never hear the end of it there would be wall-to-wall coverage of it all right moving on Biden recently thanked a Coast Guard rescue swimmer uh for his work during Hurricane Ian he rescued a lot of people and so Biden gave him a phone call and thanked him small catch that same person is about to be fired by Biden because he is refusing to get the vaccine so yes the White House publicized this call in a press release and Biden bragged about calling this guy and oh they're doing all the all that they're doing to to save lives it's so wonderful what what these people are doing to save lives Yes actually uh Joe Biden and I tend to agree with you on that so why are you forcing them to get a vaccine to keep their jobs this is still going on it's it's so ridiculous by the way in just traveling yesterday to Paris and seeing that suddenly it's covered no more right now you can travel wherever you want the airport was completely packed I mean it was like person to person because the flights were running late everyone's laying you know I'm talking about people are laying on the ground at the airport no one's got a mask on it's hot it's humid you're thinking wow I thought I thought kovid this would have been a huge threat to coven now it's just no more nobody cares right you want the show any covered backs cards you guys know but I'm not vaccinated I'm allowed into Paris I can leave Paris I can go back to America but still this is going on we still have the our members that are serving that are being told that if they refuse the vaccine they are no longer going to be able to serve this country why what what game are we playing anymore when the people that should be the most valued are being told that they are not needed unless they agree to roll up their sleeves and submit to I don't know what are we number one two three four how many vaccines we're on today they're being told that and so this Coast Guard rescue swimmer is about to lose his job and when he was asked about that he said quote it just sucks that he thanked me yet the vaccine mandate is what's kicking me out I just love my job and I'm really good at it it sucks I feel like this is the job that I was born to do yeah it does suck it doesn't just suck for him it sucks for us as well because we are use we are losing a lot of good men and women in the armed forces uh and it's all due to this arbitrary idea that for whatever reason they should have to submit their healthy bodies to faux science the faux pseudoscience that is fauci and the Biden Administration colluding to make more Americans take this vaccine all right ladies and gentlemen that is all I have to say about that as you know the remainder portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I will be giving you guys my thoughts on infant circumcision since somebody had a question about that so if you're not yet a member go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "uLbaSFg44Mo": "all right ladies and gentlemen this is one of my favorite parts of the show where i get to hear from you guys back at home and provide you with answers so let's dive right into your questions first question is from vanessa she asks now that winnie the pooh is public domain the story is being turned into a horror slasher film what are your thoughts on the public domain and do you think this corrupts winnie the pooh my thoughts are of course it corrupts winnie the pooh and that's the point and if there's been one theme in this episode if there's been one theme in our society it's that we are a society that is inching closer and closer closer to normalizing violence um so it makes perfect sense that the first idea someone has is to turn it into a slasher film and it's unfortunate because you know that is such a classic winnie the pooh everyone grew up listening watching winnie the pooh having winnie the pooh stuffed animals and it's a huge reason why i am so concerned as a parent with my child watching tv my child is almost 16 months and he still has not watched any television because i can't trust what's on tv every everything has become corrupted even the ones that aren't as obvious when you see this introduction of the trans and the gay agenda everywhere when you hear disney executives talking about oh we're going to uh just make everything gay and make you know just try to make everything trans everywhere um it's an unfortunate society for our children to grow up in and i think it's incumbent upon parents to just simply acknowledge that this is where we're at next question why do you think school shootings happen mostly in america as opposed to other countries even the most violent ones what logical steps can the united states take in reducing or ending them without infringing on the rights of its citizens um i think the answer to that is because america has become an increasingly faithless society has become an increasingly spineless society and a lot of that is due to the fact that we worship hollywood um you know the bible talks extensively about idolatry and i always encourage people that even if you're not religious you should just read the bible objectively um as if it's just a book and it's just incredible how many times you're gonna go bam that's right bam that's right bam that's right when you have a society that's completely faithless you should know that it isn't actually faithless so let me try to explain that thought um we live in a society that's increasingly more atheistic but there's no such thing as an absence of faith it's always a conversion of faith and what i mean by that is that people begin worshiping climate change and people begin worshiping black lives matter people begin worshiping celebrities and celebrities tell them oh you know you should abort your children my nine months in the womb and they don't know what to do with that information other than to say okay okay well i like taylor swift so i must also like all of her ideas about what i should be doing and i should be marching for my body my choice um even in societies that we know that are violent like you're talking about i presume in the middle east right for example the taliban they have faith it's the reason why they beat us in afghanistan because they believe in something and our society believes in nothing but these causes that come around um and they're fleeting and they're momentary it's your black lives matter flag that turns into your ukraine flag that turns into your dr fauci flag we're faithless right um and that's why it was you know a pleasure to be able to host jonathan isaac today on the show and to talk to him extensively about why his faith has been important um in tethering him to a sense of reality next question this one is from tyler in oklahoma and he asks did you see obama's tweet saying that we should take time to remember george floyd as we grieve the kids shot in texas yes i did see the tweet and i really have nothing more to say than obama's gotta obama this this is why he was put in the white house you know it's what he does he's like whoa oh i see you getting ahead of yourselves and you're being upset about something and i see the nation potentially coming together on on a certain topic and grieving but let me remind you that we should still hate white people thanks obama all right next question who would win in a fight matt walsh or a bear i'm gonna go with definitely a bear because a bear drinks natural spring water and matt walsh drinks tosani water and that can't be helping him he's basically poisoning himself he's not going to stand a chance against the bear and i don't care about any of you big baby gang squad whatever you guys call yourselves i don't care about your opinion about that i'm sticking to it matt walsh is a bad person who drinks sasani water final question what would you do if your child told you that they were gay wow um okay this is a great question i'm only laughing because i've been saying to my husband that is so funny to me that people that are upset about my perspectives about the increasing alphabet soup lbgtqia um and all of the nonsense that derives from it always when they mean tweet me say i hope your son grows up to be trans and they mean it as an insult so it's kind of one of the greatest self owns when you say that and you mean that as a pejorative and as an insult but regarding the topic of gay i had a very fascinating conversation um years ago that i didn't fully understand and i have been able to comprehend it more as time has gone by with a gay man who i work with he's a conservative and he i say he's a conservative because he believes that it is the act of having sex um that the bible speaks out against so he is he's very formed in his ideas surrounding gay and decide and surrounding um sorry surround sorry so he's very well formed in his ideas regarding the lgbtq agenda and it's interesting to hear it from his perspective as somebody who is a gay man but won't have gay sex and something that he said to me was that throughout his entire life he felt that of all of the gay people that he had been around um perhaps five percent of them were actually gay and the other 95 percent either had daddy issues or were just being a part of a society that suddenly started celebrating gayness and i thought that was a really strange thing to say until the trans thing started right until we went from a society where i didn't graduate with a single individual that was trans and some people might say oh it's because they weren't comfortable coming out as trans well they should feel comfortable now obviously and they still are not trans so we had some gay kids we had some lesbian kids we didn't have any trans kids and now you're looking over in california and you've got an explosion of children that believe that they're gay and i think this is what he was talking about which is that the society has actually been programming children to think you can pick your gender and he was talking about when he was growing up this there was a big gay push right so you had the explosion in the 90s ellen degeneres came out as she was gay and it was this big cultural iconic moment melissa etheridge just big cultural iconic moment and then suddenly society said gay is now a narrative and it's the reason why when you look at these rates of you know the lgbtq community in other countries they're just not as high as it is in america so that's just kind of me giving you my thoughts on me thinking that there's probably a lot less gay people and a lot less transgender people that are living in this country um you know i think for me if my son who is very clearly already at 16 months not gay i mean he could not be more masculine or want to run out into the world if i let him go fight in a war in a pamper right now he would do it um but you know in a wild imaginative scenario i think you just have to cross that bridge um when you get there and i would definitely want to make sure that it was not a circumstance where you had an adult in his life that was influencing him to believe that he was gay you didn't have a grooming situation that was happening in the classroom and it's why i encourage adults to really pay attention to what is happening all around your children not just in your household because as i always say right now we are in a fight for custody with the state over our children and the lesbian gay and trans agenda queer agenda is a

lock step when it comes to Parenting talking points it's almost as if somebody is telling them what to say it's almost as if they sound like I don't know Mockingbirds plus coming up we're going to talk about Casey Anthony she's back in the news and is now claiming that her father killed her daughter to cover up his sexual abuse so that story is getting pretty convoluted all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] foreign so I feel pretty comfortable stating that if the entire mainstream media Network is for or against something you should probably edit your opinions to be the opposite of what theirs is because it's pretty clear that they don't actually have any individual opinions these journalists right they're always in lockstep on various narratives as just one example of course most recent one being covet it just seems impossible that suddenly they were selling every single individual fear none of them got curious about anything they were not curious about how it was if they had worked for example at CNN for so many years and suddenly CNN was able to do a live ticker of deaths like somehow CNN had access to those files and we're getting all the data and every day they were terrifying Americans saying if you go outside and if you touch your door handle you're going to die of covet and nobody wanted to investigate that just trust trust trust the experts trust Dr fauci none of them were interested in looking into Dr fauci they just said listen to him do whatever he says another example which I thought was immediately suspicious and I I'm not going to taste my hill to die on one of my many Hills to die on zelenski the Ukraine war every war ever it does seem that the media is in lockstep telling us that we need to feel really bad for people somewhere else and that we need to understand that a part of us feeling bad means that our taxpayer dollars has to be extracted and wealth needs to leave America so yeah it does sound like they are a bunch of mockingbirds which is appropriate of course because that was the CIA program title it was called operation Mockingbird you are not a conspiracy theorist for knowing the truth and you are correct if you know about the Mockingbird being something that the CIA has never discontinued so first and foremost in case you are not aware of what operation Mockingbird was and still is it was a large scale project undertaken by the CIA beginning in the 1950s in which they recruited American journalists into a propaganda Network the recruited journalists were put on payroll by the CIA which means me and you we paid for that and instructed to write fake stories that promoted the views of the intelligence agencies so some journalists were accessed to the CIA and were on the payroll other journalists were unsuspecting assets of the CIA because they thought that they had a leak that they were being given information and they ran with the stories because they thought they were being told the truth in fact take a listen to a former CIA agent discuss just that you briefed the Press did you not when you were there well I had several jobs one of my jobs was that of analysts I also was an interrogator and indeed briefed the Press when we the CIA wanted to circulate this information on a particular issue this information is not necessarily not necessarily A Lie it may be a half truth and we would pick out a journalist I would go do the briefing and hope that he would put the information in print for instance if we wanted to get across to the American public that the North Vietnamese were building up their Force structure in South Vietnam I would go to a journalist and advise him that in the past six months X number of North Vietnamese forces had come down the Ho Chi Minh trail system through southern Laos now there is no way a journalist can check that information so either he goes with the information or he doesn't and ordinarily or usually the journalists would go with it because it was it looked like some kind of exclusive and um I would say our percentage planning that kind of data was uh 70 to 80 percent the correspondence we targeted were those who had terrific influence the most uh respected journalists in Saigon like Robert Chaplin of the New Yorker magazine Kai's Beach the Los Angeles Times from time to time and also he worked for the Chicago Daily News um Bud Merrick of U.S news and World Report Malcolm Brown of the New York Times even Maynard Parker of Newsweek magazine we would go after these gentlemen I would be directed to cultivate them to spend time with them at the caravel hotel or the Continental Hotel to socialize with them and and slowly but surely to try to gain their confidence by dolloping out valid information information which was true and then I would drop in into a conversation the data that we wanted to get across which might not be true one piece of data for instance that we managed to plan in the New Yorker magazine had to do with supposed North Vietnamese effort in 1973 to develop airfields along the border of South Vietnam the reason we wanted to plant this information was that we were trying to persuade the U.S Congress that Saigon should be continued to should continue to get a great deal of Aid and that the North Vietnamese were the chief violators of the ceasefire Accord that was printed in uh the New Yorker magazine under the byline of Robert Chaplin as indeed was a great deal of such information which which we trying to circulate so there you have it half truths and disinformation being circulated by the CIA initiatives that they set forth that would help them in their agenda in addition by the way which is insane to me student cultural organizations and magazines were allegedly funded as fronts for this operation so you know when you see a bunch of kids and they get all fired up and then suddenly they're out protesting and you're like what what happened here how is every student organization on all of these campuses suddenly in lockstep on a certain narrative it seems a little bit bizarre right kids should be a little more individual than that but we know these college campuses they seem to be kind of mass producing children with the same ideas which is again a very bizarre thing so yes the CIA was on college campuses I think it's part of the reason that when you're in high school they encourage students to go to college it's not because college is making children smarter no it's actually making them Dumber they're coming out of College University and having paid 100 000 and putting themselves into student loan debt they look you in the face and they tell you that there's infinite amount of genders somebody should request a refund so yeah this operation took place and of course don't worry guys they had Congressional hearings about it and they're not happy to find out of course Congress always has these these shows of pretending they're going to do something about it learning that a propaganda network is operating under the auspices of the United States government but of course nothing actually happens and again no official end to this program now why am I bringing this up today well because for whatever reason we obviously know that the CIA did not want Donald Trump to become the president of the United States I think whatever the reason is because he was out of their control not out of control but out of their control and they had already decided as I believe the CIA does that Hillary Clinton was their candidate Hillary Clinton would have worked as their puppet and would have done whatever she wanted them to do I believe that these people have way more power than the president does in this circumstance and I was thinking about this also as it relates to Donald Trump because obviously as we all know he is has now officially announced that he is running for president of the United States again and you can imagine that the media is already getting ready to kind of step up and say this man cannot become president and one of the ways in which they are doing this is by furthering division within the conservative movement in general right so you're kind of seeing the media jump on this Narrative of trying to put DeSantis versus Trump and encouraging the supporters to be the same they're basically saying that you need to decide whether you're team DeSantis or whether you're team Trump which is odd because the sanus has not indicated even once that he's running for president so why are we even having these sorts of discussions who is seeding our ideas who is turning us all into Mockingbirds so to speak and believing that we need to all be just discussing this really non-existent rift at the moment perhaps later down the line Trump knows more than we know and the Santa is planning on running but at the moment it doesn't really make sense and then I noticed last week when I did a monologue and I was unpacking my honest opinion about Trump which is that he's gotten too angry he's gotten too angry is it understandable that he's angry yes of course if you can imagine what it's like having to fight the institutions like the CIA and the FBI and people that are trying to make your life a living hell day in and day out who have the power to make your life a living hell right people like attorney general Leticia James in New York who just said that's the guy and I'm just going to look for the crime that he committed and just launched an investigation into the entire Trump organization and she said that she was just gonna get him on something and by golly she did right she filed charges against them imagine what that's like day in and day out it's going to turn you into an angry individual but I want him to remember how to have fun because that is the reason that America fell in love with him it was the jokes it was him calling things out as they were and so I said this then I was so much surprised to see first and foremost the news articles that came out Candace Owens turns her back on Trump what were you talking about I didn't say I turned my back on him I said something that is true a he needs to answer for the entire catastrophe of covid vaccines which he was very supportive of and he should not have been supportive as supportive as he was in my opinion and I think that he should have listened to his supporters concerns as opposed to trumpeting the vaccine and I think that he should have been more careful in listening to his supporters concerns of why they were hesitant and what effects they were having after the vaccine so I say that and they say oh my gosh she's against him and then I say he should be less angry and it's it did seem like a Mockingbird project I was like that's very weird I never said anything about maturing against him but they're going along with this narrative causing people that follow me to question whether or not I'm in on operation Mockingbird people were actually commenting saying I can't believe you turned your back on this that woman Jenna Ellis who I've unfortunately had on the show made it seem oh Candace is turning her back on Trump everyone's retweeting this narrative that I turn him back on Trump when in reality what I'm actually saying is to help him you want to be a serious Contender for 2024 you need to bring the party back together that was standing behind you right now those people are feeling very very I guess almost I would say that's a trepidation in the air right there's a trepidation in the air about how much big Pharma almost seized from them and he's going to have to address that that is me trying to help Trump and I thought okay that's weird and I'm getting attacked and it doesn't matter I'm always getting attacked for stuff but I didn't say but I just saw it recently happen and I can't believe I'm gonna have to do this but I'm going to have to defend Tomi lahren because it had Candace had just finished trending on Twitter saying a Candace turned you back on down Trump and then suddenly I saw that Tommy Lauren was trending on Twitter for another 24 hours and they were saying the exact same stuff they said Tommy Lauren turned her back on Trump she's beginning to have doubts about Donald Trump and then predictably the wave of not but never trumpers but the always trumpers the always trumpers equally as Toxic by the way as the never trumpers because their stance at the moment is you can't say anything but glowing reviews about Trump or your anti-trump which is not true if you are a serious person and you want him to win then you have to critique why people are breaking from his party to help him okay so they came after Tommy and I actually said let me listen to what Tommy Lauren actually said did she actually turn her back on Donald Trump is that true is the media being honest here's what she actually said in her own words I just want to pause for a second and read you a tweet from Senator Josh Hawley he said the old party is dead time to bury it build something new Tommy a lot of Republican voters are feeling that way but then we have to consider a whole new mess that's probably coming our way if we have a trump announcement this week and we're going to talk about that later but if we're thinking we're divided now between McConnell and Rick Scott and all the rest of it wait until Donald Trump's name is back in the running officially I know he's been hinting at it for a long time but when it's officially there not only will that impact Georgia likely it's going to be whether Democrats hate Donald Trump or Republicans love Donald Trump enough to push Georgia over the line but there's going to be a lot of issues in the Republican party that we have two years to sort out we better start today I completely agree with everything that Tommy Lauren said there we have issues that we are going to need to sort out within the Republican Party issues which I've just highlighted to you that there Trump lost a lot of supporters because of his vaccine stance he also lost a lot of donors because of his vaccine stance how do we sort that out by talking about that by not pretending that like it's not happening which is what people want us to do they want to pretend like oh it doesn't matter any of those people that aren't with him because of the vaccine stuff they weren't real trumpers right it's like it's like gang stuff now it's like Bloods and Crips it's like the real trumpers don't even care about his vaccine stance and they understand they're sticking with him it's like no that's not how we're going to bring the party together we're going to bring the party together by Trump being a leader and addressing those concerns saying hey I was working perhaps this is what he might say I was working to the best of my ability with the knowledge that I had and yes I was happy to get these vaccines out because I was being told that this was going to be something like the Bubonic plague which was true that's what he was being told right by operation Mockingbird mainstream media was actually acting as this as if kovid was going to wipe out Humanity but it is not leadership to pretend that these separations in the GOP aren't actually happening and so the attacks on Tom mulerin are wrong and the attacks on me are wrong and the attacks on a bunch of individuals who clearly have had nothing but support and love for Trump Brandon Tatum being another person are all just blatantly wrong right and I wanted to bring them to your attention because if we are serious again now that Trump has indicated that he is running officially if we are serious about being a United party behind Trump then we're going to have to have the courage to have these discussions that we can bring people back together and that's all that I'm going to say about that there is no reason to pay Verizon ATT and T-Mobile over 80 a month for wireless Services when you can get the same service on the same network at Pure Talk for half the price with pure talk you can get talk text and data that's just as fast for just 30 dollars a month those other guys are making you pay for thousands of retail stores that you don't go to perks that you don't use and massive profits to keep their shareholders happy Pure Talk on the other hand wants wants to keep you happy which is why they've invested a us-based customer service team it's also why they give you so many more data options because why would they charge you for data that you don't need I like pure talk because I like supporting veteran-owned us-based companies that have my best interests at heart it takes less than 10 minutes to make the switch and you're going to save a ton of money now is your chance to show Corporate America that you're done funding their leftist ideologies go to puretalk.com and enter code Owens to save 50 off your first month that's puretalk.com promo code Owens for 50 off your first month okay now it's time for some topics du jour [Music] okay first up Casey Anthony I'm sure that name is ringing a bell of course how could anybody forget the infamous Casey Anthony case now I'm not allowed to say that she's a murderer because she was infamously acquitted of murdering her two-year-old daughter in 2011 but what I can say I think legally is that I believe nothing that comes out of this woman's mouth at all have not believed her from the very beginning and I still don't believe her today despite this she is making a reappearance in the news because she has taken place in a three-part docu-series on peacock which will be her first sit-down interview and she is going to blame her father George for the 2008 murder of her daughter Kaylee and she suggests that he may have killed her to cover up sexually abusing her and she also is going to make the claim again that she has no idea what happened in the interview she claims that both she and her daughter were sexually abused by her father and she claimed that in the past she was abused by her father and her brother games in which they have both vehemently denied neither of them has ever been charged in connection with the allegations nor have either of them been implicated in Kaylee's death doesn't matter not going to stop her from coming back now I just want to remind you about a couple of facts pertaining uh to this case it took Casey Anthony 31 days to call the police and to tell them that Kaylee was missing so there is my earlier analysis of me not believing a word that comes out of her mouth I'm a mother I'm a mother to an almost two-year-old the idea that it would take me 31 days to not to think to call the police or to to alert the authorities to the fact that he was missing just not imaginable you're just not going to convince me that that was an actual plausibility and that things somehow were tricky and that you didn't say everything you had to say throughout your entire child beyond that I will remind you that it was Casey's mother not Casey herself that first alerted the authorities to Kaylee's appearance her mother's name is Cindy it was her her and her husband George had not seen Casey or Kaylee for a month and then they found Casey's car in a tow yard and George said that the smell of the car took his breath away in his 9-1-1 call Cindy told the dispatcher Kaylee's missing it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car okay so that is just giving you a little reminder of what went on during that case and for whatever reason she never thought to contact the authorities we found out then throughout the trial that she liked to party a lot obviously she was a very young mom and I don't know what the purpose is of this I don't peacock obviously the purpose is money but also to what try to appeal to our senses and make us think that we should be there's more to the story that wasn't presented in court and that perhaps maybe she had nothing to do with this and she just mystery seriously just didn't think to call the authorities when her daughter was missing for 31 days I'm not going for it but I'm just reporting to let you guys know that um yeah that is a topic of the day today you are going to be seeing and hearing more from Casey Anthony in case you were missing her for any reason next story and it's not a very surprising one not exactly breaking any news here you just have to have you know a capacity to think it turns out that people that are leaving the trans Community are describing the trans Community as cult-like yeah once you leave they want violence they're angry at you how dare you you are doing nothing to justify their narrative that men can be women and women can be men and when people obviously go through the extremes of attempting that feat and then they say uh oh I've got a little bit of buyer's remorse you wake up and you say hey I think I want my private parts back and they become vocal and talk about this as abuse because it is abuse well it turns out that people that are still trans turn on them and go oh my God how dare you how dare you pretend that our Phantom indices aren't real so those individuals who are detransitioning I don't even like that because you never really did transition but they're being described as D transitioners are saying that they're experiencing death threats and doxing and intimidation and that they're being accused of genocide from cult-like from the cult-like transgender community and this should surprise nobody I have said there is no community that is more vicious there was no Lobby that is more vicious than the LBGTQ rstuv wxy and Z Lobby I have seen this myself the way they come at you with a way that is so toxic in fact uh rather notoriously Matt Walsh went through all of these death threats for doing his documentary what is a woman he went through he had to experience all of this and people were fearful for him and his family at that time because he just explored the reality of a trans movement and it makes sense that this is a community to be fearful of because you have to have such a tremendous mental disorder right a very serious mental disorder to do what these these individuals are doing right what would make you want to mutilate your own body to make it impossible right for you to potentially have a productive family in the future you have to be so radically transformed by an ideology and you believe in this ideology so much for you to go through with what is really accountable what really we should be calling human experimentation that's what it is it's human experimentation and then when somebody comes to you with some reality of like hey man you actually can't pick your gender of course you're going to become violent you are you are committed to this ideology by any means necessary so yes a bunch of d transitioners as they are known are talking about the online vitriol and the harassment and the death threats that they are receiving and there are now all of these tensions between trans activists and these D transitioners and it really spiked this month at a meeting of Florida's medical board where sex change interventions for children were restricted there were a bunch of insult insults that were being hurled and bomb threats that were posted online because how dare the medical board even talk about this trans rights activists shouted over their opponents at the hearings they called people bigots and said shame on all of you they vowed to dox the board members by publishing their private phone numbers and releasing other details about them online so yeah be very careful tread very carefully if you're going to go out there and say biology is real and that only women can give birth and that men can't be women and women can't be men be very careful out there guys it is getting real there's also a Reddit thread and in the Reddit category if you guys know how Reddit works you can find your community well there is a community that is called d-trans so people can come together and talk to each other about these various issues here is just one example on the d-trans thread on Reddit somebody wrote I'm so bitter the trans Community says that if you detransition and regret what you did to yourself you have no one to blame but you but I was 10 I was 10 years old obese and already looked more like a boy than a girl I despised myself the internet told me that this was the way out gave me tips on hiding from my parents who wanted nothing but for me to not make a huge mistake I'm 17 now my breasts are completely stunted I have a severe eating disorder and I've never had a boyfriend I ruined myself at 10 years old and the community that once encouraged me now turns their backs and ridicules me I am so bitter that's heartbreaking it is heartbreaking and the entire ecosystem that supported this young girl and told her that she should take part in ruining her body and ruining herself they should face prison sentences I honestly believe that people should be in prison for what they are doing to Children it is child abuse in the highest form in fact saying child abuse doesn't even seem to do it justice alright so it's no secret that inflation continues to be a plague on our economy our families and our savings and irresponsible Democrat spending continues to exacerbate the problem now is not the time to be over leveraged in the stock market or to let your savings weather away

get into because it's ridiculous imagine if you are a sign language interpreter and you are working on The Lion King on Broadway and then you're fired you say why am I fired what did I do wrong and they tell you well you're white so that's what you did wrong it's 2022 being white sometimes can be a crime a lot of times it can be a crime you just don't have you don't look the part of what we want to see here well that is what Keith Wan is saying happened to him he is 53 years old and he was one of at least two people that were forced off the production by the non-profit theater Development Fund which staffs Broadway shows with American Sign Language interpreters after the group decided that it was quote no longer appropriate to have white interpreters represent black characters for ASL Broadway shows so I guess that would mean he was representing a black character simply because he was signing what the black character was saying and so they decided that he must be fired and we instead much reach in to the ASL black community because that would somehow be more appropriate so obviously they're going to be sued for this actually we do have laws in place that don't allow for that blatant sort of racial discrimination because racial discrimination doesn't just happen one way despite what you've been told by the mainstream media narrative racial discrimination in my honest estimation happens more often than not against white people in this Society thanks to BLM and the operation Mockingbird narrative which told us that being white was a form of evil and we needed to be addressed all the time so in today's society yes we have racism that is operating toward white people and Juan is a victim of this and he has done the right thing by filing a federal discrimination lawsuit on Tuesday against the organization and the director of its accessibility programs Lisa Carling Lisa Carling I don't know what race she is but I do know that she is an absolute idiot and that whatever comes her way is absolutely deserved in terms of this lawsuit I'm expecting him to win Carling told both him and another interpreter whose name was Christina to back out of the show which celebrates its 25th anniversary on Sunday so that they could be replaced by black sign language experts that's according to the suit and the emails which were in fact obtained by the post and verified um Juan as I said he is a sign language interpreter and a performer he's been working in New York for more than a decade was offered the chance in March to work on this amazing show and then just a couple of days later he was shocked when he received the email sheepishly which Carlin sheepishly said hey why don't you just leave the show and what she said in the email he should step away from his job because of the quote-unquote current social climate yeah so that is a real thing we will keep up to date on the story and inform you to see if it gets even dumber but I don't see how it possibly could when you just start firing people on the basis of their skin color you're you're pretty dumb next thing I want to talk to you guys about because it just made me laugh I just don't know why I just I just laughed when I saw the story um it was a Chinese Grandpa and he has redefined smoking he really has honestly take a look at this photo it's incredible he decided to run an entire Marathon 26 miles he ran while puffing away on cigarettes and not only did he run this he ran it in just three and a half hours the photos are amazing amazing if you're listening to the podcast please do go find this he's just chiefing he's just running and he's smoking and I say why not right I think I really do think that what happened to Big tobacco is something for the books Once Upon a Time Of course you felt it was deserved they were causing a bunch of people to have cancer and it was a good thing that we said no smoking and by the way the results of that the powerful campaign against big tobacco people in America do not smoke anywhere near as much as people overseas and I'm always shocked by that whenever I go to Europe that they still very much have a smoking culture there you don't see that as much in America what I will say is that there was this huge initiative against big tobacco only to be followed by this strange world where we now are telling people as did the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine that fat is healthy right telling people that they should get backed up even if it causes myocarditis telling people that masking children is somehow saving lives it's just not so and when there's no science I say anything goes so kudos to this Chinese man who's cheap in cigarettes and still somehow running a marathon in under three and a half hours ladies and gentlemen that's all I have to say about that all right guys the holiday season is upon us and I am fired up is my favorite time of year and I especially look forward to all of the cooking and the baking even

delivered okay now it's time for your comments I shouldn't make time for this but I'm going to make time for this as long as you guys are nice first comment this is from somebody responding to me covering the story about the woman who helped her daughter marry her stepbrother and I just think it's a little too close for comfort Moon beamstree disagrees moon beam Street says I don't think Candace realizes how common it is already and frankly when not blood related and not raised together it's not weird relatives share similarity in pheromones that a separate set of relatives will be attracted to it's not at all uncommon for sisters to date a pair of brothers a mom and daughter falling for a man and his son doesn't need anyone's attention um you are correct Color Me uneducated on this topic I don't know a single person not even a person of a friend of a friend of a friend of a cousin of a cousin a cousin who has dated uh stepbrother or a step sister it's just kind of one of those things I think is recognized as without an official reason yes you're correct if you're not blood relatives why not but I think people just think you know what seven to eight billion people in the world maybe I can just find someone else without making this tricky and weird and having to send out invites and saying well the whole family's getting married now I still think it's a bit weird I just that is my personal inkling about it and that's why I covered it but thank you for your feedback next comment is regarding assisted suicide something that I'm staunchly against and that I keep talking about on the show because it's going to become a big Topic in the next coming years Molly writes it's sad but I think assisted suicide should have been an option in any country we put our animals to sleep when we know that they're in pain and suffering because we don't want them to go through all of that what's so different about doing the same with people I've watched my family members and a few friends mostly cancer diagnosis but a couple had other debilitating illnesses I watched them lay in hospital beds wasting away to Skin and Bones staying up there in pain and since there's no other options at that point other than making them comfortable but whatever meds they give they were still in so much pain we should be able to say enough is enough when it gets to the point that your doctor says there's nothing else to do but to make you comfortable your family shouldn't have to watch you die a slow painful death I agree that people should not die a slow painful death I think it's sad to make people watch others die a slow painful death but I think what you're missing is that these topics of a suicide that I'm giving you is not are not people in Canada that are dying a slow painful death this is why I keep telling you it's always this is how the left does it they give you something and you go oh this could kind of be normal and this is a situation where it could be normal and then you wind up with circumstances like the ones that I presented to you of two healthy women that had absolutely nothing wrong with them coming out of California booking a flight to Switzerland and killing themselves in their 30s this is where it's a slippery slope you're going to start convincing people teenagers that's not worth living right you're going to start to see this sort of execution happen against trans people once they realize they can't have any children they're going to say oh well you know your life is over and you're depressed so go kill yourself and those have been the examples that I have given at the Forefront and it always it always starts with that small little window that's all the government needs it's a small window to justify to you of why it's okay for us to have assisted suicide but believe me it is not going to be the discussion is not going to be just about people that are struggling and that are in pain regarding your topic about putting animals down I think I have a lot to say about that I the whole Market of animals and Medicine don't know about that I just I'm gonna leave that there I just don't know about that it seems like the ultimate hustle okay next comment is coming from somebody who is commenting regarding Dr Carson's explanation of why black people seem to constantly be warned with one another who talked about slavery and how they would intentionally keep the Masters control over the Slaves by saying well you're better because you're a house negro or you're better than him because he's a field negro yada yada this person says your comment about Dr Carson's explanation turned on a light bulb in my head I've never looked into the historic beliefs behind different positions or hierarchy within the black community so hearing that explanation was intriguing I used the word intriguing specifically here as a positive word because it made me think and pose a question my entire working life has had the unspoken rule that those who work in the corporate office are better than those who work in the local office are better than those who work in the shop are better than those who work outside I'm a landscaping crew maybe this isn't a black problem about a human problem that's very thoughtful and I agree yeah of course I think for any society or any group of individuals that seek to have control over a bunch of other people it's best to keep them warring and so yes in that conversation with Dr Ben Carson we were specifically talking about the maintenance of the slave plantation which I think is the reason that black Americans still have such toxicity between one another which I spoke about in a different episode but it can be expanded and it is yeah the idea that people who work in New York City and write blogs about the rest of the world are somehow better than the people that work with their hands on farms and they're not they're actually Dumber they're not better than them but we've convinced ourselves that somehow having a college degree which is completely meaningless in most circumstances somehow makes you better than somebody who doesn't have a college degree but knows how to work with their hands so you are correct and hinting at that next question this person says sincere question your show from today got me thinking why does there need to be such a thing as black culture as far as I can tell there's no such thing as white culture there was American culture but I wouldn't say race plays into that I know lots of white people and we only share culture in the most shallow sense I have more in common with you than I do with most of them as I live in the very blue State of Rhode Island America is somewhat unique in that we are the Melting Pot or at least that was the idea historically speaking but what about other countries is it about majority versus minority if I was a white person living in a predominantly black nation in Africa would I feel the need for a white culture is that a thing in those places how about if I was a white person living in China or in India what about blacks living there still a need for Black Culture there are minorities in America who retain some of their own cultures but there seems to be other factors at play here I am thinking of Asian Indian and Hispanics I would have to say it seems to do more with Nations as the Hispanics I know have quite a lot of variants based on the country of origin I work for a corporation that is so drunk on diversity that there are 13 different languages represented there they bend over backwards to hire people of color and immigrants and women of course everyone is expected to speak English at work but some are better than others I can assure you in that case of communication diversity is not their strength but an obstacle to be overcome thanks for letting me bend your ear sincerely Annie love that name Annie was the name of my grandmother um I would say to you that don't overthink when I use the term Black Culture there are so many different subsets of culture that are working like I will sometimes speak on Mom culture and yeah it's what's uniting us the fact that we're all mothers and so we share this experience of raising our children and so when I lean in and say that I'm not saying that oh this means that you can't also say American culture of course you can that's actually a more uniting philosophy to say here is what we all have in common but within the group of American culturalism there's also going to be subsets of different variants of cultures that are united for different reasons so when I'm speaking on black culture I am talking about what is literally being reflected as a token of Blackness in the media right listening to hip-hop uh you know dressing a certain way speaking a certain way they are trying to say that this is your culture and because of the color of your skin you should be able to identify with that and that was what I was speaking to when I brought it up what has black culture even become people have experiences that bring them together and I think that's totally fine like I use the example of bomb culture black culture that I always aspire to which I say we should go backwards like the times of my grandfather when he was growing up and they were producing better music more about love and more about faith and more about family they were being united by the circumstances of their time at that time my grandfather grew up there was segregation in America and that's not to say that it's a good thing but I don't think that there's something wrong with finding your tribe within your tribe within your tribe within your tribe you know uh vegan culture I'm not saying that that means you can't partake in American culture but I am saying that you may want to join a Reddit group of people that are trying to figure out how much they can avoid eating things that are for your body sorry I'm probably losing some followers right now because I know vegans can be very very angry and when you say I Can't Believe It's Not Butter I want to know what it is and when you say plant-based meat what do you actually mean by that because plant might be the base of it but one is all the other crap that's in it anyways long story short the point is that people do tend to find their tribes and what that really is is just finding people that have various similarities with you so you follow me not because I'm a black black woman but likely because we share ideologies when it comes to politics all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about the Arizona Governor's race I don't want to it breaks my heart but I'm going to talk about it anyways so if you're not a member go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "eLlzuO_Vthc": "you have been censored on social media is that correct uh i have experienced a little bit of censorship uh you can't type my name in and find me my profiles on instagram or twitter which is really hard to find well i mean i don't understand how that could be possible you were a household name i'm sure you have a blue check mark i mean shouldn't you be a verified kyle written house in that regard but facebook and twitter uh they're kind of censoring kyle rittenhouse because they and they by the way took a very strong stance early on in the trial they were taking down any posts that were in support of you we've seen this gofundmes which is interesting before there is any sort of resolution they're taking down people's ability to raise money to support so this really shows you that the ecosystem is corrupt and they haven't gone back and attempted to correct anything like they they sort of slid it under the rug right right absolutely um i want to talk about judge schroeder because he kind of became a little bit of a celebrity um in and of himself raising with me i i mean is it do you how blessed were you to have him as a judge because he seemed genuinely just so angered by the trickery the lying the the regular attempts to hood wink the media being so implicit in it you know seeing people in the media that were even attempting to intimidate jurors throughout this trial yeah like um one media organization tried to film jurors but i believe judge schroeder was very fair and he was the judge i wanted for that trial because i knew he would give me a fair trial and let the evidence be presented as the evidence absolutely not let the jury be tated and what does it say that we have to hope for a fair judge in these cases that you know what does that really say about the system that we have to hope that a judge will just do their job right just actually examine the facts um and and you know allow things to happen the correct way in the courtroom and be con and conducted the right way because we haven't always seen that what does it say that we're in this space what is your opinion on our system our federal system the fbi i mean there was just so much corruption in this case it must have colored your opinion about really the nation well um that's a good question um i i look at things a little different now like i believe there needs to be people held accountable like prosecutors that overreach i believe they need to be held responsible and i believe there needs to be justice on the other side also not just justice was getting a not guilty verdict but it's not complete i think other people need to be held responsible for their actions also absolutely i couldn't agree with that more and i want to ask you because i saw that you had filed something attempting to get i didn't even know if they were still holding it but your ar 15 back they've held it for a very long time you're trying to get it back what is the reason that you want it back i want to make sure that the gun is destroyed and i want it destroyed that's why we filed that motion to have it destroyed wow interesting so what makes you want the gun to be destroyed it's become sort of symbolic in a way you know what i mean of like us finally winning on something on facts and reason winning on you know the second amendment what the second amendment means to this country um do you want to destroy it because it's represented this you know traumatic period of your life it was something that i used to defend myself and it was a very traumatic night and i don't think it's something that needs to be celebrated so i think the best place for it is to get destroyed wow how interesting wow so tell me how how does one move forward from this you know what is on the horizon for you other than being enrolled at asu you know what's new for you what are you hoping well i've started uh pilot classes so i'm working on becoming a pilot a private pilot i locked my first flight hours and i absolutely love it really and i've been snowboarding a lot and just been just been doing stuff that's fun and living my life yeah and you've had you've had an amazing response i mean with with evil also comes a lot of goodness you've been speaking and and making you know some appearances which people have been really celebrating you know nobody i guess wants to become a symbol of anything at a large scale especially at your age um but you know i hope that your takeaway is that god doesn't let anything happen by accident you know what i mean and you were meant to be in that place at the right time and a part of this insanity that is happening within our country but hopefully um these are clarifying moments in our country for a lot of people to really see sort of the mechanisms of corruption that i think need to be exposed and god has been with me from from the beginning my connection with god has grown way stronger i pray to him every day and he's helped me through so much and he's helped open the doors and guide me in the right direction and he's helped he helped the jury and guiding them in the right direction to make sure justice was done right i think that is a beautiful way to end the segment it's just a reminder that even the bad stuff that happens to people um there's always a greater design there's something the lesson that needs to be learned and it sometimes is really just god putting you

guys before we get in to the question of the day I do want to revert back to an episode that we had last week we discussed euthanasia if you will recall if you have not listened to that podcast you should go back it was last Thursday we specifically talked about the slippery slope of the government and euthanasia in Canada how it began as something that was only approved for people that were terminally ill and now today Canada seems to be killing the poor literally they're they're they're committing homicide in these hospitals there was a man that we discussed that spoke before Parliament and testified at the hospital essentially told him he had to kill himself because he couldn't afford to be alive and that is a very scary concept and something that will be coming down the pipeline in America of course their first they start with this magical pitch oh it's just going to be for people that are terminally ill and are suffering and it's a compassionate thing to do the next thing you know we have people that are perfectly healthy that want to commit suicide because of mental grief perhaps that they're going through because they might be going through a period of depression anyways you know that I very much look at the comments when we put things up because I like to know what you guys think and I think it's important for me to keep my pulse on the people around the world think about this topic so we can kind of gauge what direction this country is going to head toward I was very shocked by this particular comment that was under the YouTube segment I want to read it to you guys because I think it's important enough for me to respond to somebody commented on the euthanasia episode and they said I'm sorry Candace but I happen to know people who took their own lives no matter what therapy and doctors tried people with seemingly everything to live for they did so in the most horrific way you can imagine jumping off of a 10-story building jumping in front of a train and lately a friend filled a backpack with rocks and strapped it on and jumped into a lake when people are this mentally ill they will kill themselves and often in messy and horrible ways so who are you to judge and not give them a decent way out I don't understand how you would get there it's not understandable until you get sick like that so in this case I do not agree with your simplistic approach because it's not that simple that came from somebody using the handle on YouTube Coco 575. I am very horrified by this comment because it is it is that simple no government should have people in place that have the ability to assist people in killing themselves because they're going through mental grief but mental grief by the way that is not necessarily permanent because somebody is suicidal who knows for how long they're suicidal you are basically making the argument that the government then has the right to help them kill themselves that it's not that messy like that's the argument here it's like it's very messy to allow them and very horrific that they're jumping off a building so instead they should be able to take a pill and make it cleaner now we should be trying to help these people people go through periods of depression they can be long periods of depression if you even talk about about me I mean I would never say that I was suicidal but The Angst that I went through having left college and having over one hundred thousand dollars in student loans having Sally May call every 15 minutes literally and saying if you don't pay back these loans your life is going to be over essentially and going through that as a young person having to deal with that much anxiety what if I was seeing a therapist and just was saying like there's nothing to live for do you think that they should say well if you want to you should kill yourself what about in countries where they have high rates of suicide when people kill themselves like in in Japan right because they lose their job this is another reason that people can go through periods of depression a lot of times people feel mentally unwell because they can't get their lives together and there are all these other stressors how could you possibly think that giving the government the power to decide which people can go on and get better and which people can't is the correct way forward in a society here's an example just one example there was that CFO of Bed Bath and Beyond who recently jumped off of a building it's maybe he was involved in some financial fraud is what seems to be the indications from the headlines that Bed Bath and Beyond was going through some financial fraud potentially and he was involved so he jumped off the building he left his family behind in that scenario you think that when the walls are closing in we should have just allowed him to get a pill and kill himself because there was that's what he was going to do the manner would have been too ugly in terms of society how do you not see how slippery that slope is I often think about women after they have children and you see these headlines of women that do these dramatic things they call it postpartum depression and I have issues with that phrase because I don't even think it's depression I think it's what naturally happens to a woman when you're on very little sleep and you have babies that are that's just screaming throughout the entire night you're testing someone you're really testing someone mentally do you think those women when they come in they should just be given a pill to end their lives and they can't see a Way Forward like what is it for you that you think is somebody that deserves to die and how could you possibly think that we should be raising up doctors and nurses that just give people pills I will help you is that what you want I will help you commit suicide this comment especially bothered me because recently my high school my first boyfriend ever that I ever had in life committed suicide um it was something that we went through a few months back when I was nine months pregnant and it was it was horrific my entire community that I grew up with was bothered by this because he was such a wonderful person he was such a seemingly happy person no one knew that he was suffering in this regard he showed up every day to work he was running a business and by all indications the messages that I received him I kept her a friendship with him after all of these years he was doing great in life and then maybe he was going through a bad week we'll never know the answer to this question but he committed suicide in a horrible way the idea that you believe that someone should have helped him commit suicide because he was in that space and he was going to do it and it was just too messy that horrifies me no I I wish that we all had the opportunity in my hometown to be able to help him I wish that we knew that he was struggling and rather than going to a therapist or going to a government to assist him we all could have could have rallied around him and let him know how much he meant to all of us that's the right answer to this these people need help periods of grief don't last forever periods of depression don't need to last forever we don't need the state to step in and help people kill themselves I just I need to respond to that because I was just this comment made me sad it made me sad that we already have individuals that are justifying the idea of helping people commit suicide by the way there's such thing as assisted suicide it's homicide let's call it what it is I don't even like assist no it's homicide what is happening doctors are killing people intentionally that concept it really really disturbs me moving on I want to keep this conversation going about where the medical industry is headed the idea of helping people where it could possibly end how slippery is the slope I asked you earlier I asked what do you think about the IVF and the surrogacy programs that we have um and I asked you that question you're probably thinking so what big deal families uh need help there are people that struggle through infertility all things that I thought and I had to reconsider and start thinking more thoroughly about this topic when something happened in conservative land if you will amongst conservative commentators there was a bit of an issue when Dave Rubin if you're not familiar with him he has a political show on YouTube and David Janet that is his husband announced that they were having two children you might recall this they announced on Instagram they held him a picture of the two ultrasounds and said that they were going to have two boys and surprisingly this created a Trevor and people began commenting that this was ungodly this was wrong this was backwards a lot of commentators weighed in particularly I remember Ali Beth stuck at Beth Stuckey talking about how Sarah gets suffer and how this was anti-family that wasn't Ali Stuckey's words was other people that were in the comments saying that this concept of two gay men choosing to have a surrogate and to have a child was wrong and I was asked at that time to offer my commentary and I didn't because first and foremost I felt that we were using these two individuals as a conduit to a more important discussion like we were just sort of saying YouTube did this and now we're all going to yell about it and by the way the babies were already being born right they were already announced the pregnancy and there's something that felt wrong to me about attacking these two children like I mean I I love life I can't imagine these kids growing up and seeing that their birth announcement went so sideways and I was obviously especially sympathetic because at the time I was pregnant too and when I announced obviously people applauded and were so happy for me and I felt sad for Dave Rubin and David Janet that they did not have that same celebratory reaction from people and I thought we should not be we should have this discussion but we shouldn't be using Dave Rubin and David Janet's birth announcement announcement as a conduit now I'm ready to have this discussion because it did get me thinking about how little I knew about surrogacy and how little I knew about IVF so personally for me I know two couples that tried to have children seriously for almost a decade and just could not get pregnant I'm talking about heterosexual couples and all they wanted was to have one child and they turned to IVF the women held the children themselves and they gave birth to them now they had complications in each of those births which maybe is something that happens more often uh when you use IVF but the point being is that this their children were a tremendous gift to them right they resorted to IVF because they could not have children and I think that in my head I always sort of assumed that that was the reason that you have that the majority of people were doing their best and trying to have children and yet they were infertile for whatever reason so they turned to science and I thought in my head that this is a great scientific breakthrough to help people give birth but then uh some other couples the conversations that I was having about their reasons for turning to IVF or their reasons for turning to surrogacy I would say I don't want to say it was evil or but I would say that it was it struck me as odd the conversations that I was having so one woman was pregnant this was over in England and they had gotten pregnant naturally and they were having a boy and she said to me just so casually over dinner you know next time I will probably go to America and get IVF so I can make sure we have a girl and I went what why why would you first off why would you travel to America you're here in the UK and to have a girl what are you talking about and she said oh America has like the most open policies about IVF you can pick what gender the child is you're not about to do that here in the United Kingdom and I was like oh I didn't know this if you're listening to this you probably didn't know this either that in America you can obviously pick whether or not you're gonna have a boy or a girl they don't do that they find that to be immoral um in other places like the United Kingdom so you don't get to decide that so for her she was going to go do IVF because she wanted to ensure that she had one child from each sex how do you feel about that I'm asking you I'm not providing an answer because I don't really I don't have a conclusion to all of this it is an ongoing discussion that I think that we should have right another person was telling me about their IVF experience and they told me that they grade the embryos so after they put together the sperm and the Egg obviously it creates an embryo and the doctor will tell you well we recommend you implant this one because this one's an A and this one's going to be a b so this boy one that we created is maybe a bee and this girl one is an a which one do you want to implant and this one definitely could potentially have problems that's a c again I offer no commentary I just I think that's something that I didn't know and maybe you didn't know how do you feel about that how do you feel about that does that remove something from the process I I don't know how I feel about that right I once saw a couple and this is regarding surrogacy and they were looking for an egg donor and they were using a company that had created an app where they could look at women that were willing to donate the egg and they could look at their stats so to speak it was almost like looking like football stats so you could see almost like a Tinder app this egg donor goes to Harvard she has a 3.7 GPA she played volleyball in high school and then it was a picture pictures of the potential egg donor and I was watching this couple look at her and sort of oh her eyes are too wide oh too far apart oh her nose is too big yeah swipe like literally swipe let's look at the next one oh I really love that this one played volleyball that probably means that she's got an athletic egg that's good um yeah but I don't really like that she got you know she's 2.9 I don't like that she didn't go to university at all swipe swipe swipe how do you feel about that I do I can't explain I felt weird about it it something about it felt weird I can't really put it into words so I'm asking you how you feel about that over and over again we also see examples in the mainstream media of celebrities that are turning to IVF and turning to surrogacy not for those earlier reasons that I highlighted right there's not oh we're really just trying to have a child we've been trying for 10 years and this would be a gift from God I mean I literally know a couple that had to refinance their entire home for IVF I mean they were desperate for this child but in these more cultural examples in Hollywood you have people like Priyanka Chopra I think I'm saying her last name right Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas who openly said that they turned to IVF because they just couldn't get their schedules line they were too busy and when they realized her fertility schedule the days that she would be fertile and maybe days that he was shooting a music video or he was busy it just didn't line up so they turned to surrogacy they got somebody else pregnant because they couldn't make the time to come together as a couple during the days that she was fertile how do you feel about that how do you feel when it becomes sort of a luxury of wealthy people that don't have the time uh to come together like a normal couple and become pregnant how do you feel about that the same can be said obviously the Kardashians have been very vocal we know that Kim Kardashian even though she I think she had two kids yeah she had two kids and to be fair she had bad pregnancies it was very publicized that she had various issues with her first two pregnancies but the point I'm making here is that she had two children Kim and then they decided to use a surrogate for the other two that they wanted because they wanted four kids not two how do you feel about that I just want more children similarly her sister during the season two premiere of the Kardashians recently came out and announced that she was having another child a baby boy this time so maybe this is an example of she had first she had a daughter naturally she wanted a son and they decided to go the surrogate route with her ex presumably she wanted to make sure that both children had the same follow had the same father and she said this she said obviously it's just really private and I just don't want this to get out right now a tearful Chloe said and during a confessional because I want to protect my mental well-being as well as the surrogates and all of that it's just been a lot to go through all at the same time she's referring to the fact that right after uh they had implanted the embryo she found out that Tristan Thompson who is the father of her children was cheating on her uh you know so again this is a circumstance where we know that Khloe Kardashian is able to get pregnant but she wanted to use a surrogate because she was on shaky grounds in terms of her relationship with him but she wanted both of her kids to have the same father luxury how do you feel about that I I again I have no answers here but I do think that it's important that we discuss this here are a few other facts regarding surrogacy that I recently found out and I wanted to share with you the price in the United States for surrogacy ranges from one hundred and ten thousand dollars to one hundred and seventy thousand dollars for most families yes you can do things as I mentioned before like a refinance your home but the majority for the majority of people this is something that you do have to have some wealth to be able to afford there are no federal laws that govern surrogacy the states make their own rules because surrogacy is so expensive the United States many couples travel to India Thailand or Mexico where the process costs half or even less than half a 2017 study of 124 gestational surrogates found that newborns who were carried by gestational surrogates had higher rates of preterm birth and low birth weight than the surrogate's previous births of their own children that's something that Ali Stuckey had stressed is people rarely talk about the fact that the bodies of these surrogates are inclined to reject the pregnancy so they have higher rates of miscarriages to women that go through and carry somebody else's child so this is not IVF but surrogacy and they're more likely to go into preterm labor how do you feel about that you know these why are these women signing up to do this obviously because they are they're selling their bodies obviously because they need the money when I was looking at that app of the potential egg donors that I mentioned all of these women the majority of them were high school grads very young or people that were in University and just needed the money and they knew that if they went through this process of giving their eggs they could get ten thousand dollars per an egg something like ten thousand dollars per hour it's a lot of money for a person that needs it and is in University something that they're wanting to give up so they can have cash so whether we acknowledge it or not this is this is a transaction right this is a very serious transaction they are giving up their bodies for cash how do we feel about that I just wanted to have this discussion ultimately because I am learning I always tell you guys I am in process and I'm a work in proc in progress and I think that it's important that we are never flippant in our analyzes about topics like this I don't know how I would legislate this of course I can't say oh well you really if you had to make the law right well if you really really are trying to have a kid and really need it you should be able to have the child but if you're just using this as an active vanity you just want a girl or you know you are a rich celebrity and you don't have time to make to come together during your fertile days well no you shouldn't be able to do it of course you're not going to be able to legislate it that way so I want to hear from you guys and I will again as I always do check the comments and hopefully we will get closer to truth and that's all I have to say about that all right guys I want to take a moment to talk to you about good ranchers you all know I love this brand because they provide top quality American meat that is so much better than the stuff that you get at the grocery

celebrities who have had surrogates obviously we mentioned Kim and Khloe Kardashian and Priyanka and Nick Jonas but also Nicole Kidman Cristiano Ronaldo Andy Cohen of course Anderson Cooper of course Alec Baldwin Elton John Kristen wig Gabrielle Union and Dwayne Wade Sarah Jessica Parker and Jimmy Fallon just to name a few offering no commentary there other than has this become sort of a play thing of the rich more convenient thing for them to have I know some of these couples struggled with infertility I know Gabrielle Union among them um but it opens the conversation of the wealth that is behind the industry and I want to get into some topics that really underscore that point so the National Catholic register ran a headline entitled circuses incredibly dark side and they talked about what is happening in these third world countries that these Western couples are essentially taking advantages of the discounts uh when it comes to International surrogacy offers so they get a baby gestated for them at a low price and the women in third world countries get more money than they could ever make in several years obviously you would maybe say okay well that's the free market you're paying for what you want but it gets darker than that they essentially if these women get pregnant with multiples because they basically encourage the doctors to implant them with multiple embryos to ensure success so what happens of course if they get pregnant with two well what actually happens is that the extras are Petals on the black market so the couple thinks that they're getting this miracle at a bargain price and a lot of times they are not aware that their Miracle came with a second Miracle or maybe even a third miracle and then they just sold it to whoever was willing to pay and this article impacts one story regarding a really horrible horrible tale of a baby that's referred to as baby Dev it was a boy that was born of an Indian surrogate along with his twin sister the parents that commissioned it were a couple from Australia and when they came to pick up their children they decided that actually they could really only afford to raise one of them so they were aware that there were two children they they just looked at them and said I love the amazing beautiful but actually we only had the finances for one and they made the decision to take home just the girl to complete their family it's this is just unimaginable to me they already had a voice they thought the girl was the right decision to make and they left baby Dev behind the couple was also aware that because of Indian surrogacy law that Dev would be left stateless meaning that she would he pardon would not have citizenship and either India or in Australia so that seems really horrific it actually happened you can read more about that on the National Catholic register there was an Australian reporter Samantha Hawley who traveled to India to try to find baby Dev and she wasn't successful the relatives of the Australian couple insisted that Dev was adopted by some affluent family and that she would be fine but as I said there is no evidence of that in the Australian authorities believe that money money changed hands and that baby Dev was eventually just sold so that is what's happening and you're probably thinking why am I telling you this because it's important for us to know this like as I said earlier we can't be flippant when it comes to the stuff we're talking about children that are being abandoned and it doesn't just happen in Asian countries by the way the United States has plenty cases of surrogacy that have gone wrong for example do you remember Sherry Shepard she is that celebrity host of The View formerly and her now ex-husband Lamar Sally they hired a surrogate her name was Jessica Bartholomew they hired her to carry a child that they conceived with Sally's sperm and a donor egg now before that surrogate could give birth to the child which was supposed to be called Lamar Jr Shepard filed for divorce Sherry filed for divorced from her husband and she completely abandoned the boy both socially and financially Bartholomew was legally considered to be Lamar Junior's mother then because she was a surrogate and she was left to cover her own medical expenses and then was on the hook for child support so imagine your surrogate you get pregnant not only do you get pregnant you're carrying a celebrity's child and then the celebrity just changes their mind and says well actually me and my husband are breaking up and we're getting divorced so I no longer want the kid and by the way it wasn't my egg anyways yeah the surrogate was left holding the bag temporarily after a long legal battle it was Sherry Shepard that was officially placed on the child's birth certificate and she was ordered she had to have a court tell her to pay monthly child support I mean that is just so sad it's sad to think and to imagine that eventually Lamar Jr is going to be old enough to understand that his mother who really wanted him until she had a bad relationship with the father did all this like just wanted to abandon him another lesser-known case involved the surrogate named Crystal Kelly Kelly was offered ten thousand dollars okay imagine your surrogate could offer ten thousand dollars to abort the baby that she was carrying because they found out that the baby had some abnormalities but here is the kicker Kelly refused Kelly said no not for ten thousand dollars because obviously what happens when you're pregnant and you're a woman is the attachment is instant the idea this is why I am so Disturbed uh when these abortion activists come out and they say oh it's just it's just a clump of cells I mean from a second you hear about heartbeats at six weeks you you know that this is a life and you will instinctively fight to protect that life and Kelly in this circumstance fought to protect that life she refused the abortion so the commissioning couple hired an attorney who insisted that she was obligated to have that abortion and to terminate the pregnancy immediately she still objected she said I don't care what your attorneys say I don't care about this fear campaign I am not going to abort this child I feel this like growing inside of me that struggle by the way took place in Connecticut and as I told you these laws are state by state so in Connecticut surrogates have no parental rights and there's actually even a safe haven law that allows couples to hand their babies over to the state without fear of prosecution for child abandonment so Kelly what did she do well she up and she left that state the couple told Kelly that if she refused to abort the board upon the birth they would simply take custody and give the baby up as a ward of the state of Connecticut so at seven months pregnant Kelly moved to a state where she would be considered the legal mother the baby was then adopted by a couple that she met through support groups for families with children who have special needs and so that is completely a twisted story and I'm glad that that woman chose life it's sad that she had to fight to be able to choose life but these again are complicated issues when you're talking about surrogacy you are essentially saying to a couple that your body is nothing but a vessel and the baby inside of you is mine and if that couple is pro-choice which we shouldn't be calling it but Pro termination because they've decided that oh that's not a perfect baby I don't want it then yes surrogates then in some states are told you have to abort it immediately I ask the question again to my listeners how do you feel about that how do you feel about the story of Crystal Kelly having to fight to keep that life inside of her because the baby wasn't perfect enough how do we feel about the fact that these embryos are being graded and implanted and expected to be perfect and if they're not in some states they say you can just you can either have it and give it to the state and you'll be fine you just throw them into the system like in Connecticut ticket or no you need to have this abortion and you are going to be forced to have this abortion it's worth us having a conversation about it there was a documentary series that was done on Vice by a journalist named Giana tobani and she wanted to look into the surrogacy industry particularly in India where it is a multi-million dollar business and she never anticipated how dark this series was going to get essentially she was learning about what happens to the extra babies that are being born and so she went undercover and she spoke with agents and they were very flippant in telling her like yeah you can just get a baby on the black market do you want a white baby we can get you a white baby on the black market of course because they're implanting multiple embryos and then the embryos that are not wanted and women are giving birth they then sell them at a cheaper price and the sale of the x-rays in the black market was just one of many shocking things that she discovered you should definitely go pursue that and watch it and learn how this is taking place overseas because of once again it is always it seems to be always Americans that create the markets and then we sort of detach ourselves mentally from it we just oh it doesn't matter like we we want the baby so we don't want to hear about this you're probably even uncomfortable listening to this right why do I care about what happens in the third world country well it's like in an earlier episode when we talked about pornography and we talked about how the industry and the demand that is created in America the demand is happening here and so the supply happens overseas because there's less regulation overseas things are cheaper overseas people are poorer overseas they're more desperate overseas how do you feel about that moving on to a headline which actually inspired this episode it was a New York Post headline that ran last week it was entitled I'm pregnant with my own son's baby not what you think this is not a woman that had sex with her son but it is a woman that shows she's 56 years old to be the surrogate for her son I I was just I didn't know how to feel about this this is very strange to me it feels incestuous but it's not incestuous but it is kind of incestuous in a way and the Reason by the way she's very happy the family is excited to be welcoming another child you might think as I did when I jumped into this article that this woman her name is Nancy Hawk is the mother stepped up to the plate at 56 years old and said I will be your surrogates because I have watched you suffering and your inability to get pregnant and I want you to give you this gift of having one child you would think that that is what happened uh that is not how the story goes actually her son Jeff is 32 his wife Cambria is 30 and they have four kids already they have two sets of twins they just want another one and giving birth to their second set of twins her daughter-in-law had to have a life-saving hysterectomy which pretty much meant this is going to be your your last uh children last set of children but she had four she had they have four children so in instantly hearing that they weren't going to be able to have more on their own the mother the grandmother set up the plate and said well why don't we just get pregnant ASAP and I will hold the child like it was this is actually a direct quote from the mother who held the child I just suddenly had a feeling a few months after that after her daughter-in-law hysterectomy that I should offer to do it I told my son and he teared up and I was shocked I hadn't even told my husband at that point but he was really supportive so yeah they just decided to get their mother-in-law or in this case Jeff's mother pregnant so that they could have a fifth child immediately after they had their third and fourth child this is not a family that was struggling to have children again Guys these are topics that are hard to hear they're hard even harder to think about it's hard to come out of it and say in a straight line what you think about something but it's a challenge to do so and I'm constantly trying to challenge myself to think about these topics that make us uncomfortable in the hope that we can come to some reasonable conclusion so I leave it to you to consider it and that's all I have to say about that all right guys for the next portion of the show it is only going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus as usual I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on converting to Catholicism and I'm revealing a crazy video of covid concentration camps in China so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] foreign [Music]", "MRdZ5wZdw3I": "you know one person that i wish was president united states i hate to say this but clay aiken just kidding is running for congress though and we need to talk about this it's kind of incredible this ad for congress is amazing i want you to pay particular attention to how he tries to smear madison cothbourne because madison cloth horns actually says nothing wrong in the clip that he presents of him but here we are let's watch clay aiken for congress hey folks it's been a while now i know i look a little different these days but we've met before i'm clay aiken most you probably remember me like this skinny back in those days i was a bright-eyed kid from north carolina on my way to becoming a special ed teacher and then that little singing competition changed everything for me for decades north carolina was actually the progressive beacon in the south we had the best roads and the best schools because back then the loudest voices in our government were progressives who actually made sure our state was always moving forward but then things changed and the progressives lost power and we started getting backwards ass policies like the voter suppression bills and the bigoted bathroom bill because today it seems like the loudest voices in north carolina politics are white nationalists like this guy my friends i encourage you continue to make your voice heard because do we love donald trump and hateful homophobes like this one what is the purpose of homosexuality what does it create and now we all know it's not just a north carolina thing for every madison and mark in north carolina there's a margaery in georgia or lauren in colorado and these folks are taking up all the oxygen in the room and i'm going to tell you i am sick of it and i'll tell you something else as democrats we have got to get better about speaking up and using our voices because those folks ain't quieting down anytime soon that's why i'm running for congress and just think how excited these guys are going to be when we elect the south's first gay congressman i just want to say i watched his season american idol he's suddenly gayer than he's ever been like he's pretty like i was like is kellyakin gayer for some reason then i realized that at the end when he dropped the flags that he's running on being gay like you always know like this is the new thing and i'm like he just wasn't i not that i have any issues with him being gay but like he just didn't present this early immediately like over the top when he was on american idol and i'm like okay this is gonna be his brand he's gonna drop down the lgbt flags this is how he intends to win michael you know clay personally he is obviously saying that he's a really nice guy and um he's never done anything wrong and he's kind he wants to listen to his potential constituents and i just want to show a clip of him moderating your debate with someone who couldn't get as the moderator he's the moderator here i'm asking the questions so hold on a second um hold on a second yeah i'm asking the questions feel free to try to control it but you won't get through i'm not one of them i'm asking you what can be done about climate change i'm pretty ignorant about the whole argument myself i'll admit i'm asking you what should we do unless you unless you want to see the ground to democrats to be the ones who come up with ideas are people who are marching and shouting jews will not replace us are they good people just a yes or no question yes or no no it's a yes or no question are people who are marching shouting jews will not replace nazis can you say yes or no to this are you capable of that i don't need to answer a question because i'm not on the stage no i did not ask you if nazis were back and i understand that those are like real people who are nazis are okay that's not what i asked you i've answered this five times [Applause] i asked a yes or no question does president trump lie yes or no before before you before you start since since clearly the audience thinks i'm biased we're going to let them ask some questions well i may be a hack but i've got  microphones [Laughter] okay clay aiken this guy clay aiken did you ever read the

be where the nice guy is in politics because you know he he presents himself and he says look y'all i'm just i was on that fun singing show 25 years ago and i you know y'all i just want to bring us all together he smears a totally mainstream frankly kind of moderate republican as a nazi he smears some other guy well i guess all of us as bigots because we don't think dudes should walk into the women's bathroom and then he does you notice he doesn't get bathroom policies the bigoted bathroom bills he doesn't fly the american flag in the ad he flies one flag it is the radical leftist lgbt lmnop flag the only reason there's an american flag in the video at all is because madison catherine is wearing an american flag and he's trying to smear him when he says uh you're that horrible thing madison author and said he said uh make sure your voices are heard that was horrible it's a radical campaign a radical campaign madison hawthorne is running my takeaway here was this is a complete and utter indictment of our pop culture and american idol that they create clay aikens and not michael knowles that's that was my thing when i watch it you have a great southern accent i thank you he should run for office how about that maybe i'll run in north carolina all right he was by the way less gay in that debate with you i mean i don't know like he's just like transforming his character like he wanted to give you the heads up like he was going to beat you he's like he was what's up audience what's up who wants some you know what i mean not that sweet guy who's like you know i'm gonna fly the lgbt but this is why you've gotta watch out for the nice the nice guys because these these nice guy politics of inclusion and equity and diversity are saying that if you are to the right of hillary clinton you're a nazi you and madison cawthron you're all nazi terrorists and if you think that dudes are not chicks you're a hideous bigot who should be ostracized from society that's what he's running on right yeah i actually want to thank you michael for exposing this because it was really on its face how biased he was the entire crowd was booing however what you demonstrated there was what every single republican has to face when they do a presidential debate when they go on to corporate media when they try and do a press hit but especially during presidential debates you have these non-bias moderators who are third debaters and fourth debaters and who will stop short and will cut off and will argue with a conservative or a republican and it's why i am 100 in favor of the idea of getting rid of that trash entirely we're all human beings we're not robots like sotomayor says that we are we're all toasters right we should have a democrat and a conservative on the presidential debate stage and they should ask questions on behalf of you the conservative candace owens should be a presidential debate moderator are you in agreement with us this would be incredible to have her on the debate wouldn't she want to hear joe biden or kamala harris debated by candace owens danny there's one problem there's one problem which is you can't be a moderator and a candidate at the same time so i don't know very true oh god i would have fun just being in the debates like i mean i would just say i'm going to ban you're not allowed to say bigoted homophobe nazi white supremacist and they'd have not they would just say quiet the whole time yeah they would just be completely new because that's all they have i mean it's become a joke it's all they do is sit here and try to smear in real time republicans because they know that they can't win these debates based on policies so they're just going to say oh that guy's bad that guy's racist and it is pretty disgusting

you accidentally created an avatar of yourself now you might be thinking Candace what are you talking about did I create an avatar of myself what I mean more specifically is is there a you that you have created that lives in the online universe that has nothing to do with you in your real life like are you an entirely different person in your real life you've somehow separated your online activities and who you are online means nothing in terms of the things that you are doing in person as just one example we spoke about this because I think about this all the time when I examine the way that women act in their behavior online I go how why are they doing this would they do this if we were actually face to face as one example a couple of episodes ago on this podcast cast we discussed Emily rajakowski and I was remarking how odd it was that she is speaking about her husband who she is now divorcing and how he cheated on her and in the media it said sources say that he's an absolute dog those sources might be Emily herself who knows but the idea that her husband is a dog because he cheated on her and I guess the real world but Emily posts naked photos of herself on Instagram all the time for men and women that she doesn't know to look like I posed a question like would she do that in the real world would Emma rojakowski go into a room full of guys and take her top off and if she did that would she consider that cheating I think her answer would be yes I don't know I hope it would be us but somehow if she does it on Instagram she's like this is fine this is just what I do if she's created that means an avatar of herself so her husband has sinned because he didn't do it online he did it in real life but she doesn't sin by extent relatively putting naked photos and nudity online for everyone to take a look at so this discussion and why it is also on my mind is because it came up again on a backstage porn discussion backstage obviously daily wire we do it live once a month where all of the hosts sit around and we talk about various topics and then behind the paywall even further on daily wire plus the conversation continues well let me tell you I think the most interesting discussion that has ever been had on daily wire backstage took place on daily wire plus you should go pursue it and you should go find it it was us discussing porn yeah so picture me Candace by myself as the only woman in a room full of guys chiefing cigars talking about pornography and the reason this topic came up is because we obviously take audience questions from our live viewers and somebody wrote in and asked about her husband she said I have I'm paraphrasing here but she said I'm in a relationship my husband is addicted to porn do you have have some resources that you guys might recommend and so we went around and at first we just kind of tried to answer the question I spoke about the Bible as a resource Michael spoke about the Catholic faith but then the conversation evolved or devolved whichever way you want to look about it when you want to think about it and to expanding on whether or not watching porn was an act of infidelity and Ben Shapiro took the stance that there were different scales of sin right so watching perhaps pornography online on your laptop is of course not the same as engaging in having sexual a sexual Affair in the real world right and I didn't necessarily agree with that and neither did Matt Walsh and Matt Walsh offered this take a listen we talked about how there's really no difference between doing something on the Internet doing it in real life well if you found out that your husband went to a motel room and was the third party uh in some sort of sexual dalliance he but he didn't do anything he just could have kind of sat there in the hotel room watching it then I think we would all agree in this room that that is cheating that is serious that's like that could destroy your marriage and I would still say you shouldn't emasculate your husband it depends what you mean by a masculine like to have the discussion about I mean you may not have a discussion no no but I actually have the discussion that me and my husband has because I'm reading a lot of books about Catholicism because I want to understand his commitment to Catholicism right so we didn't have discussion because he was watching porn or anything like that what I'm saying is that she said that her husband has an addiction and I are you saying that it's emasculating to even have like what are you viewing as a masculine I guess is my question yeah I'm saying don't emasculate your husband I'm saying a lot of the ways that one can react to that problem yeah are emasculating and I'm saying that I do think you're a perverty pornography he emasculates himself the pornography you a masculine and I'm clear on both sides of this I accuse women of doing inactive infidelity when you're on the internet putting your boobs and and giving them pornography on Instagram that's why I brought up Emma rajkowski and what Emily rodrickowski and what she's been doing to her husband you've got a lot of women are addicted to wearing yoga pants and I don't think I don't think that one should humiliate their wife okay so what do you think about that so me and Matt Walsh are taking the stance and he asks a very important question I think if you are saying that it's totally fine for a woman or a man to lock themselves into a room and watch pornography and it's not an act of infidelity would you also then agree that if a wife or a husband went into a hotel room and watched two other people having sex that would also not register as an active infidelity you probably in a lot of words they don't know that's definitely that's different because it's in the real world okay so then how do you how do you differentiate you're watching two people on screen that is it's not your spouse right that are having sex for some reason we have all accepted that the online world you can just sort of create a different Avatar of yourself well I I I'm not actually in the hotel room with them as they're doing this I'm watching it via a screen but think about where that lands us think about the world that we're in think about what technology has allowed for decades ago of course this didn't exist and you wouldn't ever ever ever think that it would be acceptable for an individual to be watching other people partake in sexual activities now things are getting very extreme as just one example virtual reality glasses right you know what I'm talking about these VR glasses that people are wearing I put them on one time and it terrified me it was so real it terrified me right I was unwilling to as I had these glasses on my face to begin the video game all I had to do was to jump right so my physical body in the real world just had to jump but the virtual glasses were spelling to me that this was so real that if I jumped I would be falling down a building falling down 50 stories onto the ground and I refused to jump that is how real the VR glasses make things right people are now watching pornography that way would you consider that to be an active infidelity would you consider forget if it's just on your computer screen but what if you're now able to put yourself in such a realistic scenario that you're surrounded by naked women or naked men and you are then able to watch pornography that way does that seem like an active infidelity these are very important questions you might say yes you might say no I would say yes I would say yes and I think as that conversation goes on it is good to have an expectation that your spouse will not partake in those things I think that's fair but we keep lowering the bar on expectations because we are creating some weird mental separation between our online behavior and our real life Behavior someone also offered to me and I don't have an answer to this it's just more food for thought I'm just giving you food for thought what about video games they asked me what would you say about video games what if you go online and you're shooting a bunch of people online obviously that is not the real world is any different now I don't mean to uh stoke the Flames of a debate about whether video games are causing mass shootings I do not believe that at all when it begs the question is that a good thing to engage in for your mentality and for your psyche I'm asking you that question I I can't answer that because the last thing I played was Mario Kart and I like to think that me I am a person that virtual Candace is exactly the same as non-virtual candidates I have not created an avatar of myself I I would never think that it would be acceptable for me to go online and to pose nude and then in the real world be like oh I don't know why guys are lusting after me I have no idea that's online candidates that's Avatar Candace anything I put online you would see in my real life meaning I post if I post a picture of me and my husband sitting at a restaurant you could find me and my husband sitting at a restaurant I'm not creating a different character of myself just um an interesting update regarding Emma rodrigowski she came out in defense of the woman if you're following the story of Adam Levine having cheated on his Victoria Secret model wife bahati Prinsloo a lot of people including myself talked about that woman who he was texting because she wanted to absolve herself from his Instagram DMS and said she felt manipulated and yes she had engaged in this one-year dalliance with Adam Levine but she was just a young girl and we all rightfully said that excuse no longer cuts it you knew he was a married man that doesn't excuse him oh it doesn't excuse him of course he partooking this and he is the one that took the vows to Bahari Prinsloo but we need to stop excusing the women of course Emily rojakowski whose husband has recently cheated on her and she does not at all think she has played a role in this she does not see her acts on Instagram to be an active infidelity had something to say about that take and of course she is going to defend the woman in involved in this affair in this take a listen in our culture right now is that we just say oh men are monsters they're terrible they're horrible we don't hold them accountable and then we blame other women we ask women to adjust their behavior instead of just saying men need to change their behavior it's sexism it's classic misogyny period it's actually none of those things Emily but I don't expect you to know what any of those words mean um actually it's not classic misogyny to expect that women act respectable towards other women that are in married relationships it's not classic sexism to say that it takes two to tango that's that's actually equality if you want to get down to it to look at the party that has involved both parties the man and the woman and say both of you hold responsibility here that's equality I know that women are getting so used to special benefits in the post metoo and times up world that equality feels like discrimination but it isn't we're not discriminating against this woman she knew what she was doing she knew who Adam Levine was right she knew exactly what she was doing when she answered his direct messages she knew he was a married man just like he knew he was a married man they are both wrong and the the sweet irony of her we need to just blame the men it's no if you actually Lee had an equitable brain Emma rajkowski you would see how your own behavior in your marriage was an act of infidelity as I said in previous episode I feel like I have slept with Emma rajkowski every time I open an article about her her boobs are in my face every time you open Instagram and they suggest posts to you her boobs are in your face and you don't even know why by the way the most bizarre headline of this week was actually uh I think it was in The Daily Mail they were reporting and they said it said Emily rajakowski promotes bikini topless what I don't even understand that what do you mean she's she's selling a bikini topless how are you don't you physically have to wear the Garment somehow she's just like I'm taking my boobs are out again so buy the bikini that's not on me I mean this is this is weird and as I said represents a tremendous Act of infidelity to her marriage and so she got what she gave and she was given exactly what her behavior is someone who is not in a committed relationship another person who I loved to consider uh when talking about this topic of these strange avatars that we have created is Madonna who has become so strange uh it's almost like we are watching somebody facing a real mental crisis which is what Instagram really has become various women acting out their mental crises here are some photos of her she's wearing fishnet tights you post this to her personal Instagram she has her boob out she is in leather and she is biting what looks to be a leather oh the end of her end of her metal bed and she's wearing just to be extra controversial she's wearing a cross around her neck and yeah fishnets and heels half naked actually more than half naked and this is meant to be seductive and she has her buttocks out through the fishnets and she's bending over on top of a pillow and I look at this and I say would you do this she's under the bed in this one photo she's under the bed with her butt in the air and fishnets she's 63 years old I believe now look at these photos and I ask myself would you do this in real life Madonna I mean just imagine if you're a person and you're going to buy a mattress right you're just going through a store you're like I need a better mattress and you see a 63 year old woman right and she's in fishnets and she's on top of a bed and she's moving her hips and she's gyrating into sexy poses getting on top of this mattress then she gets under it and she's fully oh she's almost naked right and she puts her butt into the air and you can see her thong through it and then you see that she's wearing a leather corset with her boobs pushed out you would say this is completely crazy somebody please call a police officer to assist this woman she's obviously having a breakdown you would expect and not be surprised if she got taken away in an ambulance and put on a psych 5150 hole because clearly she's having some sort of a breakdown right yeah in the real world but not in the strange Avatar world that we've created where 63 year old women doing this is normal is okay is in some cases according to the comments Brave slay Bay oh we love you it's provocative yeah it is provocative it's provoking me to think that you have a mental disorder and it needs to be addressed and that's all I have to say about that okay guys before we get into some of these crazy headlines today I want to talk to you about front page Magazine front page magazine was founded by conservative writer David Horowitz and has spent over two decades combating the radical left's efforts to destroy America there are two new podcasts the right tape with Mark tapson and the Jason Hill show offer riveting interviews and insightful coverage of politics culture and current events it takes a village to combat the radical left's effort to destroy America that's why as a fan of my show you should also check out these guys over at front page magazine by visiting frontpagemag.com while you're there you can support their cause by making a tax-deductible donation inside every Progressive is a totalitarian screaming to get out and no one understands that better than the team at front page magazine go check out frontpagemag.com today okay now it's time for some topics [Music] all right so if you're like me and you're extra conscious when you are on social media you're starting to realize that people are presenting with mental disorders let's see the only way to describe it in fact I have noticed some influencers that have huge followings doing this new thing where they cry um for attention they cry they quite literally have something on their life and they will post these videos of them crying and they say things like usually what they have in the caption is this is the real me raw and they're crying hysterically and maybe sometimes there's some music to it and I remember there was one person I used to follow that did this and I just thought in my head this person is deranged obviously because that is not normal behavior if you consider the steps to get to the point where you're crying online right so what happens is you have a feeling you're sad sad sad and rather than doing something normal like I don't know just crying by yourself or reaching out to a friend or calling a family member people that you know and that are there to come for you you grab your phone you quickly grab your phone and you get onto a social media and you press play so I don't know if you're holding back the tears or you're starting the tears but think about that process of your first instinct when you have a real emotion is to do something as inauthentic as grabbing your phone opening a social media app and pressing play that I mean it's just what clearly this is a weird thing but as I said earlier people are creating avatars of themselves and it's all about just getting those likes so it is no surprise that there is an article entitled addicted to being sad teenage girls with invisible illnesses known as spoonies posts tick tocks of themselves crying or in the hospital to generate thousands of likes as experts raise concerns over internet-induced waves of mass anxiety I think we're just going to jump right into me showing you and having you listen to some of these tick tocks I will read what is on the screen and describe what I am seeing so this is a girl who is sitting on a toilet and she is crying and she is holding a medical device she has some sort of in autoimmune disorder not relevant to me describing this to you but she's going to inject herself with her medicine on this toilet as she cries to music this is what she's doing on Tick Tock I don't even I I can't even offer any commentary on that here is another video of a second person who is going to get some likes she is laying down on a mattress fully her face facing the camera of course and it says this is America so I get to be in severe pain every day I was released from the hospital and they wouldn't bump up the surgery because it's not considered an emergency so this is my only option the option being to take Tylenol and she's crying on the bed allegedly in pain here's a third video in which she writes as she again dancing to music is holding her belly it says point of view tell me you have chronic pain without telling me you have chronic pain she's gyrating she's crying she's facing the side and she's grabbing her back and she's grabbing her stomach and she is crying I do not doubt that she has chronic pain I think that social media is causing people to have chronic emptiness which to me represents a sort of crying pain I am shocked at the anti-socialness of social media right to What It Takes the time that it takes and sucks away from your real life to set up a camera to set up a tripod and to rock back and forth to come up with language to put on the screen to get people to feel bad for you uh to take the time to drum up enough emotion to create tears all of that action taking place has got to take up minimally the videos that we just saw you know an hour maybe right for them to get that going for them to post it all so after you post it you sit there and you psychotically wait for the likes and the comments and for someone to give you faux Applause and say you're so brave that's that's a mental disorder that is happening this these these young women are not healthy they don't know how to go out and to get that attention from elsewhere so these are empty vessels and it is again a deep irony that we are calling this social media when in fact it is creating anti-social behavior that is what I'm always seeing it goes back to a couple days ago when we covered Chrissy Teigen and this never-ending uh miscarriage turned into an abortion story that she was in the hospital and she every second that she was in the hospital was telling people we're doing great we're in the hospital blah blah blah I mean she just wanted everyone to be in that hospital room with her strangers by the way this is this is this is what makes it even more bizarre is that we're doing this to appeal to people that simply do not know you right there they can't do more but hit the like button maybe that gives you a temporary high and a kick of Serotonin a dopamine shot to your brain or post a comment like oh I'm so sorry you're going through this all praying for you oh I I you know I'm hoping that you're doing okay thinking about you that is why they are doing this these this very extreme Behavior All For What ultimately will result in a like potentially some more follows and some positive commentary of people feeling bad for them totally bizarre incredibly the New York Post covered this phenomenon and I am encouraging you guys to find this article and to read it in its entirety because I am going to Grace through it but it is worthy of sitting down and reading the entire thing it was written by Dr Nicholas cardaris and the article is entitled how social media is literally making teens mentally ill in it they first unpack a patient's treatment they gave this patient the name Susie obviously not her real name but it was someone that he saw who was showing symptoms of borderline personality disorder and he figured out that she was spending up to 12 to 15 hours a day on Instagram Tick Tock and YouTube after she became depressed because a bunch of her friends went off to University so yeah it could be a sadness everyone's in college or not you're back at home I get it but now this girl starts spending 15 hours a day across various social media platforms this led to her to following a bunch of borderline personality disorder influencers because why wouldn't there be a community of borderline personality disorder influencers right there's an influencer for everything and she started joining online BPD groups that's obviously stands for borderline personality disorder and slowly she began to emulate their behavior so she didn't have a borderline personality disorder but she starts emulating their behavior because obviously she's trying to identify with this tribe and so what that led to was she began cutting herself because she watched these videos of influencers that said that cutting themselves helped them feel like they were in control by the way quick pause isn't it amazing what doesn't get banned on social media but what does get banned I'm just I'm amazed like if you say I don't think the vaccine worked goodness take it offline take it it's a danger but these BPD girls talking about their cutting and influencing people to cut themselves and saying that cutting just helps them feel in control for likes this can stay on the internet I guess because it maybe is a good thing for big Pharma and more patience I suppose so back to Susie's story so she starts cutting herself but admits to the doctor that is seeing her that she doesn't actually like to cut herself it doesn't actually offer her any sort of a release as these girls are talking about online she's just doing it with the hope that eventually it will give her relief and the reason why she liked that angle is because she felt that them talking about their cutting made them extra interesting and authentic what does that sound crazy because it is crazy but that is what people are seeing they're like the more extreme that you are on your behavior the idea is that you're trying to perceive people they're trying to get people to perceive that you are more authentic and more real so we go back to that example of women crying on the internet right I'm so real and I'm so raw right and these girls are following me and eating it up and they're going I'm going to emulate that and I'm going to now put every feeling I have and every feeling that I have on the internet these so that people I don't know feel closer to me or maybe perhaps that I feel closer to them but you never actually do feel closer to them right it just leads to depression so this doctor helped Susie out in the most amazing way do you want to know what he prescribed her borderline personality disorder he prescribed her no internet what an idea once all of her devices and social media were removed something quite amazing happened within two weeks she was calmer and less reactive she made friends in the program that she was in and she no longer cut her arms and all thoughts of suicide evaporated he turned off her phone so to speak stop being online and stop being a crazy person stop following these influencers that are influencing you to be irrational and unstable they are you are just becoming an emotional bubble because you're watching all these people that are competing to do more and more extreme things for a couple of likes but the doctor says what's interesting is that if she actually had BPD she shouldn't have been cured that quickly right because she didn't really have it what she had was something closer to a social Contagion I'm going to read you directly from this article this is a quote we are living in the age of digital social contagions it's a time where certain illnesses aren't spread by biological transmission but by a digital infection that attacks the psychological immune system using algorithms that find and exploit our psychological vulnerabilities we get sicker as a big attack gets stronger a psychological immune system I love even that phrase because that is what it is it is a social contagion and it is breaking people down psychologically and you have to develop a psychological immune system I think that is something we don't talk about enough making sure that you are fortified mentally enough to deal with the insanity that you see another quote from the article the 1999 Columbine school shooting was the first in the digital age such events had been almost unheard of before then since then they have become a horrible part of daily life however even the FBI acknowledges that these are internet-fueled copycat events classic example of a social contagion spread and spawned on social media and hate-filled chat rooms that incite the unstable think about that a shooting happened they keep wanting to blame the gun nobody ever wants to talk about the clinical picture of the individuals that are shooting these guns no one ever want to talk to much to discuss these social contagion Factor no one ever wants to discuss the fact that they are quite literally doing this for attention so no they're not crying they're not cutting themselves they've gone so extreme for attention that they're willing to kill people so that their names are known social media is never ever ever blamed or discussed when we talk about these things though because you know what they're they're too big and they're too powerful big Tech is too powerful for them to ever get into trouble so it becomes incumbent upon us to continue to have these discussions here's another quote from the article that's impactful like BPD gender dysphoria is a real psychological phenomenon that people genuinely struggle with however what we're seeing now is something different we're seeing social media shaping people in ways that seem to mimic some of these disorders yet are not the genuine disorders several colleagues and I have begun to call them cases of pseudo-bpd pseudo did or pseudo-gender dysphoria these are cases where they're presenting symptoms dissipate when the person is removed from social media for several weeks thereby proving that the behaviors presented are not the genuine disorder boom boom there's just no way you look around I keep saying there's just no way there are this many kids that are struggling with identity I didn't graduate with a single trans child a trans you know adult transgender none in my classes ever suddenly you fast forward a few years I graduated high school in 2007. you've fast forward a few years and now everyone in four whatever it is is has some sort of an identity thing no they are learning this Behavior they're either learning it from adults that are obsessed on social media which is why so many of these moms and teachers are on Tick Tock talking about identity I'm a tick tock teacher I'm a tick tock teacher and I want to make sure my students know this they are presenting or they're presenting a psychological disorder and they are impressing that upon their own children whether that is in the classroom their students or whether that is at home on their own children because it is a way in a manner for them to get attention what we are talking about is people that are empty on the inside their phone becomes their entire life their social media Pages become their entire life their entire days in the real world revolve around the artificial World it revolves around this Avatar they have created and they will lean into that Avatar as much as possible for one like that's all I have to say about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Johnny Depp's new relationship and Stacy Abrams recent commentary on abortion so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you [Music]", "sMB6JQcYwYs": "did you know that it is being reported that in canada one of the leading causes of death is euthanasia yeah that shouldn't really surprise you today we're going to talk about that and i'm also going to offer an apology for something that i said last week what could it be is it for calling kim kardashian a prostitute nope probably not plus chrissy teigen previously told us that she had a miscarriage but now she says it was actually a life saving abortion all that and more coming up on candace owens [Music] so it's being reported that in canada one of the leading causes of death is euthanasia now that might be surprising you it definitely doesn't surprise me because i'm married to a man that has impressed upon me the left is actually in a death cult unsurprisingly it's killing people so we had talked about by the way in case you're thinking oh euthanasia of people that are extremely sick and are in a lot of pain and therefore want to be able to kill themselves yeah that's the pitch that was the initial pitch they said oh we need to have these laws passed so that people who are very sick don't have to suffer and be in pain the pitch is always a compassionate one right we don't want people to be in pain and therefore we need to pass through this legislation but we covered a while ago how two sisters got on a plane they were perfectly healthy they were not dying and they went to switzerland and they killed themselves because they just wanted to die and i kept impressing upon people and my listeners to pay attention to this because they are having this debate about euthanasia it's waging all across europe and it's obviously something that switzerland has really grabbed and said yes people have a right to die irrespective of what they're going through they sit down with people they talk to them and when they agree that they want to die they have doctors that help them accomplish that they have psychologists that help them accomplish that so in canada this is already the sixth leading cause of death and you're going to start hearing euthanasia become a more uh pertinent political debate here in the united states now when i first met my husband and while we were uh waiting to get married leading up obviously we got engaged after two weeks so in the first year i should save our relationship he kept saying that phrase the left is a death cult the left is a death cult i never not that i didn't take him seriously but i never inquired further i thought he was being theatrical when he said that just sort of being hyperbolic there are death cult there are death cults but then we started to have deeper conversations about exactly what he meant and he is could not be he could not be more right and i'm going to explain to you what he's talking about think about every single position that the left takes right what does it lead to and what is it about what is it exactly that they're celebrating first and foremost we talked about this last week climate change you have a bunch of children that believe that they are going to die in 10 years unless right if you want to stay alive you're going to have to do this actually it would be irresponsible for you to have children because uh you know the climate and the environment and things are bad in the world so you need to agree not to go on and have families because the world is going to end and it's bad for the climate for you to have more children carbon emissions something along those lines that's always the pitch so you have a bunch of people that are in this cult because they think that they're going to die but forget that let's move on to another area of interest for the left abortion right how radical that we are having politicians we're going to have an example of that later on in the show but politicians that are getting onto a stage attempting to justify again always using this element of compassion it's compassionate to allow women to have abortions up to nine months in the womb right it's compassionate you don't understand what they're going through to want to bring them to this moment they must be under so much duress and so much stress and it must be a medical emergency in order to be compassionate we have to welcome this death right never mind the fact that the black population as just one example would be double today if we stopped being compassionate as they call it in allowing people to murder their offspring in the womb never mind the fact that the history of abortion has nothing to do with compassion no it had murderous tendencies it had to do with the fact that margaret sanger believed in eugenicism it had to do with the fact that people believed at that time in america during the progressive era the greatest thinkers of our time these were yale and harvard graduates in fact it was a columbia graduate actually the man that was behind starting the bronx zoo ironically who wrote a book his name was madison grant it was called the passing of the great race this was the most red book at the time in the progressive era and it was this thesis that they had to protect the nordic supreme race white people from from the nordic hemisphere that they had to protect them by making sure that other people were not breeding with them this is what they believed and so they thought up abortion and they said okay well if we start aborting their offspring then we will protect our precious race we breed individuals that are smarter that are more capable and we don't want our great race to pass this was the thinking behind the abortion world people are going to try to tell you something different planned parenthood was started by an avowed eugenicist and in fact that book the passing of the great race was something that hitler adolf hitler referred to as his bible but today they've sold you something else today planned parenthood is about compassion so please don't pay attention to the millions and millions and millions of infants that are being sacrificed right for this compassionate push then you have another topic and area of interest for the left the trans agenda you would be just it's unimaginable that it is considered an act of aggression to say that children should not be taking puberty blockers right somehow we we are on the the bad side the crazy side for suggesting that we should allow children to grow up before they make decisions about whether or not they want to mutilate their bodies because that's what it is of course a man cannot become a woman a woman cannot become a man you can mutilate your bodies and you can have you can have cosmetic procedures that will make you feel like when you look in the mirror that you look like a man or that you look like a woman but you're never going to be a woman just because uh you block puberty you're never going to be a man just because you blocked your puberty in fact we know what the result is if you watched my colleagues what is a woman the result is that these people matt walsh's what is woman i'm talking about obviously the result is that these individuals grow up and they have sexual dysfunctions right they're taking drugs like lupron which is stopping them from having puberty but it's also a drug that is used when we medically castrate pedophiles right when we medically castrate sex offenders they're now encouraging children to take this drug because there is this overarching idea this overarching position that somehow it's going to render these people happier and freer and it never does that of course but this is a death cult right so these children will go on and they will have medical issues for the rest of their lives and i bet we don't know because we're at the beginning of this that their lives will be shortened but hey it's compassionate right the pitch is always what could you imagine if your child cares what would you do if your child came up to you and they cried and they said oh i want to commit suicide because i just feel like i'm in the wrong body please please please well the answer to that question is i would ask them where the hell they even heard that concept from this is not something that i even heard when i was a child the idea that you could pick your gender this wasn't even a thing right so this is poison this is the agenda of death and they are now focused on our children i think that's enough no of course because death and destruction is everywhere the left just loves ways to train people to want to harm themselves which brings us to the body positivity movement that sounds nice who doesn't want to feel positive about their body oh we're talking of course about clinically obese people and we now have a bunch of women and a bunch of men that are going online using the hashtag bodypositivity and showing you clinical clinical obesity that's what they're showing you we had cosmopolitan that actually ran on the cover of their magazine fat is healthy and they had a bunch of clinically obese women that were in yoga positions and wearing yoga pants and smiling because they are trying to convince people that fat is healthy that is obviously a lie it is a deception it is a lie that is going to harm people and for whatever reason the fact checkers are never they never exist on the internet when this is going on right when somebody is trying to tell you that fat is healthy and that fat is a good thing the fact checkers are completely silent i don't know what they're doing they're busy they're always busy that day which brings me to lizzo lizzo recently won an emmy for her amazon series entitled lizzo's watch out for the big girls she gave an acceptance a speech which i'm just going to have you take a listen to when i was a little girl all i wanted to see was me in the media someone fat like me black like me beautiful like me if i could go back and tell little lizzo something i'll be like you gonna see that person but [\u00a0__\u00a0] is gonna have to be you okay um fat like me black like me beautiful like me that's what she wanted to see on tv when she was growing up not sure how old lizzo is she looks to be pretty young when were there not black people on tv when she was growing up i mean i i grew up with the hudson bowls the jeffersons in living color the fresh prince of bel air the cosby show what what is she people just say stuff online they just say things when they're on stages and people just applaud it's just this doesn't make any sense if i wasn't there i decided like i have a question how old are you did you grow up in the 1920s okay why didn't you see black people on tv that just sound like something you should just say it because you're giving an emmy speech and it's like cool to pretend that you i don't know overcame something the second thing she says is beautiful like me literally television was created to put beautiful people on screens right i thought that we were trying to go away from they're like oh people are too beautiful so let's make them fat and which i grew up without seeing clinical obese people on tv because it's not normal right i cannot stress this enough i like lizzo's music i think lizzo is a talented person it is sad to me that she is in a room of people that apparently hate her that keep applauding and celebrating her every effort to die right obesity is the number one killer in the united states heart disease that comes from obesity is the number one killer in the united states she's standing in a room and people are applauding her i just wanted to see people fat like me once upon a time by the way the only place that you could see people that were that large were at a circus you had to actually go to a circus to observe people that were that clinically obese right now you have lizzo that is looking around and saying i can't see these people on television because you shouldn't see these kinds of people on television we should not normalize seeing people that are harming themselves every single day growing closer and closer to death because of clinical obese if lizzo's fans loved her if lizzo's fans appreciated her if lizzo was in a room of people who actually wanted her to be around longer they would tell her lizzo i am so proud of all of the success that you have found in life but girl it is now time to lose weight you now have the money and the resources to lose weight right you can have a chef making your every meal you could hire a person to follow you around that's counting calories but instead we have amazon that goes to her and says hey let's make a series about how great and glorious and glamorous it is to be fat it's not it's not any of those things and then you have of course the institution and they go and they give her an emmy they award her for killing herself yeah we're watching basically a slow suicide that's what clinical obesity is i mean has anybody not watched my 500 pound life did do people actually think that when she goes home she's happy and she feels good every morning carrying around all that extra weight she doesn't so that's what i'd like to say about lizzo okay before i jump into some news stories i want to talk to you guys about expressvpn if you know me and i've listened to the show you know that i love to talk about all the things that are forbidden by big tech like how the trans agenda is killing children

okay now it's time for some topics du jour [Music] first and foremost i want to provide some clarity and some context and offer an apology for those of you that were listening last week uh when i covered a teacher in texas that had been fired regarding something that she had said pertaining to pedophilia you will recall it was a tick-tock video it was recording a student that was talking to their teacher about pedophiles and the teacher came back to that student and said quote stop calling them that you're not allowed to label people like that stop it diego we're not going to call them that we're going to call them maps minor attracted persons so don't judge people because they want to have sex with a five-year-old end quote so those remarks obviously went viral she eventually was fired i posted the clip of me discussing um that topic onto my instagram and a ton of you guys wrote under it and said candace you're taking her words out of context there was more to the story the students defended her you know you shouldn't be doing that of all people you know what it's like to be taken out of context i definitely do and i know that the media loves to create a circus without the full story uh and so when i saw your comments i pulled my commentary off of instagram and i texted my team and i said we need to look deeper into the story i'm always listening always growing um so we did look deeper into the story and not much has changed regarding the outcome but i do want to let you know that the superintendent at first apologized superintendent and the school board trustee daniel call said that he felt that her remarks were taken out of context um and he then made sure that they launched a deeper investigation on top of that her husband came forward and he gave this quote he said i happen to be the husband of the teacher in question i can tell you that we were shaken to the core about these accusations it is both scary and disturbing that an edited 18 second clip could destroy a 30-year career when taken completely out of context she is exemplary as a teacher and truly cares about the students needless to say we have spent many sleepless nights because of this cruel release of social media of the 18 seconds we pray that you and the rest of the board will see this for what it is and not allow an edited video destroy an innocent woman her career and her family in the process i want to thank you personally for the updated posts to begin to write this wrong so yes at initially daniel call changed his mind but then he after a further investigation said that the firing still holds and he gave this quote to the public he said any reasonable person that heard what the seven trustees heard would have voted to terminate amber parker there were more things the public may not know about that was included on the closed findings so all i can say is this is all the information that we have yes it seems that some people felt she was taken out of context certainly her husband did but ultimately the school board and the trustees felt after doing a deep investigation that yes the public knew more about it they would have fired her so i want to update that story i should have included all of this in my initial reporting of it moving on a story that i do not want to comment on because i don't know how to comment on it i really i don't know i have almost nothing left to say about christie tegan i thought we put her in a box and we sent her off and that really she should have had her social media accounts taken from her after we uh unpacked her extensive need to tell teenagers to kill themselves chrissy tegan you can't talk about a death call without bringing up chrissy teigen she loves suicide preferably telling people that they should be committing suicide and still has never apologized to any of those then teenagers involved because why should she have to she's christy tegan she's the wife of john legend she's a hollywood a-lister you can sort of see now that the public is trying to her pr team must be great they're trying to reintroduce us and make us forget that she's a total psychopath she is actually a psychopath um and they uh for whatever reason feel compelled to keep themselves in the media politically by just making extreme comments right so chrissy teigen if you did not know and i'm going to say this now because the time it felt inappropriate obviously she suffered a miscarriage it was i think about a year ago i could be wrong and we know that she suffered a miscarriage because they posted videos they named the son jack she was in the hospital they were trying to rescue his life and eventually she had a miscarriage according to christie tegan right she posted these extraordinary photos and i do want to show you some of these photos because at the time despite the fact that as a mother you felt so bad if you were like me i saw these photos and i said you know what it's a little weird that these photos were taken i'm gonna be honest i know that you guys felt that way she took these you know photos in the hospital right after having lost her son of her crying of her praying of her and john legend sitting let's take a look at some of these photos here's one as just one example she is yeah sitting on the bed in the hospital and she's crying it's a very sad photo but it begs the question who took the photo right like who actually after they lose their child who would be so invasive as to take their phone out or take a camera out and photograph a woman in this you know horrible position this very sad position but then there's another photo here's another one of her and john legend and he goes okay if john legend didn't take that photo of her initially who was the third person that was in this hospital during the time of covet lockdowns by the way when people were not even allowed to have their husbands in there when they were giving birth who could be so invasive as take a photo of the both of them in this moment this very vulnerable moment right we were all thinking it at the time but again this was a topic regarding miscarriage we just went whatever i i personally think christie tegan is addicted to social media she's addicted to getting attention and i thought that this was evidence of that and i also felt and i'm gonna say it now because it feels like it's okay to say it now then it was a pr strategy right if there was a firestorm about how disgusting and horrible of a person that she had been online to so many people and then suddenly she pops up she's pregnant and then she loses her child and rather than announcing that they lost their child uh they put these very graphic photos on the internet and once again the press then says oh forget all the suicide stuff that she she's so brave look at her she's photographing herself going through a miscarriage we love her again right wrong okay this is what i was thinking during the time i didn't say it but recently chrissy teigen i guess who just cannot get enough social media decided that she wanted to unearth that scenario and get more attention from it right so she initially said it was a miscarriage she now says that the loss of her son jack was the result of a life-saving termination actually wasn't a miscarriage she said he had no chance of survival so that they opted into getting an abortion i'm sorry what are you are you kidding you you can just update that so so you had the entire world mourning with you you released these photos the public and you said i had a miscarriage of you crying in a hospital right and the world came to your aid and said we're so sorry you're so brave for posting these photos but now you find it to be politically expedient to say that it was an abortion instead here's the quote she gave she actually said this quote let's just call it what it was it was an abortion an abortion to save my life for a baby that had absolutely no chance she also said that it was because of the supreme court's decision to overturn roe v wade that prompted her to reconsider how she spoke about her experience after telling her husband john legend that she sympathized with people who have had an abortion he helped her to understand that her own experience was actually an abortion oh okay so you just decided to reconsider a miscarriage and to categorize it as an abortion you sat down and said oh how can we get more attention because taking photos of ourselves going through this thing that should be incredibly personal between you and your husband having some third-party person capture it and then quickly putting it on instagram for likes and then having your pr agent get you a bunch of applause throughout the media applause oh she's so brave so it wasn't enough right now everyone's arguing about abortion you think you can insert yourself into this because you're a sick mentally ill individual okay chrissy teigen is mentally ill there is no question about this right if you want to talk about what social media causes the issues that it causes the mental illness that it causes we should be examining chrissy teigen as a prime example okay a prime example the fact that you would use a dead child for attention not once but twice right you just said oh it's evolved i'm going to actually metamorphomorphisize this thing that happened to me i'm going to metamorphosize first it wasn't miscarriage you felt bad for me but wouldn't you now think i'm so brave if i then said my miscarriage was instead an abortion this is what's going on in her sick twisted demented little head and she does it oh after seeing what the supreme court said i realized that my miscarriage was actually an abortion aren't i brave for doing that no chrissy you're a disturbed individual and you should have your account taken away from you right you should have had your accounts taken away from you you were telling children to kill themselves but now you literally need to put your phone down chrissy teigen where she should exist is in college textbooks psychology classes right when we look back on this era of social media and we talk about the various mental illnesses that has caused people we should be able to open a textbook and read about the case of chrissy teigen and the john legend that wouldn't stop her that's all i have to say about that next up let's talk about stacey abrams because when we talk about the cult of death of course we have the politicians that are trying to sell you that death is actually compassionate and here is what stacey abrams had to say about abortion on the view do you think there should be any legal limits on abortion such as the third trimester or viability i believe that abortion is a medical decision not a political decision and arbitrary arbitrary arbitrary politically defined timelines are deeply problematic because they ignore the reality of medical and physiological issues for example a six-week ban tells women they have to make reproductive choices before they know they're pregnant okay so uh politically defined timelines are arbitrary that's what she says right and then she proceeds to tell you about at six how at six weeks women don't know they're pregnant that's literally something that would be a politically defined timeline i knew i was pregnant both times before six weeks they're just saying that just something to say right now they just all decided to agree in lockstep that women don't know they're pregnant in six weeks that's a completely made-up thing and somehow this six-week mirage that they have made up has now transformed into a reason why at nine months people should still be able to abort their child this should of course be considered child sacrifice that's what it is this should be considered in the same context of what the aztecs did when they would sacrifice children while they built temples because that's what it is you're just sacrificing children but guys it's compassionate don't you understand don't you feel compassion for stacey abrams don't you feel compassion for the women that are choosing to abort their children at nine months in the womb don't you feel compassion for chrissy teigen who had a miscarriage and then magically transformed it into an abortion don't you aren't we all just feeling a little bit compassionate what about the fat people are you feeling compassionate for them they never get to see themselves on the screen they they turn on their tvs and they don't get to just see other people that are 400 pounds and 300 pounds and clinically obese and huffing and puffing going up the stairs there to feel compassion for them that's sad we need to show more of that on television or we could acknowledge the truth which is that it's a cult of death which brings me to the next story the next headline of a plus-sized philadelphia drag queen 25 years old died of a heart attack during a performance at a gay bar the medical examiner says that she was killed by obesity and diabetes no so at least the medical examiners can acknowledge truth 25 years old her name was valencia prime and she died mid-performance right while doing what they do best hosting her own party dancing on stage this could have been lizzo by the way this is why i say her fans must hate her because they continue to lie to her and they continue to celebrate her and they continue to award her statues and pretend that what she is doing is a good thing for culture while she kills herself which brings me to demi lovato if you guys know demi lovato she is a singer she is a performer she's very talented she's a wonderful voice she actually began her career on barney so she's kind of always been in the public eye from the time that she was a small child and i don't think there is a greater example of an artist today that has followed really the leftist cult meaning that everything that they sell she embraces and then she then sells to her followers i'm talking about body positivity she talks about her struggles with her body and now she kind of views people that are overweight as being brave and she encourages them and she applause them online uh demi lovato just going through her history with drugs and mental illness in 2009 she tried cocaine at 17 years old while working for the disney channel 2010 at 18 years old she entered a treatment center for the first time to address her issues with eating and self-harm among other issues in 2011 she left rehab and she revealed that she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2013 she checked into a los angeles sober house in 2018 she sought treatment again after a near fatal heroin and fentanyl overdose in 2021 she announced that she was non-binary and that she wanted to be referred to as they and them and also during an interview on cbs sunday morning she said that she smokes a little weed and she drinks moderately and referred to that as being californian sober 2021 in her peacock docu series she's saying to a ghost after it's supposedly revealed they had experienced trauma that was caused by sexism yeah i'm going to read that one again in her 2001 peacock docu-series she sang to a ghost after the ghost supposedly revealed to her they had experienced trauma that was caused by sexism and then recently she revealed that she re-adopted the pronouns she and her okay so i want to talk about her because as i said she is just evidence her life and i do actually say this with true compassion in my heart because i i see her entire life as one big cry for help and she keeps holding on to all of these left dispositions i guess hoping that they're going to help her if she embraces being non-binary if she embraces being california sober if she leans in to i don't know looking into ghosts and having a series about trying to find ghosts in reality what she wants to find is god what she's looking for is spiritual direction you know demi lovato is so emblematic of everything that's wrong with hollywood of what happens when you celebrate yourself right when you lean into mental illness talking about oh it's so brave to talk about your various mental illnesses it's so brave to be pop but you know body positive it's an act of bravery to change your pronouns in your bio and to identify as all of these different things ultimately because you're not happy with yourself these people are are miserable on the inside this is why the shia la la buff transformation i hope is something that demi lovato is paying attention to i want demi lovato to get better i actually i i feel such a sadness for her because everything that she is saying this attention that she's looking for when she pretends that it's about sexism it's about misogyny she's gay she's lesbian she went through a period where she was dating a woman uh and that's when she said she was non-binary at the end of the day she is a sad sad soul that is looking for direction and she's not going to find it in beverly hills she's not going to find it in los angeles she's not going to find it from the paparazzi she's going to find it when she begins living her life more conservatively when she stops following these hollywood trends these demonic hollywood trends and so she recently gave a statement that this current tour is going to be her last she posted this on a bunch of instagram stories saying that she was quote so effing sick i can't get out of bed i can't do this anymore this next tour will be my last i love and thank you guys end quote i hope that her real friends reach out to her i hope that her family surrounds her i i would hate to think that demi's life is going to be somehow shortened because she can't find the necessary direction that she needs and i hope that people that are watching this story aside from praying for her she does need our prayers learn a lesson actually take a second and examine the way that she has lived her life why it is that money and attention and applause fake applause and trophies like the one that lizzo is getting um don't actually fulfill you all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus we are going to expand on these topics so if you're not member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] you", "crTb4rN7EAQ": "all right guys question of the day have you heard about cultural Pharmacy of course you haven't because I made it up and I'm going to tell you about that also coming up we have another trans tick tocker and she is showing off her hysterectomy in a jar all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] okay so I asked you if you know what cultural Pharmacy is and of course the answer is you don't because I made it up I made it up because I was scrolling through Instagram and I saw this post from killer my Killer Mike is a rapper and he's also a friend of mine he's a very kind human being who I actually believe has good intentions all the time constantly trying to bring me together with people that are in Black Culture who don't like Candace Owens so I follow him on Instagram and he posted this the caption reads freedom of speech is a foundational tenet of a free Society allowing one's artistic expression to be used against oneself in the courtroom jeopardizes all of our freedoms now when I first read those couple of sentences I thought wow he's making a post about Alex Jones I can't believe Killer Mike is going to stand up and say that what happened to Alex Jones is wrong right that is freedom of speech in a courtroom and now what he's saying on a show and now they're suing suing him for what he's saying on a show and it's bad it's toxic and it's wrong but then his post went on his post says hip-hop culture has and will continue to be a defensive barrier against those who wish to take greater societies rights away maybe he means that a bunch of hip-hop stars are going to stand up and defend Alex Jones or maybe he's referring to something else and it turns out that he was referring to something else which is why he used the hashtag Luther Campbell is a free Patriot and he is referring to Luther Campbell who is a member of the rap group two Live Crew and he's referring to an old case that dates back to 1990 pertaining to obscenities obscenities in music so this was accompanying his post a picture of Luther Campbell and he is standing outside of the courtroom and there are a bunch of microphones in his face and he is holding a piece of paper as the judge came down with the decision and the caption of that photo reads Luther Campbell leader of hip-hop group of two Live Crew holds a copy of a federal judge's order ruling that his best selling album is obscene outside of the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale Florida dated June 6 1990. the judge said the album which is entitled as nasty as they want to be is an appeal to dirty thoughts and not to the intellect and the mind Bruce rogo who is Campbell's attorney is at the left a circuit court later said the album was not obscene so again this photo is being taken after he leaves the courtroom because the judge has said listen your music is actually too obscene and it's essentially not appealing to the intellect of our society now you asked me my opinion I am completely a free speech absolutionist I believe that people should say what they mean and what they want to so I'm not doing this monologue to say oh this was the wrong decision that he was allowed to put his album out and I am actually having this discussion because I do also believe that Free Speech has consequences and I want to talk about what the consequences are of a society which back in the 90s which is when I grew up I grew up in the 90s and I always say it felt like a better error like everybody was happier in the 90s today people seem so angry all the time they're just angry and they're shouting and they're upset and they're emotional and yet we've never been more privileged and back in the 90s people weren't this way I don't know if it's just because it was my childhood and everything's a little bit more delicate in your childhood but it just seems like people got along better and then you learn that the courtrooms were not happy the court was not happy to see that music was actually making a change and I'm wondering if we have as a society are now suffering the consequences of that cultural change all right so I'm just going to read you some of the tracks that are featured on this album as nasty as they want to be so that you can get an idea of what this album may have been about ready a song entitled me so horny dirty nursery rhymes break it on down put her in the buck I ain't bull the shop if you believe in having sex get the out of my house bad and Almighty so those are tracks that are on this album which the judge the initial judge thought was too obscene but then the Circuit Court said you know you know what freedom of speech and he's allowed to say what he wants yeah he is allowed to say what he wants he did say what he wanted and Killer Mike is reflecting on this as a win um for hip-hop culture and a win for freedom of speech it may have been a win for freedom of speech but it was not ultimately a win for society so this is almost the precursor to [\u00a0__\u00a0] right uh this idea that artists can just say whatever they want and there are no consequences because this adult is for this this music is for adults it's not for children even though we know that children are listening to this and now we live in this Society where people are angry we live in a very murderous time in America we live in a time where there's a lot of tension and I started thinking about the fact that music is in fact a frequency right when we talk about the air waves we're talking about actual waves and I believe that what you put into your ears you are putting into your mind and you are putting into your heart and it informs you as an individual frequencies invade your body that is a fact right and those frequencies are either medicinal or they're toxic so I became very conscious of how I felt when I listened to music right so if I listen to a rap song I feel sometimes angrier I feel sometimes Bolder in a weird way when I listen to hip-hop music and if I listen to something like classical music which my husband listens to and enjoys we play it sometimes when we're making dinner it makes me feel more intellectual which is funny that the judge said that this is not inspiring intellect I feel more intellectual it's an entirely different vibe in fact the inspection the expression that's a bad Vibe or that's a good vibe right she's a total Vibe but we're talking about our vibrations vibrations being a part of frequencies right so what vibe are you picking up what vibration are you picking up when you put music in your ears this is what brings me to the idea of a cultural Pharmacy right because this is a type of medicine whether it is good or whether it is bad I believe that our culture has corroded because of decisions like these right because we have decided that anybody can say anything which I don't disagree with fundamentally but I do disagree with culturally we are now seeing harsh consequences for example and something that we should always know China and Russia would never allow this onto their Airwaves Russia is known for having preserved classical culture China is now being recognized as a threat to American society China of course notoriously uses tick tock not to further a trans agenda no no they would never allow that in fact their government is pulling off any kinds of music where there's gender bending artists right they've they announced a few months back that no more of this is allowed we are not allowing social media to pollute the minds of our masses we're not going to allow these men they're dressed like women to have Tick-Tock accounts and to have Instagram accounts instead they use tick tock to further mathematics and to furb Sciences to teach children things that matter so essentially they're nurturing their intellect I think down the line nurturing a child's intellect is going to be a good thing it certainly has now represented a real threat to American society Russia is known to love the Arts ballet the Russian ballet is the tippity top of what you can aspire to right everybody it seems to be culturally it seems to be classically trained in Russian Society because they love the high Arts in America it's the exact opposite we use tick tock forward whatever it is we want because freedom of speech I guess so it's totally fine that there are adults teaching children which we're going to get into later on in the show that aspiring to remove parts of your body is cool it can be cool and it can be fun to do that and here's a little community that we've created online that will encourage you to do such things will encourage you to mutilate your own body and show you how awesome that is here is a little pocket of society on Tick Tock we're on Instagram that will inspire you to come out and talk about having mental disorders when in fact those communities are creating the disorders that we're talking about essentially what we have now is so much perversity and again it's always dressed up like diversity we just need to celebrate diversity we just celebrate that people are having different experiences but essentially what we have is that that perversity is breaking down people's psychological immune systems I always go back to that New York Post article that talked about that right that all of this content all of this music that we're listening to ultimately what it's doing this this High consumption of debauchery is it's breaking us down psychologically and everything that you're seeing in society is a result of that so the criminality that we are seeing in society is a result of that the various mental illnesses the new mental illnesses is a result of that the children who are confused and believe that they have to become extreme characters on the web to get attention is a result of a broken down Society what is the answer to this I don't have one right I I guess my what I'm trying to do is to just draw attention to it because I do believe that if we don't start making independent decisions within our own household to say no to this corrosion not to call for legislators legislate it right but rather for us to say no to this corrosion we are going to be a fostering a society of weak men and Forest during a society that cannot stand up against the Eastern Hemisphere and that's all I have to say about that okay guys before we continue I want to talk to you about front page magazine founded by conservative writer David Horowitz front page magazine has spent over two decades combating the

while you're there you can support their cause by making a tax deductible donation inside every Progressive is a totalitarian screaming to get out and no one understands that better and the team at front page magazine so go check out frontpagemac.com today okay now it's time for some topics to show [Music] so imagine if you are a parent in the Washington DC area and you're like you know what these inner city schools are bad I need to make sure that my kid is not going to public school things are going a little crazy and I'm going to work extra hard so I can afford to pay out of pocket to send my kid to private school because that's supposed to be better obviously it's supposed to be a little more sane since you're paying for it higher quality if you send your kids to private school or so you think and you drop off your little child let's say your child's two years old right because there's a private school that houses students from 18 months all the way up to sixth grade you're like yeah I feel good about this just dropped my kid off amazing and then a couple of days go by and you find out that your kids got some speaking issues so they're going to see a speech pathologist a teacher at the school by the name of Mr Powell okay that seems cool except you find out one day via an email that is uh sent out to you and the email heading is pregnancy announcement that Mr Powell is pregnant now guys I wish that I was just saying this to you because I'm wildly imaginative Tiff but no actually this is what is happening this is really a circumstance that is taking place and the school that it is taking place at is the river school so yes a speech pathologist his name is Tristan Powell is pregnant you want to know why Tristan's pregnant because it's not a mister it's actually a Mrs and it's not a he it's actually a her so what did the school do they scrambled and they sent out a pregnancy announcement to parents of the children that were in this class it says hmm we wanted to take an opportunity to share some exciting news with you though you may have already noted Mr Powell's growing belly Tristan is expecting a kiddo in mid-January of course you may have some questions about what that looks like for the manatee class so we wanted to share some FAQs with you as well parental leave Tristan is hoping to teach through December and possibly into January depending on the baby's arrival while he's off adjusting to being a new parent the River School will make sure there's no interruption to learning adventuring in the manatee class parental leave is very common at River and more information about specific coverage will be available closer to the date ah yes I'm sure the first concern that parents had was about parental leave next up Tristan's Journey Tristan will be a solo parents by choice a pregnancy has been a hopeful plan for at least a decade and Tristan is thrilled that it's finally happening Tristan will go by Abba which is Hebrew for Dad and uses the pronouns he him that's definitely what the parents were concerned about there is a pregnant man at school and first year they definitely must have been concerned about how much time this person was going to get off and then they were concerned about what pronouns like when you get back what do we call them oh Abba okay we're gonna call him great next up talking to the kids with preschool aged kids we tend to wait to announce a pregnancy to the class until closer to the date since we don't want to create anxiety about a teacher being out that said you are welcome to chat with your child at home if you'd like when we do chat as a class we will prepare the kids for Tristan's absence and explain the reason in age-appropriate ways for kids who may have associations with pregnancy and a certain Jenner a certain gender only girls and or moms can have babies Tristan uses the language of some boys have bodies that can have babies and I have the kind of body that can have a baby Isn't that cool for older kids Manatee siblings perhaps or manatees depending on how in depth you'd like to discuss this at home Tristan shares simply about his transgender identity by explaining I am transgender which means when I was born my grown-ups made a guess that I was a girl but when I grew up I told everyone that I'm actually a boy you are welcome to mirror this language at home if you'd like more resources and language about discussing trans and gendered Identity or explaining how pregnancy happens for curious kids we're happy to share some recommendations please let us know if you have any other questions oh pick me I have more questions how did adults meaningfully send out this absolute crap of an email to parents uh gaslighting them first and foremost like waiting till the third point to even address the fact that this is pointedly ridiculous and then going so far as to during that third Point tell them essentially that Tristan's a liar and what you need to do is you need to lie to your kids you need to tell your kids something as ridiculous as some boys have bodies that can have babies no no actually zero boys have bodies that can have babies there's on a single boy there's not a single man there's a single male there's only single male adult in the entire world that can have a baby especially a boy because first off a child cannot have a baby full stop right and then you're going to go out and pretend that a grown man is having a child if I was a parent I'd pull my child out of the school immediately because just imagine what is it possible for your child to learn in a classroom when they are existing under this sort of a lie it is quite literally one of the first things that you learn in school there's the boys bathroom there's the girls bathroom boys go and this bathroom girls go in this bathroom you should know whether or not you should be trying to stand or whether you should squat when you go pee pee this is the kind of language that is expected when you are in preschool right when you are as young as 18 months did I say to my son you got to go on the potty right potty training is a first step right these are all elements of potty training that people should understand but instead you have adults in a classroom that are going to try to convince children that men can give birth and not that they are learning speech from a mentally deranged adult that is what it is it's a mentally deranged adult that is playing dress-up a person that is not in a productive relationship which is further in this email right it just there's no one it's just going to be by by herself she's going to have this baby but we want you to Still Believe We want you to still be deluded we want you to essentially have no hallucination that actually this is just a man that's giving birth it's not a man that's giving birth it is not a man at all I do not understand how we have gotten to this point in our society I don't get it I am just flabbergasted that these emails are actually going out that we are now allowing people that are telling you they are mentally ill right during interviews when this Tristan sat down for an interview for this school that is filled with young children Tristan let them know that she was mentally ill she said I think I'm a man I'm a man please call me Tristan and my pronouns are Abba Abba I guess Hebrew for Dad I I want to be called Abba okay that's fine it's a Hebrew word but you're not a dad you're a mom you're about to be a mother Tristan this stuff frustrates me it actually makes me angry I I wish in so many ways that I was a parent at this school this is completely and utterly unacceptable and the administration needs to hear from it and the best way to let the administration hear about it is to simply pull your kids out of the school right a free market solution you do not have to send your children to an insane asylum moving on to the insane asylum that is Tick Tock keep telling you if your kid has Tick Tock get them off I'm gonna say that until I'm blue in the face if your children are on Tick Tock pull them off I'm making it a song because I think that's what Tick Tock is it's people singing and dancing and making things that are actually horrible and horrific appeal to children so now we have a transgendered another mentally ill tick-tocker that has just gotten a hysterectomy a hysterectomy not only they have a hysterectomy they have decided that they're going to turn it into a science project and display it in a jar for children to see how cool it is to mutilate Your Body by choice here's the video trigger warning yeah so in this hey y'all so I just got my uterus back and it looks so freaking cool trigger warning this has an organ and it is a wet specimen and it is my uterus plus the tubes as well so ready for the reveal this is it this is my uterus she scrubbed off all the blood that is my cervix that's what a cervix looks like y'all and these little strings right here are my Fallopian tubes but this is my uterus this is it compared to my head this little thing causes so much problems for everybody and I also got a LED plug-in LED stand with it so it lights up different color and Spins while it displays it which is so cool despite the trigger warning that this person provided I am still triggered I am triggered as a mother that is raising children in a sick Society I mean could you imagine that this is permissible on the web and yet we are being told that people like Donald Trump and people like Yay Kanye West are dangers that they are dangerous human beings right that they are not allowed to be on the internet and yet this is a person that is just mutilated their own body and is intentionally trying to make it seem like a cool aspect by putting it on the web and showing a bunch of children that they can do it too you can put it in a jar look oh my gosh it's my fallopian tool my fallopian tubes now I will never be able to become pregnant because I just had a doctor a doctor that should be in prison do this to me because of how I was feeling on the inside and the reason that I was probably feeling about this way on the inside is because I have some underlying trauma or underlying sadness or underlying need for attention best evidence by the fact that I am on Tick Tock looking for likes and views for my Fallopian tubes that I'm putting on the web right that's what's going on this is a person that needs attention and for attention people are becoming more and more extreme they're pretending that they have gender identity issues because they like that it gives them a false Community online this is sick right you should feel disgusted when I first saw this video I did not want to eat after it and yet we still have parents who think that their children being on Tick Tock is absolutely fine it's not fine I stand strongly against this we are not going to be able to survive as a society if we do not address this and call it what it is on its face all right it is mental illness I said in my George Floyd documentary and I'm going to say it again we have to have the courage to scream the truth louder than they scream the lies moving on you guys if you are looking for an update on pronouns I told you guys I stopped learning letters after LGBT once I started adding like you know qrs's and T's and using B's I said you know what I'm out so I'm not gonna play the game with you and now of course we have all these pronouns and we have these organizations that are telling you that this list just updates I don't know how often but it feels like almost every day well if you're somebody who tries to keep up with all of the pronouns lucky for you the LGBT Foundation sent out a tweet and this is what the Tweet says happy International pronoun Day to you whether you use and here is a list of pronouns Z them she her day Dem he him they them they Fair yeah then it concludes by saying pronouns or any others this is just a short list of some example pronouns that people may be using you will never know someone's pronouns until you ask right we're just giving you a short list maybe they're Fae for a jijam clique you don't know and your pronouns might be and if someone does not call you obviously it's because they're a bigots in fact that is my pronoun I just realized that I like this game and my pronoun is as you mentioned say it back to me right now say back to me I want you I don't care where you are right now I want you to say that pronoun back and if you don't say it right it's because you're a racist you hate black people it's because you are a misogynist because I'm a woman I just identify as soon as and that's it we're not crazy you're crazy you're crazy if you think that's crazy again Peak gaslighting happening in our society jumping on uh I think I'm starting to like Meghan Markle it's weird like now I'm enjoying her like first she frustrated me and made me angry but now I'm enjoying her because I'm curious I'm suspenseful I'm at the edge of my seat trying to figure out how many times one woman can tell you she's been victimized and Meghan Markle has been victimized again again no no not that time or the time before the time before that or the time before that the time before that time again into the future the time after that the time just before it and the chime the time three weeks after today where she will also be victimize but this time was about after the fact of the first time Meghan Markle has again been victimized or something so um you remember the interview that she did in the cut magazine where she you're not gonna believe it she actually talked trash with the royal family I know she's never done that before but she did do it in the cut magazine interview and it created a firestorm of press but now she's giving another interview to the interview to basically say that she was a victim of the magazine article even though they quoted what she said she says now that she was just too trusting and open with the writer of that magazine uh where she once again said stuff against a royal family and she also hinted that the entire chat that she had with that author was never meant to address her feelings about the monarchy except she did address her feelings of the monarchy and the author wrote about her feelings about the monarchy and then she faced a bitter backlash over those feelings she was the cover of their August issue but it's somehow their fault that she said it she didn't mean to say it she did say it but it's the cuts Magazine's fault you guys get it right so anyways I'm putting together a list of all of the ways in which which Meghan Markle has been victimized and who has victimized her and I want you to know who Charmed Meghan Markle and I am committed to keeping this list first she was victimized by her own father she was also victimized by her own sister if you remember she was clearly victimized by the royal family despite the very little time that she spent with them she spoken out against the victimization that she is suffering because of climate change yes her and Harry are very involved and of course racism because she's going through that and she's a victim of racism all the time in case you forgot Meghan Markle was also a victim of a Dish show commercial when she was a small child she shared that moment um uh I think it was on her archetype podcast where she saw a commercial and the woman was washing dishes and she was like oh my God why is it a woman that's washing dishes that's victimization right there Meghan Markle at like 10 years old victimized by Dawn or Procter and Gamble soap whatever it was that's sad she was victimized by The Daily Mail she sued them remember they victimized her and just last week she was telling us that she was victimized by Deal or No Deal the first show that she was on and it was victimization because they objectified her which is really surprising because she took the job they told her that she was going to have to stay in a bikini and I guess after doing that for a while she decided that actually I'm a victim of accepting this job author and I offer in fact I'm actually a victim of having applied for the job why did I apply for this job I don't know probably because the people of the deal are no deal or a bunch of misogynists and they objectified her and I feel sad she also of course now is a victim of the cut interview and I've heard that she might be a victim of a cat a Starbucks employee from 2014 who gave her her Latte when it was a little cold okay I made up the cat and the Starbucks thing but I think it's possible because as I said into the future there will be more instances in which Meghan Markle is victimized we just have to hang on and I am committed to maintaining this list I'm now with you Meghan Markle and I I can't believe that anybody hasn't seen how you have been suffering you have a little princess that has been suffering for a very long time and I'm glad that you have this entire podcast that is dedicated to how sad you are to be incredibly rich and married to a prince alright guys let's get into some comments all right so I got a comment here you guys know that I like to look at your comments online because it keeps me alive to how you guys are feeling and I think it's important for me to always know what you guys are thinking about my podcast so this is from haha Herbie um he writes I think it's crazy that as black folks we will say we love all black people as long as they agree with our beliefs I celebrate Candace Owens like I would Issa Ray she's intelligent grounded and honestly says things that our community needs to hear thank you I do appreciate that a lot and I appreciate it because there is this remarkable double standard it shows you that people just pretend to care about black voices they pretend to want black people to do well they pretend that we're facing this tremendous struggle in society because our voices aren't heard while at the same time those very same people a lot of them keep insisting on my censorship they keep insisting that the press and the media rejects me they keep insisting I'm not even black right like suddenly because I don't agree with groupthink that I'm not allowed to be black like you can just magically wave a magic wand Bond and make me not black and they've tried that they have denigrated my character for years it's incredible what is allowed to be on the internet that is said about me I it's a God forbid you uh make a comment in support of January 6 protesters you're inciting violence but if you outright call Candace akun and Uncle Tom and if you issue threats against her routinely it is totally fine right and so yeah I do think that it shows the stunning hypocrisy of the left but more importantly the stunning hypocrisy of Black America and its treatment towards black people who are conservative moving on this comment is from Connor Christmas Connor is responding to us having covered the Congressional candidate that put out a porn tape on PornHub and he says I can't stand him but the decriminalization of sex work I agree with in Australia and Brisbane City they have legit brothels and you never see prostitution on the streets or hear about it even in the red light districts then in the United States where it's ill you go everywhere except parts of Nevada I see it everywhere this is actually a much larger conversation that we need to have as success as a society about whether or not sex work should be criminalized and there are arguments on both sides for sure right uh when you criminalize sex work sometimes you're criminalizing victims and it can be someone who was forced into prostitution or someone who is destitute and those individuals may need help but the problem with when you say that is totally fine uh to be a sex worker is that what you're signaling to society is that we are creating a market for sex workers and as I have said on this show repeatedly after speaking with Tim Ballard and learning how connected the human sex trafficking rings are to America and our demand for pornographic material Having learned how many sex trafficking victims are found on PornHub and what it would signal if we said actually we don't we actually are even making our our sex trade even larger prostitution everywhere is okay what it would signal to people that are sex trafficking children and our sex trafficking adults around the world is that our Market has gotten even bigger and that and so that they should continue to execute these horrific crimes against children so it's a bigger discussion and we should definitely have it on a different day next comment this one's from Robert G Robert G says to me by the way you don't have to be an atheist to be a narcissist they don't always go hand in hand quit putting labels on people oh my bad that is the only thing that you are good at um hey Robert I didn't put the label on him the Congressional candidate with the label on him so there you go I was just reading that he felt it was necessary to state that he was an atheist and the reason why he is putting that label on his video is because he's signaling to other people that somehow uh if you believe in God I guess is what he's trying to do if you believe in God uh you're maybe shouldn't vote for him right he's he's basically saying I'm far left and the person under him commented why the hatred towards atheists I don't have hatred towards atheists at all I am just remarking on the fact that every leftist is an atheist show me one that is not an atheist I mean seriously if you are a far left leftist you basically are committed to nihilism you basically are committed to the over governance and the belief that your government can rescue you from everything that your government will deliver you from all evil and it's just been my personal experience which is what this podcast is all about that when I find somebody that is far left I also find an individual that doesn't believe in anything really other than themselves and that's all I have to say about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "DXUc7m04kwo": "ladies and gentlemen I am back after a one week break I know that you guys missed me last week I have so much that I want to say of course because a lot of things have happened in the news the question of the day today is the letter Q redundant I'm just kidding guys that's not actually the question of the day I'm just telling you guys that I did have a 10-minute debate with my husband on a walk I've been holding this inside and I just think I want to bring this to you guys and your homes I think the letter Q is a little bit redundant I'm thinking about it because my child is learning his ABCs and every time they get to Q the guy in the screen is like you know Q makes the sound if we didn't have the letter q we would just be using a k and a w it's actually not a needed letter to produce any word like you can't just say like we don't need a of course you need a you can't produce the word Apple that sound without the letter A but any keyword you can actually spell it out without the letter Q anyways guys that was a little sidebar and now you're going to be thinking about it all day the real real question of the day is do you know what the Streisand Effect is you might it's definitely happening right now pertaining to Kyrie Irving plus we're going to cover bad baby I think that's how you say her name you probably know her better as the cash me outside how about that yeah that girl remember her from the appearance on Dr Phil on Dr Phil which was years ago well she's been invited to give a speech to the Oxford Union about her business Endeavors business Endeavors meaning making 50 million dollars a year on only fans yep all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] thank you okay guys I don't want to get carried away but the answer is of course Q is a redundant letter you just don't need it you literally don't need Q the alphabet should have just been 25 letters back to the real question of the day the stri sand effect in case you don't know what it is it's a phenomenon that occurs when an attempt to hide remove or censor information has the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of that information often via the Internet and it is actually indeed named after Barbara Streisand what essentially happened was that she attempted to suppress the California Coastal records projects for photograph of her Cliff top residence in Malibu California now because she went through tremendous efforts to suppress it it actually increased awareness of her house and an inadvertently Drew more attention to the photograph itself back in 2003 so now we call it the Streisand Effect when that happens when you try to censor something and then everybody starts to look at up and wants to watch it or to see it bringing this up today because unless you have quite literally been hiding under a rock you have been paying attention to the fact that the only topic of discussion over the past four days has been Kyrie Irving Kyrie Irving is a basketball player a tremendous basketball player who is in a lot of trouble with the NBA now why is Kyrie in trouble with the NBA well I want to make sure that we unpack this story slowly so that you can form opinions that are based on facts and not based on the emotion that is perpetually in the media so Kyrie Irving tweeted this if you're listening to this podcast there is no commentary on the Tweet whatsoever it is simply a link to amazon.com to a documentary that is entitled Hebrews to Negroes wake up Black America so he essentially tweeted a link to a documentary that is available for every single person to watch on Amazon it's not like he directed your attention to an obscure website he just dropped the link and this created an absolute Firestorm online the next thing that I saw was a statement that the Brooklyn Nets Nets put out in regards to Kyrie's press conference so there was a firestorm Kyrie had a press conference where the journalist pressed him on why he shared this documentary and the Brooklyn Nets issued this statement regarding that press conference they said quote over the last several days we have made repeated attempts to work with Kyrie Irving to help him understand the harm and danger of his words and actions which began with him publicizing a film containing deeply disturbing anti-semitic hate we believed that taking the path of Education in this challenging situation would be the right one and thought that we had made progress with our joint commitment to eradicating hate and intolerance we were dismayed today when given an opportunity in a media session that Kyrie refused to unequivocally say that he has no anti-semitic beliefs nor acknowledge specific hateful material in the film this was not the first time that he had the opportunity but failed to clarify such failure to disavow anti-Semitism when given a clear opportunity to do so is deeply disturbing is against the values of our organization and constitutes conduct detrimental to the team accordingly we are of the view that he is currently unfit to be associated with the Brooklyn Nets we had decided that Kyrie will serve a suspension without pay until he satisfies a series of objective remedial measures that address the harmful impact of his conduct and the suspension period served is no less than five games wow that's a very strong statement from the Brooklyn Nets saying that he is unfit to be Associated based on the words that he shared during this press conference he offered no words and no commentary when he shared a link to this documentary again freely available on Amazon for any person to watch but apparently the words of his press conference is what has set them off and they are realizing that he is not condemning anti-Semitism so when I saw this post I went wow what did Kyrie Irving say obviously he must have said something that was horrific and which all of us should get on board and condemn he must have something that was so bad that the Brooklyn Nets the NBA Association which painted the floors of with black lives matter right and even though black lives matter was leading to looting and rioting and people were dying in these BLM loops and riots they still stood by and said this is totally fine because black people have to be able to express themselves so obviously reading the statement he must have really tripped into some territory of wrongness and that is worthy of the suspension then I actually listened to Kyrie Irving in his words and I could not believe that in the Nets had the ability to say that he was unfit to associate with them based on these words take a listen right are you sorry I'll take my responsibility for posting that some things that were questionable in there untrue like I said in the first time you guys asked me when I was sitting on that stage I don't believe everything that everybody posts it's a documentary so I'm taking my responsibility it seems like Adam Silver wanted to hear the word that I apologize or in your mind you said I didn't mean to cause any harm were you apologizing or not I didn't mean to cause any harm I'm not the one that made the documentary I think uh some of the criticism of the Jewish faith in the community for sure some points made in there that were unfortunate Tyree are you surprised that you did hurt people uh surprised that I did hurt people are you surprised that reaction some of the things that you did hurt people yeah I think I can ask a better question it's just where were you when I was uh a kid figuring out that uh 300 million of my ancestors are buried in America where were you guys asking those same questions when I was a kid dealing with learning about the traumatic events of my familial history and what I'm proud to come from and why I'm proud to stand here and why when I repeat myself that I'm not going to stand down it has nothing to do with dismissing any other race or group of people I'm just proud of my Heritage and what we've been through and uh the fact that this has pinned me against the Jewish community and uh I'm here answering questions of whether or not I'm sorry or not on something I didn't create and it was something I shared and I'm telling everybody I'm taking responsibility then that's where I sit so you know these same questions that you guys ask me dealing with it as being a melanated pigmented person all around the world and dealing with racial biases against my skin color demeaning me because of my religious beliefs and I'm still sitting in the sea standing so I take my full responsibility again I'll repeat it for posting something on my Instagram or Twitter that may have had some unfortunate falsehoods in it but I also am a human being that's 30 years old and I've been growing up in a country that's told me that I wasn't worth anything and I came from a slave class and I come from the people that are meant to be treated the way we get treated every day so I'm not here to compare anyone's atrocities or tragic events that their families have dealt with generations of time I'm just here to continue to expose things that our world continues to put in darkness I'm a light I'm a beacon of light that's what I'm here to do you guys ask me questions about basketball I give you my expert opinion you guys ask me about other things I give you my opinion and it's met with whatever you believe the perception or the deception is you guys investigate my life every day and you justify it by serving your own purpose which I honor I would like the same respect in return figuring out just like anyone else so please keep that same energy when we're talking about anti-other things because just because I posted documentary doesn't mean I'm anti-semitic and doesn't mean that I'm automatically standing with everyone that is believing in this so it's unfortunate timing that we're in but I'm glad that I could stand on the truth because I'm not afraid of these mics these cameras I used to be looking everyone in the eye and telling the truth and I'm proud of who I am you can label that you put on me I'm able to dismiss because I studied I know the Oxford dictionary you look it up right it's one of the biggest mistakes I had in being a kid was not knowing European or Western language until I started looking it up and understanding the definitions and why they say if you want to trick a black person put in a book I was wondering my whole life why they said that now I'm 30 years old and I know reading is a superpower because it helps me understand where I'm going and where I come from like a tree with roots can I read the the documentary listed among the falsehoods it said the Holocaust didn't happen those false foods are unfortunate and it's not that I don't believe in the Holocaust I never said that never ever have said it it's not come out of my mouth I never tweeted it I never liked anything like it so the Holocaust in itself is an event that means something to a large group of people that suffered something that could have been avoided no one said we had to practice racism no one said we had to treat each other like garbage no one said that I had to stand here today and understand that many people that come from Generations 60 years ago 40 years ago enslaved some of my ancestors still spiritually mentally and emotionally and it's still going on you guys are asking me respectfully to speak on something that was a documentary that I had nothing to do with I didn't make it so just please keep that same energy when you guys are addressing me okay for the record do you have an anti-semitic beliefs again I'm gonna repeat I don't know how the label becomes Justified because you guys ask me the same questions over and over again but this is not going to turn into a spin around cycle of questions upon questions I told you guys how I felt I respect all walks of life and embrace all walks of life that's where I sit I think what people want to hear though is just say yes or no on that question yes or no I cannot be anti-semitic if I know where I come from I cannot be anti-semitic if I know where I come from Kyrie did you personally meet with the ADL I was informed that they wanted to have a meeting and we handled it so I wanted to play that press conference in its entirety because it is important it's important to underscore first and foremost the absurdity of the media the way that they are behaving in that press conference they're essentially approaching him pretending that every single word of the documentary that Kyrie Irving did not make he has to answer for could you imagine a world in which everything you watch right you are somehow now responsible for every single word within it notably absent by the way is the Press going up to Jeff Bezos who is the owner of Amazon who runs Amazon and saying hey why did you allow this documentary to be on Amazon there's no outcry there's no everybody delete your Amazon accounts because of this documentary they are putting this firmly and squarely on Kyrie Irving which is problematic in the first place I want to also make it clear that in listening to his words it is pointedly ridiculous that they would say that he is unfit to be associated with there was nothing that he said but I would say that he is unfit to be associated with because he very clearly condemns the falsities in the movie he says I do not think this way he actually calls them falsehoods that are unfortunate right he says that that is not what I said do not attribute every word in this documentary to what my beliefs are he also very clearly stipulates to them when they ask him are you anti-semitic he clarifies that he's not anti-semitic now why is Kyrie Irving saying that why is he saying I can't be anti-semitic why is he saying that a couple of breaths after he talks about the Oxford dictionary so here is the definition of Semitic straight from the Oxford dictionary it's relating to or denoting a family of languages that includes Hebrew Arabic and Aramaic and certain ancient languages such as Phoenician and Acadia Indian constituting the main subgroup of the afro-asiatic family the second definition listed is relating to the people who speak Semitic languages especially Hebrew and Arabic so clearly what Kyrie Irving is saying based on that definition is that he believes that he is Semitic that he hails from maybe Africa or from Asia which is what the documentary explores I'm going to give you my feedback because obviously I watched the documentary after listening to this right his feedback is do not make the word Semitic just about Jewish people in America it includes a lot of other people okay now you might disagree with that you might disagree with the Oxford dictionary definition but you can't be mad at him for stating the actual Oxford dictionary definition the last thing that I want to say here just regarding his press conference and I want to say this really from the heart because there was so much pressure that was put upon me to condemn Kyrie Irving right to condemn Kyrie Irving based on this press conference to basically decide that his pain is irrelevant when I watched this press conference I felt Kyrie's pain I felt his pain and I will say this emotionally and not rationally as a black person people don't often think about how bizarre it is that we don't know where we come from right we don't know if you ask the majority of white people they'll say oh my family's from Scotland my husband's family can go back so many generations and talk about where they're from in England and when you talk to most people they have this sort of cultural understanding of their history we don't it's a weird feeling you do sort of feel out of place and yes of course it's because of the slave trade and I'm not throwing that on anybody I'm not saying that somebody else's fault but what Kyrie Irving says is that you can't pit atrocity against another velocity and basically say that his pain doesn't matter that his Noble pursuit of wanting to know where he came from even if he landed on the wrong conclusions is something that he is valid and feeling it's a journey that he is valid and wanting to go on and wanting to partake in so no I'm not going to turn my back on Kyrie Irving and pretend that he's an awful human being based on this press conference it's wrong there are a lot of people that feel that they are in pain from the Jewish Community because they're upset that he shared this link but also if you're not paying attention there are a lot of black Americans that are telling you that they feel that they are in pain because you're telling them that they're not allowed to feel the way they feel about about not understanding their Roots following the statement that was made by the Brooklyn Nets they they then came back and they have listed the six steps that Kyrie Irving must complete to return back to the Brooklyn Nets and here's what they are ready the first thing that Kyrie Irving must do is apologize for linking the movie let's stop right there that is an absurdity okay there's an absurdity because LeBron James if you do not remember has never been more hateful than throughout the entire BLM riots in fact he notoriously posted a thing on Twitter which was regarding the Jacob Blake police shooting which they were valid in attacking Jacob Blake who was attacking them first they would have been dead if they did not take action but he basically posted something that said to the police officers you're next a threat to police officers for doing their job and trying to have a violent criminal stop attacking them nobody cared nobody cared at all nobody cares about his rhetoric against white people nobody cares that he's lied and said that we are literally being hunted in the streets remember when he talks about that during BLM and that has inspired hatred toward white people the NBA never cared about any of that they never told him that he would be in trouble for any of these Tweets in fact they love LeBron James as he gets right in line with whatever they say Kyrie on the other hand which by the way is my true opinion really got the NBA Association angry when he refused to get the covet vaccine so despite the fact that Kyrie Irving quietly supported the BLM movement he gave millions of dollars to the George Floyd family despite the fact that he is by no estimation a conservative or on the right they're angry at him because they feel that they have some ownership over his body and when he took a quiet protest and stance and decided that he was not going to get the coveted vaccine which now has been proven a completely valid stance I was one of the early ones too you're not just going to put something in my body because you're telling everybody that they should do it immediately to save the world it didn't make sense and the NBA is angry because Kyrie Irving held that stance and what better way than to try to hang him for sharing a link to a movie that the overwhelming majority of people that are weighing in did not watch movies three and a half hours long but nope the first thing he must do is apologize for linking the movie absent any comment the second thing that they want him to do is to complete the anti-hate causes that the Nets first mentioned on November 2nd it included a 500 000 donation to the Anti-Defamation League the ADL but last week at CAO it's but last week the ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said the organization could not accept the money while Irving refused to apologize so by the way he should never give a single right sent to the ADL they are a hate group they call me every single person a hateful human being they're essentially just like BLM right they say you can buy your way back into society it's like indulgences if you just give us a lot of money what that's completely foolish no you should not just take five hundred thousand dollars from somebody in order to get his job back I mean how ridiculous is that it's extortion at its finest the third thing that they want Kyrie Irving to do is to complete sensitivity training okay whatever that means the fourth thing is that he must complete anti-semitic and hate training both of which will be created by the Nets the fifth thing he must do is to meet with Jewish Community leaders in Brooklyn the sixth thing that you must do is meet with Net's owner Josiah to demonstrate the lessons learned and that the gravity of the harm caused is understood so this is now becoming basically a humiliation ritual right so I can't imagine just having shared a link to a movie even yes okay the movie had some falsehoods he's acknowledged that he immediately acknowledged it which was the right thing to do that there are some things in here that maybe are not correct he took ownership over that but despite doing that they're simulating him they just want to humility him they want to take money from him and they want to show to everybody else that we have the full power and control over our players and this gets into what Kyrie Irving said about feeling like he's still and emotional and a spiritual slave in this country I've talked about this often and it so resonates with me again I'm coming from a position of feeling and not a position necessary early effect but I have always had this feeling that I'm not really free right I'm not really free to be a black person unless I abide by somebody else's rules and not really free to say what I think unless I abide by somebody else's rules for a very long time it was difficult for me to say I do not support black lives matter I think that they are extortionists I do not want to have to be a victim because of the color of my skin I don't want to fund other groups and make them more powerful and secretly know that they're not actually helping black Americans get ahead and I felt relegated almost to that position based on the color of my skin that's what it means to be an emotional slave right is to be told perpetually that you have to be a victim and now in many ways they're proving his point that he is is trying to express to you guys that he has held on to this hurt from the time he was a little boy of not knowing where he came from and he felt that this documentary which by the way I watched and it looks like a PowerPoint it is so low budget and it's so poorly done and it's very confusing but despite me feeling all that all those ways about the documentary I do understand why the documentary makers as black people wanted to go on this journey to simply try to understand where they came from their conclusion is potentially wrong so let's relegate those conclusions to a debate let's have a conversation let's not further a divide between black Americans and Jewish Americans who are fighting to say no I'm the biggest victim no I'm the biggest victim maybe you have to get 500 000 to BLM to understand how we feel no you have to get five hundred dollars to the ADL to understand how we feel why don't we actually sit down and understand that there are a lot of people who are valid in the way that they feel let's hear those individuals and not censor them because censorship does not work it does not make the problem go away do you want to know what the actual result is by the way of the censorship that came the ADL is now calling for the documentary to be pulled down this documentary which was obscure in which nobody would have watched even though Kyrie Irving tweeted it is now the number one one thing watched on Amazon it's number one documentary on Amazon because everybody's wondering it's dry sound effect what the heck is all of the fuss about and beyond that now people are watching it assuming that everything in the documentary is true these these are real comments that are happening online pay attention to the trends of Kyrie right the hashtag Kyrie on Twitter if you go under the comments if you go onto Facebook and you look at the discussions that are happening all across America they believe that everything in this documentary is true because of how vicious the media was in their overreaction and how vicious they are being in their punishment towards Kyrie Irving so what I really want to say to you guys is understand that that's how it works if you're not going to be bold enough to have tough discussions you're instead going to essentially hang Kyrie Irving right for perhaps sharing something that he shouldn't have shared without some commentary that hey everything in this is not true what you're going to end up with is more people that feel that everything in the documentary is true which is not really what you want to do ladies and gentlemen that is all that I have to say about that okay guys I want to take

[Music] now in case you're wondering whether or not there's more to the story pertaining to Paul Pelosi and the hammer incident at his and Nancy's residence in San Francisco I want you to know that you're a horrible backwards bigoted something phobe just kidding you're probably right and the media is going to Gaslight you for realizing that it's bizarre that we keep not knowing more of the story as it pertains to popular OC remember he had the DUI they just can't release the tape because they're still investigating bull crap notoriously When Brad parskel had a DUI the tape was on the internet and on Twitter within minutes but apparently Nancy Pelosi who to me is a part of the media Mafia there is a media Mafia that is operating there's no question about that it's media Mafia that censored the hunter Biden laptop because they wanted to make sure that it didn't impact the election results which it of course would have well this is the same media that is now centering the Paul Pelosi story because there's a lot more to the story we know that Polly Paul likes to drink at the very least we know that there's a lot of questions to be asked about how the person Nancy Pelosi who is the number two to the presidency would not have her home all across the United States secured right obviously we know that it can't just be that easy to walk up and to get into her house well the NBC made a mistake they tried to actually report on some lingering questions they did in fact report on some lingering questions but don't worry they immediately pulled the segment but not before people on Twitter began circulating the segment that they pulled down take a listen to NBC attempting some journalism Craig good morning when officers arrived here at the Pelosi home exactly a week ago today they initially didn't have any idea exactly what was going on they knew they had a high priority call on their hand what was unclear what was happening inside the property just behind me this morning Paul Pelosi is home back at the house that became a crime scene a week ago today NBC News learning new details about the moments police arrived sources familiar with what unfolded in the Pelosi residence now revealing when officers responded to the high priority call they were seemingly unaware they've been called to the home of the speaker of the house after a knock and announce the front door was opened by Mr Pelosi the 82 year old did not immediately declare an emergency or tried to leave his home but instead began walking several feet back into the foyer toward the assailant and away from police it's unclear if the 82 year old was already injured or what his mental state was say sources according to court documents when the officer asked what was going on defendant smiled and said everything's good but instantaneously a struggle ensued as police clearly saw David depap strike Paul Pelosi in the head with a hammer after tackling the suspect officers rushed to Mr Pelosi who was lying in a pool of blood what we do know is he brutally attacked Mr Pelosi and attempted to kill him after spending several days in the ICU Pelosi who is recovering from a fractured skull in serious injuries to his arm and hand is now home where Capitol Police remain on alert investigators have previously said Pelosi did not know to Pap when the 42 year old broke into his home why Pelosi didn't try to flee or tell responding officers he was in distress is unclear fear takes over fear freezes people this morning the 82 year old lucky to be alive after an intruder nearly killed him in his own home law enforcement law enforcement officials tell us the bottom line here is this was a terrifying situation we still don't know exactly what unfolded between Mr Pelosi and the suspect for the 30 minutes they were alone inside that house before police arrived officials who were investigating this matter would not go into further details about these new details Craig back to you yeah one thanks for sure though he is lucky to be alive Miguel among Air Force Miguel thank you yeah I'm opposed to believe and had his house broken into opened the door and told police that he was fine right it might be relevant to some of these lingering questions that we have my question would be was Paul Pelosi maybe at the bar with this guy did he invite him over for a little late night cocktail and things got a little Haywire that story would make sense to me right it's a little bizarre that the glass shards when you're looking at them apparently this is a break-in but the glass shards are all on the outside but to ask these questions would make me a conspiracy theorist not a journalist a question that every well-meaning journalist should be asking themselves I don't know we're never going to be able to find out at least not until midterms are over because at all costs they must bury the story and we may not find out beyond that of course we are told that there was somebody else in the car with Paul Pelosi when he got his DUI we don't know who it is maybe it was David to pay himself David de Pate by the way that that's the name of the assailant who did in fact hit Paul Pelosi with a hammer I'm not sure why he did it where did he get the hammer who owns the hammer is this a hammer that was inside the residence therefore making it impossible for the person to have broken in with the hangar all of these questions again should be asked in a world where we actually have a media that is committed to finding the truth instead we have a media that is committed to acting part and parcel to our state it's a state-run media like you would see in a communist country and their job is to protect government officials like Nancy Pelosi who operates like a thief as does her husband who is traitor of the year every year I wonder how that's possible I would again like to stress that NBC deleted this video so in case you're thinking there is a cover-up it is because there is clearly a cover-up happening all right I want to talk to you guys about a Ministry that I am super passionate about pre-born pregnancy clinics Freeborn is a pro-life Ministry that provides ultrasounds to life affirming centers around the nation something I talk about often when it comes to the issue of abortion is how impactful it is to see your child's face and hear their heartbeat and ultrasound it is such a profound experience and one that solidifies the reality that there is in fact a human being growing inside of you pre-born understands the importance of this experience from others which is why they provide ultrasounds to women who are considering abortion when a mother sees their child and hears their heartbeat she will more often than not choose Life One ultrasound is just 28 or you can sponsor five ultrasounds for one hundred and forty dollars and now through a match your tax deductible gift is doubled saving twice as many babies lives to donate securely dial pound 250 and say the key word baby that's pound 250 baby or go to preborn.com Candace that's preborn.com Candace if you call yourself pro-life Now's the Time to speak for these children visit preborn.com Candace today moving on to the state of college campuses which is deteriorating not just the United States but also abroad Oxford University yes very highbrow it's Oxford of course of course this is the kind of school you want to get into my husband graduated from Oxford University what a smart chap he is well they have something known as the Oxford Union where they have political thinkers come and they debate issues that are relevant I know this because I was very honored to have received an invite from the Oxford Union and I participated in one of these debates two years ago about whether or not Trump should be president and it was great it really is a wonderful tradition that they have and now it's time to ask questions about the trajectory of that tradition the trajectory of the Oxford Union because they have now invited bad baby in case you don't remember who bad baby is she found her Fame on Dr Phil when she told him to cash me outside how about that just honestly just just take a listen in all these hoes laughing like so funny she's talking about the audience that they're laughing at her did did you say that the the hoes are laughing yep so the audience are a bunch of hoes yeah [Applause] yeah yeah yeah catch me outside how about that yeah that doesn't really sound like English definitely not the kind of English that's your land you speaking in front of the Oxford Union cashmere how about that but that is exactly where you could cash her today she was invited to speak at the union regarding her success now by the way do not fault this girl at all I am a free market capitalist and right now there is a market for stupid and she has made 50 million dollars in one year okay so she should be laughing at me right because this girl is wealthy and she is Rich because she started in only fans account and since we live in a pornographic nation which people were excited and sitting at the end of their seats to watch that young girl once on Dr Phil turn 18 she made an incredible amount of money because she was willing to take her clothes off so again joke's on me maybe she should be speaking to the Oxford Union and explaining to people how yeah it is possible to make money without having a single modicum of intelligence you just have to understand that in today's markets excels in Western culture sex cells we are an indecent culture and we are a corroding culture and there are a lot of people who if they understood that could have a lot more money than they had today they could definitely afford money at the grocery store they wouldn't even be concerned about inflation bad baby she's not concerned about inflation right she's concerned about whether she wants to fly business or first class to England so that she can speak in front of the Oxford Union again sad State and commentary on the state of things today moving on guys we definitely need to jump into this story uh because it's important it's important because if you don't know Dwyane Wade speaking of the NBA and things that NBA players condone that don't seem to impact their reputation Dwyane Wade is a basketball player he is married to the actress Gabrielle Union Duane Wade has a son a son who thinks that he is a girl and Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union believe that is a form of acceptance to encourage these thoughts that their young son is having so notoriously when he the son's name used to be Zion notoriously when Zion was 12 years old he basically came out and said actually no I'm a woman and Gabrielle Union took him to a pride parade and they're like yes we're just going to support this now Zaya now known as ziya he actually changed his name to Zaya legally is getting all of these contracts for modeling is walking Runway shows because we live in this perverse society that is actually celebrating what is really a mental disorder right General dysphoria is a mental disorder and if you had parents that loved you and cared about you they would want to get you help I always correlate the transgender discussion to anorexia right I used to have anorexia you can find the information pertaining that in my book I've talked about it openly and I am just so grateful that as a society we recognize that anorexia is in fact a mental disorder right if you are thin and you think that you are fat you have a mental disorder if you are thin as I was it was very very thin and that you think that you need to control aspects of your life by not eating as I did then you have something that is a mental disorder right you're trying to relieve stress in all of the wrong ways fortunately when I was young we just said you got to fix that it's a problem and it's wrong now you have kids that have mental disorders and you would have adults that would say um you know what you shouldn't eat today if you're anorexic you shouldn't eat for the next three weeks let's see how long you can go without eating because I want to affirm what you believe that you are and if you believe that you're fat and you don't want to eat for three weeks I'm a loving parent and I'm going to let you do that yeah it's pretty crazy to even consider that plausibility but that is what is happening and it is even more extreme because we are affirming individuals like Zaya right who are eventually going to want to not just say I don't want to take any hormones or I want to skip puberty but they're eventually going to mutilate their bodies well Gabrielle Union is not actually Zaya's mother stepmother yes but not her actual mother and her biological mother is now standing up her name is Siobhan Wade and she is accusing Dwyane Wade of exploiting their 15 year old transgender daughter for financial gain and she's begging a court to intervene to stop her referring to ziya from changing her name and gender on her birth certificate she wants to end this right that is a strong mother standing up and saying this has gone far enough I do not care that she is receiving all of these cash and all this offers because we have a culturally sick Society I am the mother I want to protect my child and Dwyane Wade essentially is saying I'm not taking any advantage uh we are me and Gabrielle Union are just supporting ziya on his journey and that is totally fine and it's not totally fine there's an element of this that makes me believe that Dwyane Wade is sick there is something wrong here he's living out something through his child right I can't believe that any adult that does not themselves have did themselves have a mental disorder or themselves are just looking for attention online and likes because it's trending to say I support the lgbtqrs society right I cannot believe that any well-meaning adult would allow their child to go down this path but allow their child to accept money for harming themselves right we know where this is going to end we know where it's going to end when you wake up one day and you realize it actually no you cannot have a productive family you cannot have a productive lifestyle if you are making a decision to mutilate your body right you're going to become a candidate for big Pharma drugs and pharmaceuticals for the rest of your life we know all of these things and yet people are too scared to say it because they don't want to be called a transpho well guess what I'm happy to be called a transphobe when it comes to standing up for children and that's all I have to say about that okay I want to take a moment to talk to you guys about expressvpn you know I love this company because they keep my internet data

don't start crying out of nowhere they learned this behavior as children and no one ever intervened and corrected it and so now white women are walking around with literally weapons in their eyes at any moment's notice it is so important that we are watching what we're teaching our children and correcting and intervening behavior because this is what they grow into we are the ones responsible for how this next generation is going to behave and interact with each other white women are literally targeting an entire community of people with just their tears what in the world are you girl bob let

out there are you crazy it's dangerous out there but it was sarcasm i know that there's great places in africa but people took it really seriously yeah yeah yeah just be very clear it's one of the things i see all the time is that everybody's saying let's go back to africa has clearly never been yeah to say that there's there's some great scenery in africa but when you talk about what's actually happening on the ground in africa i tell you people pick a country what country would you like to move back to even though you've never been um and they have no idea because they've never been i've been to africa i mean it is you know a dollar today they'll take the dollar today you know they'll they they'll do not care their life expectancy is extremely low people are starving you know there's so many epidemics happening so many pandemics happening yeah um people are impoverished people don't have clean water exactly you know in in the majority of an overwhelming majority of these african countries so there is this ignorance of like we've somehow glamorized um black history and people believe that i don't know what's going to happen with this exactly africa i don't know why you better check your insurance policy buddy because it's a lot of dangerous stuff there and i don't think they can cover the biggest thing being slavery africa is a continent that still has a lot of slavery and um i talk about that too there's this ignorance of we're going to escape trump and move back to a country that has active slavery yeah yeah you know the video was too it was really about i was telling people stop why would you want to move there this is the greatest country stop blaming the in a lot of people we should move because the white man is making model as the white man is making our life so so bad quit blaming the white man for everything you know i could have blamed i mean we can all blame somebody for something but what is that going to do is it going to help you is it going to change anything blaming someone there comes a time in people now i understand that people grow up and they have a hard life but there comes a time where you have to start taking responsibility if me growing up in foster care i mean i i could blame my mama i could blame my daddy i could blame the system i could play the blame game my whole life but is that going to help me

question of the day should we be preparing for a nuclear war have you even thought about that have you ever paused throughout your day and said should I be preparing for a nuclear war plus coming up we have a New York Congressional candidate that has released a sex tape of himself on PornHub because he wants to promote his sex positive agenda including the legalization of prostitution um okay all that and more today on Kenneth Owens [Music] you know the pope made me feel Vindicated in my earlier opinions when conflict broke out between Russia and Ukraine every single person I promise you it felt like every single person left and right instantly got on board with the left's perspectives we had just faced this understanding that we had been lied to repeatedly about covid and that it was this sort of Global scam about getting the vaccine but then suddenly War breaks out in Ukraine and everyone suddenly said you know what no no no no the Press is definitely telling us the truth at that moment in time the Press was actually saying that Putin just didn't take his meds one day he woke up he didn't take his meds and he decided to invade Ukraine what a honestly stupid assessment that's what I was stupid and I came out early and I said nope there's a lot more of the story I was reading at that time Vladimir Putin's speeches where he was saying that NATO was the issue that data was expanding Eastward and he did not want NATO do that that would be essentially having an Army on his doorstep and we had had prior discussions all throughout the Cold War agreeing that we would never do that that we would never expand Eastward now whether or not that legitimizes his reason to invade next door that's a that's a conversation that we could debate but to pretend that it had nothing to do with NATO I mean how ridiculous how dishonest to not even enter NATO into the public discussion so I felt very Vindicated when the pope came out and he flat out said it was Pope Francis while talking to reporters a couple of months ago he said NATO is barking at Russia's doors he went on to say I can't say if Russia's anger was provoked but facilitated maybe yes makes people uncomfortable to tell the truth and I'll tell you why I asked you this question earlier which obviously is pertaining to the Ukraine and Russia conflict it's because we are neglecting an honest conversation about the plausibility that what is happening in that region could in fact Inspire World War III Russia is a nuclear power I had this on my mind because I saw a clip of Tulsi gabber discussing this with Joe Rogan take a listen we're at a point where the future is in our hands and what are we what are we willing to do I'm gonna ask you a difficult question what do you think is going to happen if we continue down this path that we have seen where we have seen this war continue to escalate since the invasion happened we will end up in World War III and a nuclear Holocaust if nothing else changes and we continue down this path this is where that path leads and it's not some far-flung possibility they're talking about this now it's very difficult for people to live in a world without nuclear war to live in a world where you get up your alarm clock goes off you go to work you drive the same way every day to imagine the eradication of all civility of all all the things all of our structure in terms of all of our just everything from all of our civil liberties to all of our roads and utilities being gone everything eradicated almost instantaneously yes and living in a lawless structureless Society where people are scrambling for food and dying of radiation poisoning if you're lucky if you're lucky because those are the lucky ones who survive who survive exactly and how long that radiation contamination lasts thousands of years it's it's an impossible scenario for people to put it in the radiation will last as long as Homo sapiens have existed which is wild that is a terrifying discussion but they are both correct we are neglecting a very serious discussion about what would happen in the event of a nuclear war which is entirely feasible In This Moment I mean think about just the history of nuclear threats the history of the Cold War right be prepared I mean now the preparations were completely ridiculous it's hard to imagine that they had school children squatting under desks that's what they did right they were squatting under desks an alarm goes off let's prepare there's nuclear threat get under your desk as if that's going to save you of course that wasn't going to save those kids if a nuke had been dropped it kind of reminds me of wear a mask save lives it's ridiculous government preparations that are meant to make you feel fearful and of course is not going to actually help you in this case we overly prepared for kovid right we foolishly prepared for covid the media was in lockstep making sure that you were terrified of a virus that had a virtual 99 survival rates think about that a 99 survival rate and you were not allowed to go to work you were told that you were had to get a vaccine if you wanted to go to work right you were told that your children needed to be masked at school children had a virtual 100 percent survival rate when it came to Cove it didn't matter lock step the propaganda campaign was made to make you feel fearful and to make you take certain action now we have this a nuclear war what would be the survival rate if a nuke was dropped right and nothing crickets from the Press they don't even want to talk about it no they just want to throw president zielinski and Vogue and put him on the cover they're trying to sell this conflict as glamorous to us don't worry about it look at president zielinski looking fashionable look at his wife they're in Vanity Fair they're talking to Forbes Magazine don't be fearful even though we are knocking on the doorsteps of a nuclear power it's completely sense senseless completely and utterly senseless that we're doing nothing when this is not an imaginary threat right covet was an imaginary threat this is a real one so my question is what is comforting you in this moment what are you placing your faith in that you're not even having this discussion about this plausibility I hope it's not in Western foreign policy because we've been nothing but antagonistic yes of course what is happening is that we are fighting a proxy war right and by the way it's not about winning our government we've already won they have already won the war because they're simply laundering money billions and billions of American taxpayers dollars is being laundered in that region right back to them I would bet in fact it was Julian Assange who was basically a prisoner of telling the truth that's what he did the WikiLeaks founder told the truth and he's had to hide from the American government since it was him that in 2011 warned us that every war is really just about dollars here's what he said because the goal is not to completely subjugate Afghanistan the goal is to use Afghanistan to wash money out of the tech spaces of the United States out of the tax basis of European countries through Afghanistan and back into the hands of a transnational Security office that is the goal I.E the goal is to have an endless war not more successful the goal is to have an endless war not a successful War he said do you think that's a conspiracy theory you think because your government just calls stuff conspiracy theories because they're media which is just their propaganda arm tells you it's a conspiracy theory that it's not true okay well let's take a look at this timeline ready on August 31st 2021 the United States ended the war in Afghanistan you remember Biden oh we need just need to get our our boys and our girls home we're not having any success in that region yeah kind of like we didn't have success in the Iraq War so what do we what are we doing right spreading democracy that's what they always say right so that was August 31st the very next day on September 1st 2021 the United States entered a strategic partnership agreement to support Ukraine's entry into NATO and the EU oh wow that's convenient just the day after well you know we're going to support Ukraine trying to enter NATO from October of 2021 to February of 2022 Russia began amassing their forces along the eastern Ukraine border the threats began to grow and then on February 22nd 2022 Jens sultanburg gave a speech regarding NATO projecting their power then finally of course you will recall on February 24 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine so these wars have been endless there's always just bit of War there's just we just have to accept that your tax dollars are going to be taken to go and support some effort some effort that you need to understand is necessary to quote unquote spread democracy doesn't that feel good spreading democracy except we never do it we never accomplish it never accomplish anything but stealing from you and I so what is comforting you in this moment because this is different right this is not Iraq this is not Afghanistan this is not some poor Middle Eastern nation this is Russia and they have nuclear arms are you comforted by the concept of mutually assured destruction yeah sure that's a political philosophy right we would all just kill each other so why would we do it why would we drop our nukes might be thinking Putin can't be that crazy right and okay sure there might be some Merit to that I I do believe that he is a calculator I think that he has probably understood that the Fallout from using nukes would be incalcuable so he wouldn't do it thus far he's actually only done a partial mobilization in the region and he has declined to call it a war actually calls it a special military operation but is that really where you want to place your faith in his sanity in mutually assured destruction when I think about it I come up with this I only have faith in this moment in the people first and foremost the American people I think that come November there's going to be a sea change in Congress following midterms we're going to put people into office that understand that what is happening is senseless to understand that what is happening is money laundering and there are so desperate to launder that money that they are putting all of our lives at risk I can say the same for European populations I place faith that the people there are going to realize they're going to look around and see rolling blackouts they're going to realize that they are facing an energy crisis because of the mistakes of their politicians I think that despite the ideologues in government saying ridiculous phrases as Liz trusted like Ukraine must win the war I'm sorry what Ukraine must win the war you're an absolute idiot I think despite those idiots the people have common sense that's all I have to say about that all right

expressvpn.com Candace okay now it's time for some topics to show [Music] so you know that I have spoken to you guys about how our culture is becoming desensitized to pornography now you can find that on one of my episodes we've talked about how really everything is born when you look around why not have a Congressional candidate that releases a sex tape then right because that's what's happening a New York Congressional candidate has released a tape of himself having sex on PornHub why because he wants to promote his sex positive agenda which includes the legalization of prostitution his name is Mike itkus and he is a third party liberal candidate of course he's a liberal candidate in New York's 12th District and a current major in the U.S Army Reserve he is running to unseat Jerry Nadler in November and he achieved ballot access in September one of his key campaign issues is you decriminalizing sex work so the promoter he decided the best way to do that would be to participate in an adult film and he posted that to Pornhub on his own account and it really is something first and foremost in the bio I just want to be clear I did not watch this I'm just telling you guys this is what has happened and the bio he describes himself as not married no kids not celibate and atheist emphasis on the atheist of course of course he has to be an atheist because he's also a narcissist he stars with Nicole sage in the x-rated clip which features the pair having sex on camera twice over the course of the past year the video is about 13 minutes long and it opens with the performer stage clarifying that she consents to the scene and is not under the influence of drugs or alcohol see that's why it's not a problem that they're having sex on camera and that he could potentially be in your government because she consents right it kiss then walks into the scene and clarifies the two have also been tested for STDs and they've established a safe word as well and that safe word is stop after the initial scene ends a video cuts to the pair again fully clothed and they have subtitled it Los Angeles California October 2021 before establishing consent again and going back to performing um a lot that I want to say about this I wish that we as a society could use our safe word stop when it comes to the grotesqueness of these politicians I don't know why people are becoming more and more extreme and it's hard to choose between who would be worse you know Jerry Nadler Humpty Dumpty Nadler I know name calling isn't nice but you'll recall what he did to me when I was in Congress he's a rude awful horrible individual or your other option is this guy who is now a porn star or because he wants you to understand that sex is so great that why aren't congressional candidates showing you how great sex Works can be sex work can be totally neglecting the truth about sex work which is that of course A lot of these individuals that partake in it do so because they are desperate totally neglecting the very high suicide rates of most porn actresses because they engage in this because they're desperate for cash and then when they get that cash they can't turn to any other career path because they're known as porn stars so he neglects that conversation and wants you to know that sex work is is real work right that's what they're saying all the time sex work is real work yeah it's of course a horrible horrible thing that has taken place and it really is of course a sign of the times so what's going to happen would you choose Jerry natal or you're going to choose this guy Mike it kiss we can keep an eye on that story the Democrats are just becoming disgusting another story that I wanted to bring to your attention because it it angers me a lot and it should anger you and I don't know how it works when there is an actual judge that should be put in prison but there is a judge that should be put in prison and he resides in North Carolina listen to the story a father of one spent 24 hours in jail because he refused to wear a mask as was ordered by a judge despite the fact that there is no state or County mandates in the place right so his name is Gregory Hahn he's 47 years old he's a U.S Navy veteran so someone that we should respect highly because he has served this country so he was among several of 98 jury duty candidates that was called to the Harnett County court and he showed up not wearing a mask because there were no such rules or warnings in place but despite the fact that masks are not required in the building judge Winston Charles who's just an activist Winston Charles Gilchrist he mandated that everyone in his courtroom must wear a mask because why not I'm a king I'm just going to make rules that don't exist right everybody hop on one foot I'm the judge do what I say there's no rules or laws to say you have to do this but do it and so Han did the right thing and refused the judge warned him that he would be held in contempt of court and could spend a month in jail if he didn't put a mask on but this guy's tough obviously right and he refused to back down he said that he told the judge I'm not going to wear a mask and the judge ordered 24 hours in Harnett County Jail Han told Tucker Carlson as he was recalling the 24 hours that he spent in prison that it was the worst 24 hours of his life he said he had to make a phone call to his minor child who was at home think about how horrible that is he said quote I got motioned and I got changed into an orange uniform I got a roll of toilet paper toothpaste towel grabbed a mat and I'm walking with inmates to a cell I never thought this could happen in this country Han added well let me tell you something it can't happen in this country we are seeing that we are treading towards people that believe that they are dictators right issuing mandates sweeping mandates I'm the governor and I've decided this is how I'm going to rule the states and it's by taking power away from you I know there's no law that says I can do this but who cares right the people are realizing that we as a society have been under duress because nobody is abiding by the Constitution anymore nobody is abiding by even laws that are put in place anymore this judge just decided to be a dictator in his courtroom and he made a person that he should have had the UT most respect for right individual that he should have said thank you for your service to nope he tortured him and made him spend 24 hours into prison because he didn't wear a mask and I guess masks work or whatever in his courtroom it's ridiculous and this judge should face consequences so I want to share that story with you so that we can become our own sort of activists and demand that that judge receives some sort of justice for these actions moving on you guys um I want to bring this letter to your attention actually my makeup artist sent it to me she is on Instagram and as you know there are companies that reach out to influencers and ask them to promote various things now usually you would expect as a makeup artist that they would ask her to promote well lipstick maybe it's the new mascara that's coming out maybe it's a new bronzer hey do you want to influence people to buy this bronzer all of that would be in the realm of something that would be understandable or something that I would expect but no actually what they asked her to do was influence people to get you got it another vaccine the email says hi Jessica hope you're doing well we have a new opportunity with the United States Department of Health and Human Services to promote their updated vaccine campaign and we think you could be a great fit if hired you'll receive a Paypal payment in exchange for one instagram in feed post and three stories click into the offer to see your rate if you're interested in learning more please check out the campaign details here campaigns entitled we can do this the updated vaccine campaign you can apply for consideration ASAP by clicking obviously yes we will let you know shortly if the brand chooses to partner with you on this project if you have any questions please respond directly to this email and let me know oh I have a question I have a question how is this legal I I the idea of influencing individuals to inject something into their body right this is a pro drug campaign and by the way a drug where now everybody's admitting it's not going to make you immune to Kobe we don't know what it does we do know for a fact that it can cause you to have menstrual issues we know for a fact that if you're a young man you it will cause you to have an increased rate of myocarditis right we know for a fact that suddenly a bunch of young people are having blood clots we have no idea why that's happening we have no idea why young healthy people that are in the prime of their lives are suddenly having blood clots throughout the their bodies thrombosis throughout their body so we do know for a fact that the vaccine comes with a warning of blood clots and yet people are being a approached by our government and given money to promote it anyways how responsible is that now do you understand why I say to keep your kids off of Instagram off of social media you can imagine the child that's going to see oh I follow these influencers and they're saying that vaccines are cool so I want it right to do drugs because it's cool off everybody that I follow is doing it so I'm just going to do it and suspend thought so I can fit in maybe I can post too that I got it done and be just like my favorite influencer this is sick this is what our tax dollars are going toward I again cannot comprehend how this is legal now that we know what we now know about these vaccines and which is something that we've always known which is that it's just been a propaganda campaign and yet the propaganda is allowed to continue this should be illegal moving on guys I want to cover the story of Kanye West he goes by yay now um he's acquired parlor which is incredibly exciting you guys know that my husband is the CEO of parlor so it's been very difficult for me to keep this a secret Parliament Technologies announced today that has entered into an agreement in principle to sell parlor the world's pioneering uncancelable Free Speech platform to yay the proposed acquisition will assure parlor a future role in creating an uncantidable ecosystem where all voices are welcome uh so what I want to say about this is first and foremost the conservative economy is added to the beginning I really do believe this I am an ambassador in every regard for anything that does not have leftists operating it is why I use my platform to tell you guys to cancel your PayPal account and how amazing that went right we saw how steep their stock dive was on Monday morning because we said enough is enough you're going to start penalizing us for quote unquote misinformation which means what the CDC and the vaccine police are going to put fact Checkers on us rather than completing we have to have actual Solutions and of course it's obvious why yay is now interested in acquiring a social media platform it's because he recognizes that his speech is being censored right that irrespective of whether or not you agree with him and his opinions do you agree the harder more difficult question is do you agree that he should not have a platform to speak do you agree when they say you should not be allowed to be on a podcast right do you agree that he should be canceled from his bank which she was canceled for his bank despite the left trying to spin it and tell you otherwise he received a letter I posted the letter it said following the conversation that they were ending their relationship with him not he was ending his relationship with them right so this is what's gonna have to take place is that we are going to have to stop complaining and start investing our time and our energy in creating an alternative right alternative platforms alternative banking you know that I have been very proud ambassador of glorified which is an alternative Solution financial services where they say it's okay if you're a conservative it's okay if you love The Second Amendment we believe in free speech the answer to individuals that want to control everything that we do is that we have to create Alternatives so this is exciting it's something to watch uh what you can expect what I can tell you is a a Rebrand obviously he is a Visionary uh he has is known and celebrated as a style icon so keep your eye on parlor which is now back by the way in the Google app Google Play store and they are back in the Apple Store after they were unceremoniously banned because of January 6th which may entirely no sense right they banned parlor parlor is spelled by the way p-a-r-l-e-r after January 6 and they claimed because they were inciting violence right which led to January 6 complete BS what they were concerned with was that they told Twitter and they told Facebook to take Donald Trump out they did that Donald Trump is not allowed on Twitter he's not allowed on Facebook despite the fact that during that moment he was the sitting president of the United States they canceled him anyway despite the fact that he never said a single word on Twitter or on Facebook that could be construed as inciting violence there was nothing violent about what he said they canceled him anyway then there was one app that had no connection to Twitter no connection to Facebook one app that was not left-leaning that was run by conservatives they were worried that Trump was going to get off of Twitter and go to parlor because it was the number one most downloaded app on that day people were just going we're leaving Twitter with trumpets what did they do they colluded and they knocked parlor out there's a crime what happened to parlor right and now what's going on well my husband got involved after January 6 and said how can we help because we were outraged by what happened you should have been outraged by the idea they can just tell you you're not allowed to be a part of our economy if we can't control you that's what happened you're not allowed to be a part of the economy you can't be in the App Store if we can't control you and what do they do they built the app back up and now yay has acquired it very interesting stuff all right guys moving on I think I have endured the most abuse I've ever endured in my entire life in the past week I I just I don't know everyone just attacking me from every angle there's just fake articles being planted every left right and Center I just I've never been under more media text than I had in the last week and of course it's because I dropped the BLM Doc and how dare you step on our toes Candace how dare you we've already agreed in the narrative George Floyd was a victim BLM is heroic for extracting tens of millions of dollars from people that felt guilty about the narrative that we made up out of thin air about policing in America has made it up and everyone bought it we made the celebrities put up black squares how dare Candace Owens come and clarify that we're all a bunch of liars and pigs actually that's what the media Main Street Media is it's a bunch of liars and pigs who are propagandists and who work at the behest of the government right they collude that's what they do and so I have been under attack and rather than draw attention to some of the more Sinister attacks I actually wanted to draw attention to something that was a little more light-hearted um I like Jason Whitlock uh he is another conservative commentator we invited him to the premiere and he watched it and somebody sent me this clip of him talking about what he both liked and didn't like about my documentary so take a listen there were some moments that that I thought were great that Shamika I'll bring you back in on this one when she went to Patrice culler's house and but they had already kind of shown this on social media but it was the way they unpacked it in the documentary I found it humorous I found it compelling I found it powerful but it was undercut by one thing again because she's basically making fun of Patrice Collins million dollar home or two million dollar home there's no black life I can't see any black life anywhere it was hilarious but I'm just telling you I'm watching it and other people are watching it and they're gonna be like well hold on Candace is there with two white dudes she she ain't brought no other than herself she ain't brought no black life to this neighborhood or to this movie and and it it again this is where I'm saying I think she needs some help the whole fact that she went to Patrice color's house in a car in a car service she's in the back seat she's got on diamond earrings she's dressed like she's going to go play bridge in that neighborhood with a bunch of white conservative women again I don't I'm not denigrating anybody but I'm just saying in turn if you want to really convey the message and hit it home there's just little small little subtle tweaks that you make that make your point more powerful and compelling which leaves me to my next question like is Candace was she the right messenger for this message [Music] okay again Jason I'm gonna send you some love here but I do have to comment back on this essentially your point is that I'm not ghetto enough to engage in this documentary this is a critique I get all the time like Candace speaks proper English and so people are not going to be able to connect with her as a what did you want me to what this is how I dress this is actually I don't have a stylist this is legitimately how I dress so you want me to pretend to be someone I'm not what throw on some uh Fresh Air Force Ones some old school FUBU put big Hoops that have my name in the middle and say yo yo yo up the gate it's not who I am right I made a documentary to expose the truth I'm not going to present a lie while trying to expose others for lying that doesn't make sense I'm not going to present a lie while presenting the truth I I I find a lot of difficulty with this entire concept that when black Americans look presentable they somehow can't connect that's the actually one of the problems I think in Black Culture and as a final two points to this you're talking about the fact that I showed up with my camera crew well yes they did happen to be white uh car service no we rented a car that could fit the camera crew obviously we were filming a documentary um but I don't live my life in the way that Patrice does I was pointing to the irony that this is a woman that is sitting supplanted in Beverly Hills or in what was it a Laurel Canyon in California and she says that she's terrified of white people something about white people that are around her I don't say I'm terrified of white people so what I do is I engage in a meritocracy the people that were the best people that needed behind the lens were behind the lens people that I felt were the best security members were the people that were the security members that were on site I hire people based on their Merit not based on their skin color I don't want us to engage in the same kind of racism that has become commonplace on the left lastly I don't know why people keep falling for this but these my friend are the diamond earrings that you're talking about Jason they're fake do you want these send me a note I will literally send them to you I remember Hawk news from black lives matter basically made the same arguments you made when he was on my show and he said look at you with your big diamond earrings and I offered that I said hawk if you want these earrings you can have them right now I think these cost like 50 bucks and they were from Nordstrom so if you want them Jason you can have them moving on to another story which makes me chuckle it honestly makes me laugh George Floyd's family is considering suing yay after the rapper claimed that Floyd was killed by a fentanyl overdose instead of police brutality the potential lawsuit was announced on Sunday in a tweet by civil rights activist and attorney Lee Merritt he said that Wes comments about Floyd's cause of death undermined his family I am interested in following that yes yay went onto a podcast and he spoke about my documentary so actually what he was saying is what he saw in the documentary we covered George Floyd's fictional levels at the time that he died we covered the fact that George Floyd uh was chewing up pills as he sat in the police cruiser right and that all of this evidence was found and so Kanye accurately pointed to the fact that a lot of what we were told was a complete and utter lie about George Floyd now the idea that his family would lawyer up it's amazing when you watch documentary it's amazing to discover his family didn't have time to go to George Floyd's home if he had lived in for the last five years he didn't have time to pay his bills that were left neglected the time that I made I in fact paid George Floyd's back rent I paid for his car to be removed these people had time to start all these Charities and to hire big lawyers but never cared enough to come claim his stuff post-def but of course they're making time to get essentially more money I would I would really be interested in seeing that lawsuit I stand by every single thing that I said in documentary and which yay clearly repeated which was that George Floyd had a ton of drugs in his system and you had somebody testify that had they had not seen the video of the police officer and seen other things then they would have concluded they died of an overdose yeah so um keep your eye on that story because that could get very very interesting that's all I have to say about that all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about the most popular app among kids and teens it's called be real have you heard of it and there are some very serious safety risks that you need to know about so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "6egm79IHAPk": "so I'm guessing you guys know this but the way that Geo targeting works is that wherever you are you are targeted with news and information regarding your surroundings so yes I got on a plane and went to London with my husband just so we could enjoy ourselves for a couple of days we haven't done that obviously now we have two kids it's been busy and it was the most relaxing weekend ever honestly just a perfect weekend but of course while I was in London I was getting news pertaining to whatever goes on in the UK even when you open your Twitter account it works according to their Trends nearby Trends in the area so I was completely ignorant of everything that happened in America for the last four days and it was wonderful it actually really allowed me to relax so I getting a plan to come back it's about a nine hour flight from London to Nashville I opened my phone I turn it on and I go to Instagram and I'm not even kidding I see this graphic and I am tagged in it from about a hundred people have tagged me in this graphic and it reads you have blood on your hands and the graphic is a photo of me Matt Walsh she actually looks great Ben Shapiro Marjorie Taylor green Laura Ingram Lauren bobert from Colorado and Tucker Carlson so I the first thing I did was I laughed because I just thought okay what did I do but these are these are my friends I guess why why what could all of us have done together to put blood on our hand it's such a it's also just funny because it's a ridiculous statement you have blown your hand it's just like I'm tired of people saying that give me something with a little more thought you have blood on your hands and also it reminded me and then I said to myself I shouldn't laugh it reminded me of that time where similarly I happened to be in London and I got a message from somebody saying that you need to respond to this and it was a trend that was happening with my name on Twitter as it always is saying that I had blood on my hands for if you guys remember this the Christ Church mosque shooting that took place in New Zealand I remember waking up and seeing this message and just going this is the most insane thing I've ever seen I tweeted something like LOL what and then the news cycle went crazy and it said Candace Owens laughs at the Christ Church shooting of course I wasn't laughing at the shooting it's horrific but it took place in New Zealand it happened at a mosque I live in America I don't even talk about Muslims or mosques it was just ridiculous that people were actually trying to attach me to this horrible tragedy all the way New Zealand and of course there are reasons for wanting to attach me to it was because there was allegedly a Manifesto and this Manifesto this insane individual put my name they also used Spyro of the Dragon which is a child's cartoon Sparrow of the dragon as a source of inspiration and this psychopath also included Nelson Mandela as a source of inspiration why not because we inspired him because he's a psychopath and of course we should not be adding legitimacy to a psychopath's claims that didn't stop the news people nope that didn't stop the journalists who just hate Candace Owens and want her to go away and thought this was a way to do it in fact it culminated into a moment months later when I was testifying on the hill regarding the rise of white supremacy and of course the Democrats have called three white people to testify on the rise of white supremacy Republicans had called me up and this woman she of course had a PhD because that's what happens you go to school for a long time and then you can't think anymore actually use the Christ Church mass shooting and try to insult me and say that I laughed at the massacre if you guys remember that her name was Dr Kathy Ballou and here's the moment I just have to say that I object strenuously to your use of the worst word hilarious um to me this feels a lot like your reaction to being named in one of these manifestos now you're of course not responsible for the words of somebody writing that document but I do think that laughing at it is a real problem because these are real families that are impacted by this violence and I think our efforts towards talking about this have to start from a place of mutual respect which is what I've heard from from the side of the table now the reason we don't have those numbers I want those numbers as much as you do but the number to say the numbers don't show something is simply not supported by the data you know that white supremacy and white nationalism is nowhere near ranks nowhere near the top of the issues that are facing Black America and the reason that you are bringing them up in this room is because it is attempt to make the election all about race as the Democrat not in my case if I'm not characterize Mr chairman it's my time it's my time you've got your time instrumental three more seconds every four years you bring up race and you knew exactly what I meant when I said hilarious and you just tried to do live what the media does all the time to Republicans to our president and to conservatives which you tried to manipulate what I said to fit your narrative okay I was not referring to the subject matter that is hilarious I said it's hilarious that we are sitting in this room today and I've got two doctors and a misses and nobody can give us real numbers that we can respond to so we can assess how big of a threat this is because you know that it is not as big of a threat as you are trying to make it out to be so you can manipulate and the audacity of you to bring up the Christ Church shooting Manifesto and make it seem as if I laughed at people that were slaughtered by a homicidal media Maniac is in my opinion absolutely despicable and I think that we should be above that to try to assign reality or any meaning to a homicide homicidal maniac writing a Manifesto which by the way let the record show also stated Spyro the Dragon the child's cartoon as a source of inspiration he also cited Nelson Mandela as a source of information I don't think I don't think that Nelson Mandela has inspired mosque shootings you can correct me if you think I'm wrong you would rather assign meaning to a homicidal maniac than to actually address that I said to the things that I said today that are actually harming Black America number one father absence number two the education system and the literacy rate illegal immigration ranks high abortion ranks high white supremacy and white nationalism if I had to make a list again of 100 things would not be on it this hearing in my opinion is a farce and it is ironic that you're sitting here and you're having three Caucasian people testify and tell you what their expertise are do I know my expertise are black in America I've been black in America my whole life all 30 years and I can tell you that you guys have done the exact same thing every four years ahead of an election cycle and it needs to stop so there you have it Dr Kathy Ballou effed around and found out very quickly I had no time for that no time for a woman who had no argument she had no statistics on white supremacy she just kept talking about how she felt because she's an expert on white supremacy she went to school she has a degree she has a PHD I'm a doctor on white supremacy whatever that means trying to sell to us that black people are at risk and she can't actually win on data in fact so she turns around and goes back to this moment of a Christ Church shooting in New Zealand at a mosque which I of course had nothing to do with and tries to extract emotion that way you laughed out of this no I didn't I didn't laugh at that I laughed at the absurdity that this is what the left does when tragedy takes place the absurdity of trying to connect a tragedy to the thoughts of conservatives sometimes overseas so of course I see this graphic right when I land right saying that I have blood on my hands it reminds me of that situation I'm thinking what could I have possibly done while I was in London with my husband what did I do with Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro and Tucker cross sin and I actually had to search for it as I said where does this even coming from what they were talking about of course was that recently you guys are probably following the story a gunman 22 year old gunman killed five people and injured 25 others at an lgbtq nightclub the club is called Club Q in Colorado Springs just before midnight on Saturday again I had missed that and so the left saw this and decided that the proper way to respond to it was to say that conservatives who have not supported the transgendered movement because we shouldn't right because absolute should not support giving puberty blockers to children because we're moral because we understand that ruining a child's body is satanic right but it's our fault that this tragedy happened because if only we had gotten on board with parents encouraging children to remove their genital Parts if only we had gotten on board with gender mutualized mutilation if only we had gotten on board with the side effects of drugs like Lupron that are being used to suppress puberty side effects that give young boys micro penises when they get older right that render these children sexually dysfunctional for the rest of their lives decisions that are being made by their parents not the children right ideas that are being seated in the classroom by teachers who are going along with this dangerous ideology if only we had gotten on board with that in a homicidal maniac would not have walked into Club Q in Colorado Springs to shop bunch of people but that's actually what they were trying to sell to us it's so sick and so Twisted you you almost can't even respond to it it's so insane basically the argument that they're making is if only you guys would allow mental illness to Prevail then mental illness wouldn't happen because obviously this individual who shot this club was a mentally ill individual and by the way there is no signs as of today and right now there are no signs this was motivated by his hatred of lgbtq people in fact more signs point to the fact that he is just a crazy person for example he was recently arrested in June of 2021 after a woman reported that her son how to threatened her with a homemade bomb multiple weapons and ammunition according to the press release from El Paso County Sheriff's Office so that individual who eventually shot up a club was already arrested because he had threatened his mother with a homemade bomb and multiple weapons ammunition in 2021 okay but that's not relevant of course I'm assuming that he didn't do this because his mother was lesbian or trans or gay probably because he's insane because he's a maniac and he should have of course been monitored because it takes an insane individual to threaten to blow up their own mom but no the left never misses an opportunity to score some points against the right even if those points are not being scored because we stand by our assessment that we need to protect children and what's happening to them in terms of the spread of the transgender agenda is wrong and of course Nancy Pelosi never misses an opportunity to try to dunk on conservatives and miss and she released a statement yesterday in honor of transgendered day of remembrance I'm just going to read you some parts of her statement she said as our nation marks transgender day of remembrance the house Democratic caucus Mourns the countless Americans stolen away by a scourge of transphobic violence a crisis that continues to disproportionately harm trans people of color that seems completely fictitious she went on and said that fight remains more urgent than ever as right-wing extremists Target transgender Americans most fundamental rights and freedoms whether spouting dangerous rhetoric from cable news desks or openly bullying school children from the halls of power Magna Republicans are cruelly undermining the safety and well-being of our transgender Community horrified by such Shameless bigotry house Democrats are proud to March alongside our trans friends neighbors and siblings as we work to uphold Justice and dignity for all she went on to say heartbroken for so many beautiful souls murdered by hate and guided by Relentless activities across the country let us renew our resolve to build a future that our children deserve I can't even I don't have the words to describe how positively twisted and maniacal that statement is I don't have the words describe it the idea that you are trying to sell to people that if only we had harmed more children right if only the mega Republicans could just get over this need to protect children's innocence if only you would allow us perverted and sick individuals to teach children that they can rent themselves of their gender that they can just become somebody else if they agree to have a bunch of cosmetic procedures right if they agree to mutilate their own body if only Maga Republicans would allow this this shooting wouldn't have happened transgender people would be safer she says safer we know that's fact factually incorrect because we know that the suicide rates of transgender individuals go up after they transition not before that's the LIE they keep telling us right it's because they're struggling and they don't know their identity if only you allow them tradition they'll be happier they'll be free or no winds up happening is they don't know what they're doing because there's a society and sick twisted individuals like Nancy Pelosi that are encouraging them to go down a very dark path that they cannot turn around from and they go through with procedures and they realize that far from what they were taught in classrooms these procedures are not reversible whatsoever of course you're going to have lifelong effects you cannot just skip puberty it's on a YouTube video you don't just press pause on your puberty and think that everything's going to be fine afterwards and when they are met with that reality when they are met and faced with reality that actually they were abused these children are being abused by adults who are allowing them to form these demented thoughts that are encouraging the demented thoughts of children people that we should fight to protect every day of Our Lives then they become suicidal then they say I don't want to live anymore because I'm never going to have a life that is full I'm never going to be able to have a normal natural family because I was lied to as a child that's what's happening and the idea that you think we're going to shut up about that that you would stand behind dead innocent people in order to further your sick causes again I have no words you guys are monsters alright guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde's breakup who's surprised and my updated theory about the Idaho murders so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in

was amazing it just feels good to get out of America I wasn't following the news cycle it was nice we even left the kids behind we felt like we were kids again it was wonderful and then I touched down back in Tennessee I turned my phone on and the first thing that I saw was a graphic that said that I have blood on my hands that I Candace Owens have blood on my hands so the question of the day today is what did I do to have blood on my hands again yeah you're gonna want to hear about that plus San Francisco launches guaranteed income programs for transgendered people and the application provides for over 130 gender sexuality and pronoun options and encourages enrollees to check all that apply yep sounds about right for San Francisco all that and more today on Candice Owens [Music] thank you

eyes and imagine that you live in San Francisco I'm just kidding don't do that that would be a nightmare it's Monday don't just do that that's a bad activity I'm sorry that I even imply that you should do that but if you are some individuals that are still clinging on that maybe San Francisco is going to turn around you shouldn't do that you should pick up your stuff and you should leave and start your life somewhere else because they are just I don't know I don't know what they're doing I don't even know what they're experimenting with anymore but they have now launched a guaranteed income program for transgendered people it's amazing how much effort is being made for transgender individuals I showed you guys my BLM documentary the greatest lie ever sold that so much money is being funneled to support these transgendered projects namely also trying to experiment with building the first ever transgendered neighborhood in San Francisco so that is a fact and now they have decided that they are that they just have to give them money just for being transgendered so the guaranteed income program application provides for over 130 gender sexuality and pronoun options and it encourages enrollees to check all that imply because you might not just be one you could be 20 of them the program is gift it's called gift guaranteed income for transgendered people and it will provide 55 economically economically marginalized transgendered people who have a monthly income of less than six hundred dollars with twelve hundred dollars per month for a year and a half imagine that so some of the pronoun options on the application include Zim zis fee Fair fairs and Tay tarters so if you are our teachers or a Tay or turkers you can go on to this and you could you could fill out this application and yes it is being done by the transgendered district and they want to help you out there to give you twelve hundred dollars a month and my favorite option of all the gender options by the way I didn't even know this was a gender but there's one that's called gender f gender and that is an identity of gender that is that you basically I'm gonna try to explain to you so you're a gender if you like the idea of playing with gender cues to purposely confuse stereotypical gender Expressions usually through clothing so I don't know maybe that means like I don't know Harry Styles I guess would be considered a gender and that's an actual real option so if he wants to receive 200 a month in San Francisco he just has to tick that box and say hey I like to just wear dresses sometimes and play with gender cue to purposely confuse stereotypes and gender expression of course they also have two Spirits which I just do not care to figure out what that means and you can also choose between sexual orientations like BDSM and kink again where is money coming to fund the transgender district and which is producing these applications it came from BLM this is where the money went a ton of money went to the transgender District who are now sponsoring this application process so if you really cared about police shootings against black men I hope you equally care about the Caesar Zim's Tater hers take the Tater turters that is what is happening all right guys another story and this was really breaking news it was the first thing that I heard when I was coming back from London Trump is back on Twitter this is amazing I was so happy to learn about this that Elon Musk has reinstated Donald Trump's Twitter account namely because uh Donald Trump never tweeted anything violent it is just a made-up narrative people pretended that he tweeted on January 6 March to the Capitol and burn it it never happened right they just decided to shut down his Twitter account and his Facebook account on January 6 because I guess just him existing encourages violence and it just begged a question what is freedom of speech how are you penalizing somebody for something that did not happen on your platform at all how what is the process here there was no process and Elon Musk understood this and he reinstated Donald Trump's account he also reinstated which I am equally maybe even more excited about project Veritas you know we are are good friends with James James O'Keefe over at project Veritas they are doing real investigative journalism the government hates them because they are investigating the government they pointed out the lies that were being told during the covet scams they pointed out the lies of the vaccine manufacturers and their ideas that this vaccine is totally safe and effective and because of that they have been banned from the Twitter platform again never inside any violence they just incited people to take a look at their own government and realize that crimes are being committed and that wasn't allowed under a Jack Dorsey Twitter I guess Elon Musk we would say to them and predictably people had meltdown about this in fact the best part is that this came about because Elon Musk did a poll instead should Trump be reinstated and the majority of people felt that he should be reinstated I think it was 54 of people said yes to it and Sam Harris as just one person who was having a meltdown over this uh tweeted this in response he tweeted Elon Musk if you do bring him back you shouldn't please have a terms of service that covers the deliberate spreading of dangerous lies and then apply it he will be off again within a week the deliberate spreading of dangerous lies is just spoken like an absolute leftist and he wasn't done because then Trump obviously got reinstated and Sam Harris said this he said the prevailing opinion among quote-unquote Free Speech absolutist appears to be that this platform in order to become healthy must helplessly publish the malicious lies of any Maniac at scale regardless of the consequences good luck with that such a pretentious tweet from Sam Harris why do I like Sam Harris well a little story if you want to go back in a time machine to 2020 I think it was 2020 when the cold covered stuff happened I instantly knew it was a scam I knew the government was lying I was the most vocal outspoken person with the platform against the coveted lie and I tweeted I don't know what it was I tweeted but Sam Harris hit back I said that well I said eventually we're going to realize I'm paraphrasing myself here that kovid was a lie and Sam Paris tweeted back and said your tweets are going to get people killed and then Dave Rubin who's a mutual friend of us both reached out to me and said please just get on the phone with Sam Harris he's a good guy I don't want you know two of my friends warring you know he tried to play Switzerland in this and so I honored my friendship with Dave Rubin by getting on the phone with Sam Harris and I will never forget the conversation he calls me up and he sounded like he was in a bunker he sounded actually like he had taken his children and his wife down into a bunker with whatever was needed to survive and he said to me you don't understand and he used the fact that of course what they always do well these academics know absolutely nothing but what they read in books they do they do not possess critical thinking skills at all and he said I know doctors and Physicians over in Italy this thing is going to hit America in two weeks there's going to be Gurney's on the street there's going to be gurneys on the street because there's going to be no room in the hospital you don't understand this thing is real he was speaking to me like the Bubonic plague was about to hit America and I was just very calm and respectful I was in the car on my way to an event obviously I was not locking myself at home I was in Texas my husband was next to me and I was just making faces like oh this guy sounds a little cray-cray he has definitely sipped in the Kool-Aid and I just said okay thank you and they start running rattling off some statistics and trying to under make me understand how viruses work because he's got a degree from Stanford University how consume Heroes be wrong and of course hung up the phone said to my husband he's completely out of his mind crazy that man is not coming out from under that Buckner for months to speak and I went inside did an event shook everybody's hand and did not get coveted until years after that and I survived it never had a vaccine never did anything turns out I was right Sam Harris was wrong but in a Sam Harris type universe I would have had my account suspended for spreading malicious lies because how could I possibly know anything when the experts and the academics are telling us the opposite they read books guys they understand the data they own the science right that's the whole point you spend enough time in school you become an idiot I say it every time he's got a PhD from Stanford which lets me know that he is somebody that believes in his own magic right he believes that he's super educated as these leftists tend to be I'm a journalist so I I am a responsible purveyor of information citizen journalists don't understand we should tell you what's right and what's wrong and in a world where you disallowed other opinions and by the way my expert it was kind of like what I said when I was on the hill I said my expert was being black in America my expertise on the coveted stuff was experience I was going and I was doing my event still I was shaking hands I wasn't wearing a mask I had my family over nobody was dying using anecdotal experience to debunk the idea I mean six feet apart I mean how completely asinine was that works it's why we should have open in communication and we should say I understand what the experts are saying but here's what I am seeing and experiencing in my life oh okay I have covered and it felt like just a very light cold guys but no no no they wanted you believe that it was a Bubonic plague they wanted us all to get on our knees to close our businesses to impoverish our families and Sam Harris by that very metric should have been taken off of Twitter because he spread that dangerous and malicious misinformation makes me happy that these people who were broken by Trump's existence are still unhappy and upset and here you know what Sam you could just leave Twitter that's an option if it's so dangerous why don't you just get off a bit how about that okay I want to take a second to talk to you guys about good ranchers in case you didn't know beef prices are expected to rise another 15 in 2023. today's high prices will seem

moving on you guys gotta cover my girl Meghan Markle you know I love her now I just I'm leaning into her victimhood I think it's great I love her I think her podcast where she talks about how she's a victim every day is amazing and I think it's amazing now that she's even winning awards for being a victim I think that's what's what we need more of in society more victimhood and tears and even if you're a princess and you're dripping in Saudi Arabian diamonds on your wedding day you too can be a victim and that is what I have learned from Meghan Markle well now Prince Harry Meghan Markle are going to receive a prestigious human rights award for calling out the structural racism within the Royal household now you're wondering what structure of racism that was basically Megan restructured racism to be anytime she didn't get what she wanted it was racism so like right now by Meghan Markle and I'm like hey I want a hundred thousand dollar raise daily wire and they're like hey no I just go racism that was structural racism I'd say liar because I was told no and so that's why I learned Meghan Markle and that's why I'm really happy that she is receiving this award it's the Robert F Kennedy human rights award because of her courage to stand up within their Royal Institution and call out that racism Carrie Kennedy is the president of Robert F Kennedy's human rights Center a non-profit that gives out an array of awards to individuals for their transformative work in the pursuit of a more just and peaceful world blah blah blah everything's kindergarten how are you feeling are you happy here's an award here's participation trophy we don't know what you've done Harry and Megan at all in this world except show us how you can make millions of dollars talking trash about your family non-stop but we'd now like to award you for doing absolutely nothing and we know that they'll be there because there isn't a red carpet event that Meghan Markle would ever miss that girl loves a camera the problem of course is that she's a d-list actress and no one's buying her stick anymore and Harry looks pretty pathetic constantly talking trash about his own family so we always wonder how long we can keep up the charade and I'm always proven that they can just keep on keeping on love my girl Meghan Markle that's all I have to say about that if you follow me on Instagram you

preferred order okay now it's time for my daily comment Roundup let's Jump Right In first and foremost we had a comment from Holly and she says hi Candace I absolutely enjoy watching your videos I'm a Muslim living in the west and just wanted to let you know that Sharia law isn't as gruesome as the media portrays firstly Sharia law is a comprehensive code of living for Muslims that upholds universally accepted ethical behavior for example giving charity respecting your parents being kind to your neighbor Etc and also prohibit traditionally recognized immoral Behavior such as adultery usury alcohol consumption robbery murder of innocent people and much more furthermore the law provides guidance for daily life for daily life pardon such as what is permissible to eat how to eat how to pray the part of sharia law that gains most attention are the punishment laws which are undoubtedly severe but for reasons as your friend explained the severity deters people from committing the crime and is comparable to the death sentence so she's saying that comment because I covered the re-emergence of sharia law in Afghanistan and I just shared with you guys again not offensive Sharia law whatsoever that I did know that there were Muslim people who don't think it's that bad and that there are people that say that it actually creates a more peaceful society that the opposite would be San Francisco where there's no rules and so what's worth a society that's more dangerous or society that punishes there are criminals more harshly again that was just fodder for people to think through without taking a stance on it and we do need to stop however believing that because we are in America we understand entirely how other people should feel about the societies that they live in the laws that they abide their lives by we have I just think we have to stop doing that in the west there just seems to be this arrogance and going well everyone wants us to march in and free them and that's not always circumstance some people are happy living in the way that they live and I knew this because I knew someone who was excited about their Barca excited that they were going to one day be able to wear a burqa as this sign of Honor for her father and her husband and so it just makes me realize that we don't know everything in the west even though I very much appreciate the way that we live our lives out here so more food for thought another comment regarding zelenski you know I did a couple of monologues with him last week because I don't like him Julia D writes I'm polish and it effing breaks my heart when I see what zelenski is doing we have so many Ukrainian refugees in Poland now they get so much money from our government they act like the biggest a-holes they think that they can have everything they want and they actually get it Poland is a poor country and now it's even poorer Polish people don't even get a third of what Ukrainian people get so lemski is destroying my country together with our crappy president and corrupt government thank you Candace for telling the truth I'm a huge fan of yours you are the only person that from the beginning knew what was happening everyone called me a Russian Troll and because I knew what was happening I hope this BS finally ends but we all know that it won't there you go speaking of other takes from people inside of countries we just assume that every person in Poland is on board and wants ukrainians refugees into their country and is is buying the Western narrative that zielinski needs more money and more Aid and that they should just open up their countries to a bunch of people that are fleeing and that's not the case people's lives are being impacted and yeah there have been a few stories about some Ukrainian refugees I think most notably that story of the woman who moved into somebody's house in the UK and then very quickly began sleeping with that woman's husband and she tore apart her marriage and she was a Ukrainian Refugee I mean you could only imagine what that woman is going through she reads some articles Ukrainian refugees needs your help and she opens her house to a Ukrainian Refugee and the Ukrainian Refugee begins to sleep with her husband and break up her marriage now of course I do not mean to suggest that Ukraine refugees are all bad people and they're sticking their hands out that's completely wrong and fictitious and but there is a Nuance the situation where we should be allowed to have a more informed discussion of course polish citizen should not be called Russian trolls for saying that their lives are being negatively impacted by the refugee crisis that's happening over their borders and so again I'm all about just hearing everybody's side and things and I really don't like when there's censorship and we're being told that this is the only narrative that we must accept which is seems has been the case in terms of Ukraine and Russia next comment is regarding Casey Anthony Don says I'm not saying Casey Anthony is or is not guilty I can make note that years ago I saw video footage of her and her parents on a jailhouse call and was very triggered by their Dynamic and the way they interacted in someone who has had a lifetime experience of a narcissist family Dynamic emotional abuse physical abuse manipulation minimization dismissiveness gas lines name a few and back then their Dynamic kicked me in the gut I have nothing more than that to go on but it left me questioning If the parents are hiding their abusive nature they shaped Casey for how she has developed and that there's more to the story I have learned to trust my gut since getting out of the brainwashing of the narcissistic family cult something is off I do not doubt that Casey Anthony came from an abusive household abusive household there are tons of them I did not doubt that her parents are not wonderful human beings I wouldn't doubt any part part of that if that was a presentation but I also feel in my soul that Casey Anthony waiting 30 some days to call the police when her child was missing is all we need to know about that particular case now these are two different things there are people that like to explore what you know motivates someone to do something horrible and drastic and to kill somebody right and people who like Netflix did in terms of Jeffrey Dahmer wants you to understand the mind of a serial killer and there probably is some tale that leads people to be crazy there always is and it usually does come from within their own households but it still does not in my opinion make Casey Anthony an innocent individual and we will never really know what happened and I guess I have to say that she is legally Innocent but my gut is just that she potentially got away with murder next comment is regarding the thread that we brought to the Forefront about people that are de-transitioning and calling the trans Community a cult most people are correct Toro 190 right yep I just left the cult and throughout the Kool-Aid was half transitioning for two years and honestly I was lazy as hell I didn't even come up with pronouns and barely even told anyone except my doctor then when I was like nah this isn't for me I like being male I got so much backlash from trans people the gays and straights have been very supportive in my choices and understand that it's a whole con job yeah of course because the trans Community if people if gay people and lesbian people were smart they would kick that perverse narrative right out of the club they would kick it out we're talking about child abuse this is not about sexual desires this is about people that are experimenting on children and creating Franken children is what's really going on and of course it will take time for people to stare that in the face and call that demon what it is and call that Satanic ritual what it is and it's why it's important for me to use my platform to do just that but you don't want to be on that side you are not going to be want to be on the side of standing with transitioning children when that hammer drops because that hammer is in fact going to drop do you owe back Texas to the IRS do you have unfiled returns now is the time to take action the so-called inflation reduction Act is funding 80 billion dollars to the IRS allowing the government to weaponize the IRS by hiring 87 000 more agents will boost tax collections against the American people like we've never seen before tax Network USA is an

yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "C9jhMIMP-Co": "okay guys question of the day are false flag attacks just a conspiracy theory you know you hear this all the time oh this is probably a government-sponsored false flag is that sort of like totally Alex Jonesy or is there some merits to those sorts of claims plus we're going to talk about a woman who married a rag doll and claims that their relationship is hanging on the thread after he cheated on her by texting another woman oh no all that and more today on Candice Owens [Music] foreign so I was in equal parts amazed and somewhat confused by the comments beneath the monologue that I did a couple of days ago regarding MK Ultra you know the CIA program that they allege has been suspended but kind of the proof in the air is that it wasn't suspended when the CIA was just openly drugging citizens that were unsuspecting of being drugged by LSD because they were interested in mind control and I was fascinated by the comments because a lot of you first and foremost didn't even know about it so I was just going how is it possible I thought this is to me almost mainstream information some of you guys a lot of you also said I it is so courageous that Candace is speaking out and talking about this the mainstream never talks about stuff like this and that was confusing to me I thought that this was something that everybody knew and then I started to realize I asked a few people here at the daily wire if they knew about MK Ultra and one person said it no the first time they heard about it was when I spoke about it and I realized wow wow there is actually a deficit of information of course I mean one acts aspect of MK Ultra that we discussed was the fact that the CIA had invaded even college campuses right that they were funding College groups and so of course it would make sense that there was a relationship between our government and universities we know that they are funded federally but also they're going to make sure that what children are learning what students are learning is something that supports the state narrative that of course makes perfect sense right and so it would also follow that they're not going to want students to learn about government corruption of course you don't want students learning in a class about the classroom setting about how the CIA and the FBI have been involved in all sorts of horrible things against their own people every decade that's why it's amazing to me that people place so much faith in the Department of Justice I always ask the question give me one decade give me just a few years where there wasn't some Scandal that has been revealed about the CIA or the FBI now a lot of you were very concerned for me which also caught me off guard think oh my gosh Candace this is really dangerous stuff that you're talking about well guys I wasn't exactly reading from a dark website I wasn't down a rabbit hole I was the documents that I had on my desk when talking about MK Ultra it was from history.com you know the History Channel History channel.com or whatever it is it was just I thought mainstream information but I'm now realizing that a lot of mainstream conservatives avoid these topics because they're fearful of being called I don't know what a conspiracy theorist and by the way there's an entire conspiracy behind that even the term conspiracy theorist allegedly came from the intelligent communities and it was so supposed to sort of ward off the scent if you're on their Trail Oh They'll call you a tin foil hat even when you are holding the Declassified documents from the CIA themselves the idea is making oh okay who cares you're crazy we said we stopped that program look the other way and so I'm thinking about this because obviously we recently also discussed zelenski this incredible Act of pretending he had no idea that it was Ukraine that fired the missiles that landed and killed two polish Farmers he pretended he had no idea and he called for NATO and the entire world to stand up essentially zelenski cult for World War III and my instant analysis was that he attempted almost a false flag attack Fair absolutely fair you're going to try to convince me the other thing which is that he had no idea that his men launched the missiles he had no idea what he decided to do video after video calling on everybody in lockstep to come help and and calling it an act of Terror from the Russians of course he knew that what he was saying was a lie or else there's somebody else that's in control of the Ukrainian military and making those calls of course she knew he was lying and so yes I do feel that an element of this was meant to be sort of a soft false flag that was supposed to inspire people to give NATO the permission to respond to Russia fully now the concept of a false flag attack now that I'm I've said that in a past episode I realize even that concept to people seems a little conspiratorial like why would you ever suggest that governments would be colluding to lie and to even potentially kill their own civilians or the civilians of others just to what effectively drum up public support right it's a propagandist effort to drum up public support and to say this horrific thing happened and now you all must acquiesce to the idea that we must go to war well that is something that we know is true we know for a fact that at the very least our governments have discussed it and tried to sign off on it in the 1960s they wanted to impart a bunch of false flag attacks against the American civilians because they wanted to drum up support across the American population against Fidel Castro so I'm going to tell you about another CIA operation again this is mainstream information you can Google this in your spare time I feel like that sets the bar you can Google or you can Wikipedia this so that should let you know that it's really present information that they just don't want discussed another operation at the CIA wanted to have taken place was called operation North Woods operation Northwoods was a proposed false flag operation against American citizens that originated within the United States Department of Defense United States government wanted this to take place in 1962 so that is when this was proposed the proposals called for CIA operatives to both stage and actually commit acts of violent terrorism against the American Military and civilian targets blaming them on the Cuban government and using it to justify a war against Cuba the possibilities detailed in the document included the remote control of civilian aircraft which would be secretly repainted as United States Air Force planes they also play with the possibility of the assassination of Cuban immigrants sinking the boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas also toyed with the idea of blowing up a United States ship and orchestrating terrorism in United States cities why didn't this take place because the proposals were rejected by President John F Kennedy if you want to know how that ends he was killed we don't know why but he did reject these proposals to take place in the to take apart to play a part in these false flag operations the backstory is Fidel Castro had taken power in Cuba in 1959 and began allowing Communists into the new Cuban government nationalizing United States businesses and improving relations with the Soviet Union which of course was a huge concern the 1960s the cold war is what we're talking about and so this was sort of capitalism versus communism that took place and to that end operation Northwoods proposals recommended hijackings and bombings followed by the introduction of phony evidence that would implicate the Cuban government it stated these are actually Declassified documents they say that the desired result from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere why don't worry about you again because I think that's really really relevant right this is from their documents the desired result from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere okay several other proposals that were included within the operation Northwoods included real or simulated actions against various United States military and civilian targets the operation recommended developing a communist Cuban Terror campaign in the Miami area in other Florida cities and even in Washington which involved the bombing of Civilian targets themselves which was to be blamed on the quote-unquote irresponsible Cuban government to paint a false image of Fidel Castro and misinform the American public you should know that you should know about operation Northwoods because as I said this is available all you have to do is Google this this is not a conspiracy theory being woven by Candace but I felt that it was necessary to present this to you so that when I start to talk about things like what happened with zelinsky and I say that seems like a false flag you know that I'm not just saying that because I'm in conspiracy lands because I understand what our government is capable of and I know that if it wasn't for The Bravery of then President John F Kennedy who rejected these proposals who knows what would have happened would we have possibly uh Gone move removed the Cold War gone from a cold war to an actual War to actual combat because the American people would have been deluded by their mainstream media into believing the propaganda believing that we were actually attacked from Fidel Castro when in fact we were being attacked from the United States government that's a very scary thing to consider that they wanted this implemented and just so you know the plan was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and it was signed by chairman Lyman lemnitzer and it was sent to the Secretary of Defense like I said it was authorized by The Joint chief of staff and it would have gone through if it was not rejected by President Kennedy so tether yourself to that reality when you are being told that horrific things are happening and tragedies are happening overseas the reason why I really wanted to paint the idea they wanted to have Fidel Castro who obviously was not a great person so please do not take this as any defense of Fidel Castro absolutely not he had outrageous things to Cuban citizens which tends to happen in communist countries but the idea that they wanted to intentionally paint him as rash and as irresponsible I didn't like that when I considered what would have happened if we had believed zielinski's narrative is intentional lie of a narrative about Russians striking Poland it was so crazy of course the conclusion across the media had that lie not have been stopped in his tracks would have been that Putin was so rash and so irresponsible that even though he was using this war he was fighting this war in Ukraine and losing it he then was just going to throw some missiles over into Poland and just try to fight this war on or on on all fronts it's a very scary thing and it's why we have to get very real in discussing what is going on in that region and the only way that we can get real is if we tether ourselves to the reality that what is given to us via the mainstream media is intentional it is at the direction of the CIA many times we talked about operation Mockingbird earlier this week we know that they have that we have CIA journalists that are acting the place they have huge followings and we also learned earlier this week from a person that was in the CIA that they would intentionally leak bad information to well-meaning journalists it's important that you know all of that so that you have an appropriate relationship with the information that is being given to you by the Legacy Media and that's all that I will say about that all right guys I want to take a moment to talk to you about Black

covid is still going on you know for like the state the state is still pretending that covet is a thing because obviously they've taken trillions of dollars of taxpayer dollars and laundered it in some capacity so they of course go out to the state-run propagandists operation Mockingbird people and they tell them hey don't forget about covid even though clearly people don't care about it anymore people now realize it was a scam we have to play the part as if it's still a concern everyone's in a blue moon just sprinkle in a little covid magic and of course we could hardly talk about state-run propagandas without speaking of Our Ladies over at the view who are promoting the third booster the third booster says I mean four in total yeah four shots in total in case you lost count or if you're like me and didn't get any so it wasn't relevant here they are reminding you guys to get your third booster unfortunately Whoopi is out with covid so rest up and get back here miss when you feel better it's coming back it's coming back another friend of mine got it too I mean we have to be careful again and it's interesting because a lot of people aren't getting that new booster with a different variety I got more that one is I I got it a couple months ago and I did get a reaction to it but it made me is everybody eligible for now we have to yes in New York no everyone yeah clap if you had your third booster it's worth it you gotta love that clap if you've had your third booster okay clap if you had zero coveted shots yay go Candace I don't know how I'm still alive by the way it's a Bubonic plague and somehow I survived it kept hanging out with my family never wore them out I don't know how I did it I almost just have just an incredibly strong immune system or something or we were all lied to and scammed and they're trying to keep it up by the way I love that home chick makes the comment quietly she's like I kind of had a little bit of a reaction they just keep talking over her because you're not about to say that there was ever a reaction to covid shots no no it is safe and it is effective we don't know what it is effective at exactly we they we just keep adding booster shots and we don't know what it's effective against because Whoopi has once he is once again out with covid and she's had her boosters so you would think that this story doesn't make sense for them you would think they would say maybe we shouldn't be promoting the vaccine right after we tell them that the person who's been triple quadruplebacks is out again with covid but now these ladies don't think too hard they're doing their part sponsored by Pfizer I believe that was a a true thing during the covid lockdowns we learned that Pfizer was giving money to a ton of journalists so that's what I mean when I say state run journalism now what's incredible by the way is that the White House is keeping up this charade that's not the incredible part but when they post these sort of reminders on Instagram to get your booster or to get your vaccine the comments you guys they are incredible go pursue them go actually read the comments every time the White House posts anything I mean it's a bunch of people telling them to f off that they'll never get another shot that they lied calling them scam artists I mean the comments are essentially 99.9 of people telling the White House and bauchi and everyone and Pfizer that they're a bunch of frauds and the point one percent of people that disagree are on The View so there you go so the world is crazier than ever you know

America Chuck Schumer another crazy person who unfortunately has a bit of power he has recently come out and said that our American population is not reproducing like it used to I wonder why but don't worry guys he has a solution to it and that solution is immigration we just need to legalize more illegal immigrants take a listen now more than ever we're short of workers uh we have a population that is not reproducing it on its own with the same level that it used to the only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants the dreamers and all of them because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here I really have nothing left to say here other than Democratic Leadership they seem to be Satan worshipers to me I can't even respond to that you're saying you're correctly identifying a problem that our society is not reproducing and why is that well I don't know maybe because from the time that we get into school women are being told not to have children not to Aspire to family you're giving them a bunch of birth control pills you don't really know what the result of all these pills are micro dosing all of these women for years women are struggling to even get pregnant because a lot of these things that you don't even allow us to talk about then you couple that with the fact that you have children that are being corruption that they can pick their gender and encouraging them to when they turn their whole ripe age of 18 to go ahead and just remove their genitals because it'll somehow render them male or female of course these kids then realize that that's a lie and that they have been actually dosing themselves with hormones that make it impossible for them to actually reverse anything that's happened to their bodies they don't get to grow up and become we have reproductive families of course because their bodies are destroyed before they are even old enough to be able to reproduce and then you add that to the climate change stuff you keep telling kids they're going to die it would be irresponsible for them to have children and now you're surprised that some of them are making that decision when they're adults not to actually have children all of this to say that the answer to the problem of us not reproducing isn't that we need to start telling people the truth and start making family more aspirational isn't that we need to stop funding groups like black lives matter who put into their Theses that they want to destroy the nuclear family unit isn't that we need to stop people Mass learning the mass learning that's taking place on University campuses the indoctrination rather not the learning which is telling them women that they need to climb the corporate ladder and not aspire to family no it's none of that the answer according to Democrats is that we just need more illegal immigration and we need to just give people citizenship and then hope that maybe they'll produce or something like that you people are sick moving on you guys um there is a journalist who you guys might recognize you covered in the other week his name is Miguel amagur and he notoriously did a very real report of how strange the Nancy Pelosi story was now mind you this guy was on NBC news so he is on the left he was definitely not trying to take down Nancy Pelosi he was just being an interested journalist and God forbid you work for NBC and you get interested about anything other than the narrative that is being provided for you and the narrative that has been provided that they are in lockstep agreeing is that Paul Pelosi just don't even think about his DUI I don't even ask the question who was in the car with him during his DUI don't even ask any questions about how this person got into his house and why he was so calm when he opened the door for police why he was also sounding calm on the phone there are so many holes in the story that if you're a journalist of course a real journalist and you're not a hack you're going to be interested in the story and you're going to say hmm you know we're kind of waiting for more information well Miguel made that mistake over at NBC News he tried to do a little journalism okay he said this is a weird story and I'm being told that Paul Pelosi calmly opened the door isn't that kind of a weird thing and well guys he has been suspended rest in peace Miguel gosh he just should have known that he can't do this the today he's also a Today Show correspondent and he's been suspended by the network for his conduct because they ended up retracting that story of him attempting some journalism and they essentially said that the story was erroneous and they don't they can't really explain why it was erroneous they said the peace should not have aired because it did not meet NBC news reporting standards that I believe I know your news reporting containers or do not report the news at all so actually do believe that that was a legitimate reason to suspend him because he tried to do report some news and they essentially said that in the actual police report it said that Pelosi nervously but calmly greeted the officers and when this guy did his report he said that he calmly greeted the officers but he forgot to add that he was nervous so that kind of allows them to say maybe you know Paul didn't really know what was going on and he was super scared anyways this guy is losing his job for what I would say all the right reasons moving on you guys there in case you didn't know I think I told this a few times in the show but you cannot search the term White lives matter on Tick Tock you just can't do that because that's racist but one thing that's great about Tick Tock is that if you're black and you're openly a black supremacist you can put out whatever you want because hatred toward white people is totally fine in 2022 especially on social media they condone the behave able to encourage the behavior and there is a young woman who it describes herself as a black supremacist and she has made an appearance on Tick Tock in which she spoke at what is being alleged to be her father's funeral it's very clear that she is at the very least talking about a dead man who is her father and she basically gives a speech saying that he's a bigot and who cares if he's dead and this is the eulogy that she gave to her father at his own funeral take a listen but Dad please know that while I'm graceful and highly aware of all that you give in this family I still don't miss you when you died I felt like there was a hole I missed something but it wasn't you it was the idea of what you could become I missed being able to Hope and wish that one day you turn the corner and see the world from my perspective I missed the idea that one day you might help me fight for the things that matter I missed my fantasy of you because when you died it solidified the fact that she'll never be what you could have been but only what you are and what you are is a racist misogynistic xenophobic trump-loving sister white man that is all you will ever be to me and Dad before you tell me to respect the dead please remember that you disrespected and disregarded the lies and death as an entire Humanities of people with your ideology you told me to Never back down so I won't you know for a fact that even against you I'm not afraid to share my peace you are everything I Aspire not to be and I refuse to stand up here and sing the Praises of a man who was the Paradigm of white supremacy so I'll take your racist mindset I'll take your money and I'll take your advice and I swear to God I will make this world a better place not at all because of you but an exact opposition to you yikes he didn't hear much of an Applause following that because awkward man I bet you could hear a pin drop after that it's so dark and it's so twisted and what's very apparent to me is that she probably thinks she's having a Maya Angelou moment she's probably thinking that she's incredibly Brave and she's written out this poetry and people are going to jump up and they're going to applaud her and no that isn't the circumstance because I don't care what your perspectives are I don't care how much you hate Donald Trump this level of trump derangement syndrome is heartbreaking and it's disturbing that she's nothing but an ideologue she's I love at the End by the way she says I'll take your money yeah we know we know you'll take his money that's tends to be how it goes you know you go off to a university you learn some ideas your parents are still supporting you you actually have to start a life on your own but you're convinced that you have ideas that are unique perspective is when in fact you've just been implanted into your head so far so far into your head and into your mind that you are standing up at your father's funeral and you are saying disgusting awful horrific things about them so I think what's sad about the internet is it's forever and of course eventually her brain will mature and she will live to regret this moment or she will have to in order to rinse herself with the guilt go even further are into her delusions and trying to justify her behavior I mean I couldn't imagine I would not be able to stomach if I went to school or I knew this person at all I would just think they were the most horrible individual I mean I don't care who they support the idea of doing this when your father is dead and in the ground and thinking that this is a moment of Bravery is so indicative of the many things that are wrong with American culture today and the many things that are wrong with Tick Tock as I always say to you which encourages people to do more and more extreme things for likes and what better and more extreme thing to do for likes than to insult your own dead father in a PO like in a poetry slam in front of an auditorium filled with people that are likely mourning his death total and absolute sicko moving on guys another topic of sick people I guess is what I would say a woman has married a rag doll and she claims that their relationship by the way is hanging on by a thread perhaps the pun intended there after he cheated on her by texting another woman so yep this woman married the rag doll and she is from Brazil she's 37 years old I can't really say her name Maddie vone marivone Roca morayas and she hit the headlines earlier this year after reviewing that she had met the love of her life a rag doll and she's admitted that the relationship is not doing too well because of this cheating and it's obviously a very bizarre tale she claims that she caught him cheating when he went to a motel with another woman and she even found the text messages on his phone so I mean as a woman I feel sad for her I couldn't imagine if the ragdoll um I think the inanimate object of the rag doll that was in my house and was my husband then I he went to the motel room with another woman and I feel that I would feel sad I feel sad because I can't imagine walking into the motel room and seeing the doll that I bought not on no way not with another woman no not my clock well that's what happened to this girl and it's very very sad and she was overjoyed of course when they first met each other and she was in love with him that's what she says but then she started to have doubts about their relationship because she is the only breadwinner and they were struggling to pay bills so I mean I am just feeling even more bad for this young woman I just I mean it just it sucks imagine not even like you you give him everything you're paying for the electricity you're paying for the water and then all of a sudden you realize um something's getting a little weird and you go to a motel room and there's the Ragdoll texting other women I just like I don't know I want to have this this woman on my show I think that I should have her on a topic of taboo my monthly series I think I should sit down and talk with her and I should talk to her about this incredible betrayal and guys this is going to shock you but you can hear more about these tales on her Tick Tock ah there it is again tick tock it's a network of mentally disordered individuals the kind that Mary ragdolls the kind that think they have 37 genders the kind of individuals that eulogize their fathers and say horrible things about them all for likes and attention I'm gonna wrap this up in the same way that I wrap up every story when it comes to tick tock get your kids off of that social media app or you will suffer the consequences it's like sending them to University okay that's already probably a bad idea but sitting in the University with a tick tock like forget it you're just not gonna get your kid back so you should not do that and that's all I have to say about that all right so if you're listening to this show odds are that you put a lot of stock into how you raise your kids you understand that your children look to you to Define their values and their perspectives of the world that's why it's extremely important that you have a will in place my husband and I have a will of course we sat down years ago and had a discussion about who we would trust to raise our kids in the event that something happened to us we were very very careful to choose somebody who aligns with our values if you're just starting out and you don't have thousands of dollars to spend on an attorney but you want to make

your thoughts starting with this woman Ashley is writing to me on the topic of black women being mean to one another and she says Candace you're so great I'm a black woman and can I just say that you're out here speaking truth black women and men are so colorist it's insane and they are the most judgmental people ever I am with a white man and me and my dad had the biggest discussion because he said that he will never forget what white people did to our people and I tell him what about what our people do to our people black men have made me feel insecure because I'm not tall because I'm tall and not thick in the hips like they prefer no one in the black community Growing Up made me feel beautiful or desired and my dad is so caught up in the narrative why are so many black women dating white men being black and speaking truth will make you become a Target just know that you're doing a great job and I'm watching and becoming more empowered and wearing my natural straight hair with confidence because of you this girl keeps speaking the truth I will keep praying for you that's a very kind comment and you're so right though I didn't even bring it up when we had this discussion about the vicious nastiness about the fact that I'm married to a white man it's so bizarre to me it's so crazy because here you have a group of people you know a subset of black American culture that are basically insist missing that racism is everywhere except for where it very properly is which is implanted in the black community right so what do you want did you not want Virginia versus love the Supreme Court case that allowed blacks and whites to marry do you think that's a bad thing do you want us to just marry black men and just have white men marry white people would that be a good thing do you actually want to go back to the time to segregation there's no thought giving to what they're fighting for right they they say oh it's it's betrayal it's betrayal for a black woman to marry a white man okay then it works the other way then you believe that it is an act of betrayal for a white person to marry a black individual what does that say to you would imagine if a white person if when Kim Kardashian was married to yay or a better example there is the actress Jody Turner Smith who's married to Joshua Jackson imagine if the comments coming from the white Community to Joshua Jackson was you're betraying your white race why would you marry that black woman you guys would be outraged you would call it racism and yet you do it all the time the other way and it needs to stop it's just flat out racist it doesn't impact me at all I'm very happily married but I should speak out on it because it's happening to a lot of people who are impacted by it and it's hateful and it's hurtful so I appreciate your comment and I am glad that you support me next comment is regarding Madonna who we cover all the time she's having a mental breakdown in slow motion someone needs to help her Randy Morgan says I used to work at Coachella Fest every year one year Madonna was DJing one of the tents she would not perform until she got her Kabbalah water so all the streets were cleared for her truck to come through when it arrived with her water the problem was that the other 70 000 people that were dying of thirst in way over 110 degree weather had to wait for water coming in for them until her special water got to her she was not invited back why like um definitely could believe that I think like I said and I've said before is that she is suffering from a case of nobody has told her no in a very long time this happens when people achieve a certain amount of status in life is that they people that are around them are either a fans or B just a bunch of yes men who want to keep their job and they say yes yes yes yes yes and sometimes you have to tell somebody no I don't care how rich you are I don't care how influential you are you're being low-key disrespectful and I'm not going to tolerate that anymore and Madonna would never suffer that so I imagine that she just continually keeps a bunch of yes men around her even if a bunch of people are suffering outside while she gets her Kabbalah Water by the way what is that what is Kabbalah water it's a bigger question that we're not going to get to today another comment regarding Madonna from Nita Hamlin Nita says my friend was hanging in studios in New York with Madonna eating french fries from the bags in the trash back before she made it she was sweet and down to earth back then certainly not who she is today maybe someone should remind her where she came from she is now the epitome of how not to grow old I'm embarrassed for her that she doesn't have the ability to be herself it is sad that so many are suffering sudden adult death syndrome yet hardly anyone is saying the truth about it out loud as to why this might be amazing how Madonna gets more attention than young Health people dropping dead for no apparent reason I won't ever be a tick tocker yeah Tick Tock sucks uh and you are correct that part of the problem is I just keep covering her I probably shouldn't cover her all the time but I just can't it's irresistible to me it's irresistible that this woman is so clearly having a mental breakdown and so apart from reality and I like to assess her as a cultural item because because you are correct she does epitomize what you should never become and why it's so important for you to find traditional venues of happiness because the non-traditional routes that they're trying to sell to you as being cool it's suffering we're watching somebody suffer and and that is the truth and we should never glorify these people so it's important to routinely talk about them next comment is regarding girls that film themselves crying on Tick Tock this is known as spoonies on Tick Tock you can get attention if you just cry and it works like this like maybe you have a feeling coming up and you're like I'm really sad right now then you grab your device you race your device you hold the tear you find your Tick Tock app and you open it and you cry and you put a caption it says just being the real me Candace today the real me but also put a filter on it so that you look like the real fake you or the fake real you that's it that's what's going on Tick Tock people are crazy anyways this person comments this is Christy H she says these girls simultaneously break my heart and infuriate me mostly the latter I think I battled with and I say battled with because it became a very real addiction serious self injury for almost 15 years throughout my teens and 20s it makes me it makes me feel in control yeah sure until the time I slipped up and almost bled to death then spent three months in the hospital on an involuntary commitment I'm 44 years old and all thanks be to God I have not cut myself for over 10 years now but I think about it all the time and God knows I can never forget it because my arms look like they've been through a meat grinder but definitely girls go ahead and celebrate celebrate yourself for taking backpack control you're so brave you inspire me humility and wisdom are critically endangered virtues I should just make it clear that she's saying like you're so brave you inspire me XOXO in quotation mark she's mocking obviously the commentary that follows this where people actually say these girls you're so brave for crying you're so brave providing a community and talking about how you cut yourself for relief it is a very scary thing these girls are not getting the productive feedback that they need which to tell them that they need to actually seek help and to transform their lives and all of this is happening because Tick Tock is an absolute disaster of a social media app keep your kids off it final comments this is to me regarding my thoughts on Trump being angry I told you that I just think he needs a pivot and be less angry and people are very upset about me saying that I think he's more likable when he's having fun and not when he's angry AJ says honestly I don't blame Trump for being angry there's only so much punching that someone can take he is only human and we all have a breaking point I do think that we all need to stick together as conservatives because I think that the conservatives are going to be the ones that will save our constitution I don't think we should be allowing The Psychotic left to divide us and push wedges between us because then they would win I agree with that it didn't mean as a form to separate people I obviously am very conservative I've been a trump supporter for a very long time a vocal Trump supporter and I've had to deal with tons of bullets for being that and I I just think that he's it's how could you blame him for being angry of course he's angry I would be angry he wakes up in the morning and he has to be in full fight mode at all times but he needs to at least direct that anger to the right places and not direct you towards people that are his allies and that's all I'm going to say about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus as you guys know I can answer your questions but I only do it on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on Nick Canon's many many children so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "b3YJ24roIzk": "hello and welcome and we can just get right into this because you know what we we are going to cover today we obviously have to cover the george floyd trial conclusion which is that derek chauvin is guilty on all counts and i have to appreciate people that were trying to create a pressure campaign for me on twitter saying i wonder what candace is going to say even republicans agreed that this was the right call i don't care who agrees that this was the right i don't care if it's a republican i don't care if it's a democrat i don't care if it's a white person i don't care if it's a black person i am not so much of an intellectual coward that because the mob decides something because the lie about george floyd and the way that he lived his life has become so big that we just have to now accept it as the truth and believe me this is a lie nancy pelosi yesterday said quote thank you george floyd for sacrificing your life for justice she also said quote that his name will always be synonymous with justice george floyd's name will always be synonymous with justice you have got to be kidding me don't tell me doesn't matter it does matter this is the most important part that he is now becoming synonymous with justice let me remind you guys i've done it before right when the media was spinning all the lies and the media first came out and they said oh george floyd was just getting his life together he moved to minnesota he got released from prison in 2014 he was just getting his life together you remember that do you guys remember that media depiction of saint george who was just doing things for kids and just loved the kids and really was trying to set a good example and was just getting his life together until i reminded people of what his actual record was because it became apparent to me that there was a reason that they were not producing the police footage because they wanted to make sure that the lie was perpetuated around the world and repeated over and over again before the truth could get up from bed and put its shoes on and here is the truth here is the person whose life and whose name is now synonymous with justice nancy pelosi george floyd has a rap sheet and i'm going to remind you guys of it again today he was arrested for delivery of a controlled substance he was arrested and put into jail he was arrested for theft he was arrested for theft again he spent 10 months and 10 days in jail he was arrested for failure to identify he spent 15 days in jail he was again arrested for possession of a controlled substance less than one gram of cocaine he was then arrested for trespassing no forcible entry he was arrested for delivery of a controlled substance he was arrested for possession with intent to manufacture or distribute another 30 months in jail total he was arrested for aggravate aggravated robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon and that has really got to be the most significant arrest for me because of how sick what he did was ready here's a statement at this time a black ford explorer pulled up in front of the complainant's residence the complaint that we're talking about the woman had somebody knock on her door and say that they were from the water department and then that person forced their way into her home and then a ford explorer pulled up and there were five other black males that exited this vehicle and proceeded to the front door the largest of these suspects forced his way into the residence this is george floyd forced his way into the residence placed a pistol against the complainant's abdomen and forced her into the living room area of the residence the large suspect then proceeded to search the residence while another armed suspect guarded the complainant who was struck in the head and side areas by the second armed suspect with his pistol after she screamed for help i should also mention that there was a toddler in the residence at the time that this happened a toddler that was traumatized by what george floyd did a woman who was traumatized by what george floyd did various people who were traumatized throughout the life of george floyd he left a wake of victims that is what happened he had so many victims throughout his life but right now the world has decided that he is just a wonderful human being not allowed to talk about his record not a lot talk about any of things there are children that are running around with george floyd church there are murals that have been constructed dedicated to george floyd because his name has now become synonymous with justice i guess my question is justice for who how do i do that how do i live a life so that people say candace owens's name is synonymous for justice it's not telling the truth people hate that people say you're not allowed to say it you're not allowed to talk about who this person actually was because the media has agreed on a narrative before the truth has gotten out about who this man was getting his life together is anybody still buying that anymore oh no never mind it actually turns out that at the time of his arrest he had fentanyl in his system he also had methamphetamine in his system we also learned that the week prior he had had an overdose but none of that matters because now we live under mob rule mob rule just says that if a black man dies and a white person is around while that black person dies it is a racially motivated crime they've never proved that nothing about this was about race at all but it doesn't matter because now george floyd has been propped up and this is what we have to agree on nobody's allowed to tell the truth why are they doing this why can't we honestly have an assessment and come to an agreement by the way i would have been perfectly comfortable people said derek chauvin was guilty of manslaughter i'm comfortable with that charge i'm not comfortable with the lies that have been told repeatedly about who this man was if you care about black lives if you're watching a sneaking candace i just care about black lives then why can't we discuss black criminality at the same time because usually on the other end of black criminality is a black victim that was the case with jacob blake that was the case over and over again with george floyd that's also the case with and let's talk about the person that was trending all last night and all this morning makaya bryant is that her name the woman the the young woman that they're now saying is 16 year old girl in columbus ohio who was shot on tuesday by police did you guys see the clip of of her mother er she was shot and killed by police because she was attempting to stab another girl it's on camera she was a knife wielding maniac but those details don't matter don't forget because her mother came out and said that micaiah had a motherly nature about her she promoted peace kya bryant's mother wants you to know that the knife-wielding maniac that you saw is not who she really was maybe in that moment she was trying to kill somebody but the point that we should be focused on is that micaiah bryant like to promote peace in her spare time right i mean this is like i feel like we have now tapped in to fiction now we have to just accept fiction it doesn't matter because makaya bryant was black and she died at the hands of a police officer and that's all that matters now people want to come out and they want to support micaiah bryant maybe she too like george floyd will be buried into a gold casket maybe eventually one day nancy pelosi will say that micaiah bryant's name will be synonymous synonymous with justice let me tell you what is actually happening in america at this time if you're a black american you better pay attention right now in america the goal is to make sure that black people love and support criminality that is the goal the express goal now is to make black people believe that we should be in the streets rioting and looting and demanding justice for criminals right because that is what these people are they're criminals george floyd was in the process of committing a crime i'm not saying he deserved to die i don't think anybody deserved to die i think he deserved to be arrested they attempted to arrest him did you forget that part have you seen the full video of his arrest the media refuses to show the full video that shows the police tried to put him into the vehicle multiple times and he resisted arrest by saying i'm claustrophobic i'm claustrophobic because he had just ingested fentanyl fentanyl that thing that's a hundred times more potent than morphine he had just ingested it because he didn't want to again get caught with a controlled substance as he had done repeatedly throughout his life let's ignore the testimony from his girlfriend who said that they were both addicted which by the way that is sad drug addiction is sad we can be talking about drug addiction we should be talking about drug addiction that would be a meaningful discussion but instead let's ignore all of these things that would help us fix black america let's let's not talk about drug abuse let's not talk about drug dealers let's not talk about criminality let's not talk about why micaiah bryant had a knife and was trying to stab a woman to death let's just talk about black victimhood because the discussion about black victimhood almost guarantees us that in the future black neighborhoods are only going to get worse when you start celebrating criminals that is of course what is going to be the end result we're going to have more black death we're going to produce more black failures because we're not allowed to talk about the truth anymore and republican democrats are even saying that this is good right so let's not talk about it it's just been agreed the lie has been agreed upon don't say anything if you tell the truth canis you're a bad person i don't care what i am called just because right now in this country we are facing a pandemic of cowardice because people are too scared once the mob says that this is what must be said and these are the only things that can be said because the media has now created a system a successful system of propaganda where people don't even know what the truth is because the lie has been said over and over and over again that does not mean that i'm going to back down to the truth in fact i think more than ever now we need to have people that are willing to stand up and to say that what is happening in this country is wrong what is happening in this country is backwards none of these people that i mentioned are heroes thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new videos

back to the media matters organization media matters for those of you that are not aware is george soros's media arm and they dedicate journalists to the task of watching every single minute of

minions watch every minute waiting for him to say something wrong i've never been important enough to earn myself a dedicated media matters team but last week's episode of candace changed the game minutes after it premiered a clip of me started going viral on the internet ladies and gentlemen i am honored to announce that finally i am important enough so please give me a round of applause thank you thank you now of course every article these hacks right is mean-spirited and that's putting it lightly they go after people who uncover a truth that they don't want the public to become aware of just yet and so they instead re-route the public's attention by creating outrage over something else it's your standard look over here strategy last week i might have been shocked and quite possibly even personally devastated and hurt by their attempt to paint me as a russian propagandist who doesn't think ukrainian people have a right to exist or not for the fact that this just is not my first rodeo when it comes to the press for example i was one of the people who the media henchmen accused of supporting rape culture they said i wanted women to be sexually assaulted back when i declared that i did not support the hashtag me two or times up movements both of which seem to me to be politically expedient you'll recall that this was around the time that hillary clinton was running for president and suddenly the obsessive mainstream narrative became women have been under duress for far too long and so time's up millions of dollars was raised overnight to support that thesis just seemed a little shady to me and they said i was wrong until they said that i was right until this headline time's up charity set up by celebrities as part of me too movement spent 1.4 million on salaries including 157k on conferences at luxury resorts yeah then i was right i was also accused by the press of defending the institution of white supremacy during the summer of black lives matter riots another timely media narrative surrounding the death of career criminal george floyd i pointed out once again that nobody knew where the billions of dollars which was being raised virtually overnight was going it appeared to me to be another election time money laundering scheme at the very least it was clear that a single red scent was being routed to actual black american communities we were just the you know emotional bait empty your pockets to help these struggling people another political mugging in fact from where i was standing it looked to me that the black neighborhoods were being destroyed and black criminals were being emboldened but saying so made me a white supremacist until yeah you know the press now is slowly and very quietly admitting that i was right check out these recent headlines california doj targets a leaderless blm global network for missing tax documents orders group to stop accepting donations here's another headline progressive activist that was a blm activist a 2020 bostonian of the year arrested on federal charges of fraud and conspiracy yep so like i said not my first rodeo being smeared and then vindicated years later but a paid russian propagandist ouchie that hurts my feelings reminds me of that time that i shared contents from hunter biden's laptop two years ago and i had my twitter account frozen because of it and i was accused of spreading russian disinformation now of course they're ready to admit that no it wasn't actually russian disinformation at all it was actually all true and yes a crackhead walked into a computer shop and forgot his laptop of course they knew it was true from the very beginning but they didn't want the public to know at that time so anyone who reported on it was smeared as a russian puppet what did i say this time i mean what truth did i happen to land upon last week that our media is attempting to divert traffic away from i've got to guess i think it might be the very questionable past pertaining to ukrainians president zielenski and his link to hunter biden and the biden family investments in ukraine that might be a relevant thing that the press should be discussing no the media is insisting that we get involved in an overseas war that is taking place in precisely the same country that the sitting president of the united states has his family assets in currently our media wants us to believe that zielinski is the real life batman surviving multiple assassination attempts daily in a city under siege with no wi-fi access or running water but also able to somehow make time to do at least 10 media hits per day plus present to our congress in front of what appears to be a green screen okay whatever sure so zelensky is the new george floyd is the new dr fauci hero now send your money and ask no further questions or else be accused of wanting ukrainians genocided except i have further questions i always do and asking those further questions has landed me in hot water with the reputable new york times over the weekend i received this email from them they said they were working on a story which would feature me of course about quote russian messaging that includes some of your comments we note that you would advance the idea that ukraine was a corrupt country which matched comments we've seen from russian state media end quote i was rather shocked by this email me advancing ideas from the russian state media so i wrote back to this reporter in earnest informing him that i was quote very confused by this email i learned about the idea that ukraine was a corrupt country from the new york times you guys have covered the corruption of ukraine extensively for years as just one example here is a piece from the new york times editorial board entitled ukraine's unyielding corruption end quote i also followed up with several more links from the new york times and the washington post which spelled out my ideas that president zielenski is a corrupt member of the global elite those are the washington post words by the way global elite not mine it talks about his offshore accounts which were controlled by oligarchs the reporter thanked me for shoring up all of those articles but there's a piece of me that thinks that he might have died a little bit on the inside when he received my response here's the truth that the media wants buried because as we know the mainstream media works for the government and the government needs its citizens ignorant in order to advance its causes the truth is that wars are money laundering operations whether it's a multi-generational war on poverty or a going-on three-year war against kovid or a 20-year war in afghanistan wars represent opportunities for governments to siphon away trillions of dollars from taxpayers to countries which are willing to launder that money and divert it back to corporations the truth is that the money that they siphon from our good will and our fear is always somehow unaccountable the truth is that president zielenski at least according to the western press a couple of years ago is controlled by a man named igor kolomoisky the ukrainian man who funded zelinski's television show back when he was an actor and who subsequently funded his campaign into power in ukraine it might also be relevant that igor kolomoisky has a controlling interest in charisma the energy company at the root of hunter biden's laptop scandal it is also true that igor funded the oz of battalion the according to western press at least neo-nazi white supremacist militia that has been terrorizing ukrainian citizens now as a matter of opinion i believe our government is interested in liberating ukrainians like i believe that the black lives matter riots were about liberating black americans which is to say not at all this war is about the same thing that every war is about money corporate greed masquerading as some other noble cause i believe there are no good sides in this war not the kremlin or the ukrainian government and certainly not the western governments either and as a result ukrainian citizens today are legitimately suffering and we should pray for them just as russian citizens are legitimately suffering today and we should also pray for them but what i cannot and i refuse to endorse is another money laundering operation from the war

have to speak the truth I was gaslighted to the point I was second guessing my own idea I've already paid the price for telling the truth all along my career like why hide this one money didn't mean when 150 000 people getting bombed and you can't speak about it", "6avTu6_yEtU": "all right guys question of the day today should I sue George Floyd's family kind of thinking that it should for emotional distress plus later on we'll be talking about the BBC because they've apparently prepared secret scripts that could be read on air if energy shortages cause blackouts or the loss of gas supplies this winter hmm all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] so the greatest lie ever sold that is the title of my Smash Hit documentary it's all anybody seems to be talking about these days online if you haven't seen it make sure you go so that you understand why it's causing such a headache for so many people people are angry how dare we they had decided on the narrative already remember George Floyd is a hero Derek Chauvin is a monster how dare anybody have the audacity to go backward and to re-examine what happened in this country during the riots during looting now personally I think that I deserve an Emmy Award I don't know something a Pulitzer a Nickelodeon award anything I don't know if it's gonna happen because I'm recognizing that instead what the media is trying to do is to double and to Triple down on their lies so my friend yay you know the artist formerly known as Kanye West went on drink champs this is a podcast the funny thing is I was supposed to go with him but I couldn't because um my young son got sick that morning and so I did not go down there and what has happened is he began because yay went and spoke about the documentary he spoke openly basically he was giving a critique of a documentary a positive one a review if you will and he told the truth about the levels of fentanyl that were found in George Floyd's autopsy he told the truth because he watched the documentary he told the truth because he was at the premiere and like many people who have seen the documentary he is upset with how we were lied to how Black America in particular was lied to so because of this Roxy Washington that is the mother of George Floyd's daughter so George Floyd mama she has retained the services of a law firm in preparation to file a 250 million dollar lawsuit against yay for the comments that he made about George Floyd's death wow that is incredible imagine going on air and telling everybody about a documentary that you watched a documentary that is completely factual a documentary that had experts documentary that used excerpts from The Trial itself and you decide that your grift just must keep on grifting oh my gosh no no no I'm just gonna file a lawsuit against yay in case you didn't know this guys yay has already given that family two million dollars yes because perhaps he even believed that it was a racist event that Derek shovin did this because he hated black men and now some clarity has been provided and he is trying to extend that Clarity on a podcast to people who maybe have not seen the documentary yet so let's first take a listen to yay's actual statements that he made on drink Champs I watched the George Floyd documentary that Candace Owens Put up one of the things that his two roommates said was they want a tall guy like me they want a tall guy like me and the day when he died he said a prayer for you know eight minutes he said a prayer for eight minutes they hit him with the Fentanyl if you look the guy's knee wasn't even on his neck like that when he said mama mama is his girlfriend they said he screamed for his mama mama was his girlfriend it's in the documentary so I would like to first again impress upon you that yay has already given this family two million dollars what do they do with that two million dollars and the other millions and millions of dollars that came flooding in for them uh nobody knows I know what they didn't do for documentary shows they didn't uh go to George Floyd's house and pick up the stuff they allowed his car to rot in the driveway they didn't go visit the roommates or his the last place that he lived for the five years preceding his death they didn't care about any of that they did get in front of cameras and cry they did get in front of cameras and talk about oh how much they loved him the roommates which is it a clip that we actually didn't air uh told us that they had never even seen any of these family members they'd never seen anybody they saw on air talking about how much they loved him it was the roommates that actually spent the most time with him for the last five years of his life so it was interesting it's an interesting it's compelling Story how um how honest are they being in their expression of their emotions of how close they were and how much they loved George Floyd himself I don't know we left that up to interpretation after the documentary but here's what we know and what we stand by We Stand by the truth regarding the levels of fentanyl that were in George Floyd's body we're gonna give you a clip an excerpt from a documentary itself take a listen they had to have the jury believe that it was a neck restraint it was the knee on the neck it was asphyxiation that killed George Floyd however there was a ton of evidence that George Floyd consumed a toxic lethal cocktail of Fentanyl and methamphetamine did it appear that Mr Floyd said I ate too many drugs yes it did let's put it in perspective three grains of fentanyl on the head of a lead pencil enough to kill you enough to kill me and so they had to continuously inculcate the public to believe that Derek chovin intentionally premeditatedly murdered George Floyd and drugs had absolutely nothing to do with it as as Lindsay and the toxicologists presented that awful testimony do you recall describing the level of fentanyl as a fatal level of fentanyl I recall describing it in other circumstances it would be a fatal level yes in other Circumstances had Mr Floyd been home alone in his locked residence with no evidence of trauma and the only autopsy finding was that fentanyl level then yes I would certify as death as due to fentanyl toxicity foreign [Music] so our documentary also shows that George Floyd said I can't breathe before he was ever put onto the ground it also shows that he himself asked to be put on the ground so essentially everything that we were sold the greatest lie ever sold to be at the media was a lie right we were led to believe that he was placed on the ground and unnecessarily restrained against his will why couldn't this have just been a peaceful arrest well the answer to that is because he resisted arrest he kept resisting arrest they kept asking him what was wrong with him he didn't mention to them that he was actually sitting in the car when they arrived with his drug dealer we also go to show you that there were chewed there was a chewed up pill that was found in the police cruiser that tested positive for Floyd's DNA tested positive for fentanyl so what do you think that George Floyd was doing with his drug dealer sitting in a car when he also dropped a chewed up fentanyl pill what do you think that George Floyd was doing in that car I'll leave it up to you I don't know if we're all gonna pretend to be stupid let's let's just leave it to the audience what was he possibly just having a conversation with this drug dealer who refused to testify because he wanted to recuse himself because he had other pending charges that might implicate him I think they were just hanging out talking about the game it is such an insult a continued insult to the Public's intelligence that we have dropped an actual factual documentary to reveal the truth and in response to us telling the truth they've decided to Triple down on the LIE the media is behind us without question the media is behind trying to make people believe that there's anything actionable in this lawsuit against gay in fact the lawsuit is such crap I'm going to read you what what it actually says ready it says this is a demand letter that is written to Kanye West as Mr West we are contacting you regarding your recent statements in reference to George Floyd and his manner of death our office represents Mr Floyd's minor child and her mother as you can expect our clients are very distressed and hurt by the allegations that you made Mr Floyd's cause of death is well settled through evidence presented in courts in the courts of law during the criminal and civil trials that were those were the results of his untimely and horrific death okay um we presented evidence from the trial the evidence from The Trial that never made to the mainstream media so it's completely ridiculous that you're pretending that this documentary doesn't have two legs to stand on uh what you're actually upset on is that you are understanding that you are losing control of the narrative as you should lose control of the narrative because as we also revealed the 80 million dollars that was raised on the back of the public believing that George Floyd was ruthlessly murdered by a police officer and this lie was orchestrated by intentionally extracting meaningful portions of the trial yet none of that money actually went to help Black America itself did not go to the inner city communities they are completely rotten today right we showed the increase in criminality and the increase in Murder in the City of Minneapolis itself so what they're doing is they are once again and they are standing behind George Floyd's minor child to do this they are once again trying to get ahead of the public demanding answers right the public should demand answers a lot of money was stolen on the back of the slide is theft to take money to report that you are doing it to further black lives and to do no such thing as what was done with black lives matter now the second portion of this obviously which they're upset about is the fact that Kanye said that he wasn't even on his neck like that all right let's take another listen to my documentary from the perspective of Miss Frazier's camera appears that officer chauvin's knee is on the neck of Mr Floyd yes would you agree that from the perspective of officer King's body camera it appears that officer chauvin's knee was more on Mr Floyd's shoulder blade yes yes that is the chief of the Minneapolis Police Department saying that from the video he was watching as he is sitting in trial he realizes that from the police body cam footage it looks that it looks as though Derek Chauvin is actually kneeling on his back shoulder blade and the footage from darnella Frazier's cell phone showed from the front not from the back so that's important Kanye told the truth he told you what he saw in the documentary he's essentially providing you a review and yet despite this this demand letter went out and is asking that yay refrain from publishing or causing to be published any other audio video statement any posts regarding George Floyd his estate his family and the circumstances surrounding his death including but not limited to his manner of depth the demand is that yay shuts up about the documentary shut up we don't even care whether or not it's true you need to shut up you're not allowed to publish anything about this documentary well guys let me tell you something yay is not going to shut up I spoke to him last night he's not going to shut up I'm not going to shut up I'm certainly not going to shut up this is the greatest lie ever sold you're asking Black America to remain stupid you're asking Black America to remain convinced that all we are are victims of circumstances and that we play no role in those circumstances whatsoever it takes three nanograms of fentanyl on the tip of a pencil to kill a human being and George Floyd had 11 nanograms in his system at the time of death you want Black America to believe it it's just completely irrelevant it's completely relevant it's not irrelevant that's always what you're asking Black America to be emotional and irrational and I'm sick of it I'm also sick of frivolous lawsuits you know if this is actually considered credible if you can sue somebody because you're feeling emotionally distressed because of them going out and saying things well then I think that I have grounds to sue George Floyd's estate I have grounds to sue George Floyd's family for doing this little PR stunt it's causing me a ton of distress I feel angry and I feel upset with the fact that I am fighting for Black America to be freed from the lies while these people are fighting to keep them in the dark this is unacceptable I'm really I'm serious I'm going I'm going to go out and I'm going to ask lawyers if this is legitimate can I sue George Floyd's family because I should be able to in fact we should be able to sue black lives matter we should be able to sue the media that is clearly colluding with George Floyd's family so that they can bury the evidence nobody is going to shut up and I will fight tooth and nail for people to see the truth and that's all I have to say about that okay guys so in the spirit of Halloween season I have something really scary to tell you about and that's meat recalls in case you didn't know there is so much uncertainty that comes with buying meat at the grocery store recently 44 tons of meat products were recalled from retailers in Illinois Kentucky and Missouri for Listeria plus most grocery store meat comes from dairy cattle which is incredibly low quality for all of these reasons I buy my meat from good ranchers it's 100 American me

some topics foreign [Music] I think one of the things that's really strange that I've learned from my husband about how things operate overseas is that the people are taxed to support the BBC the BBC is their you know Public Broadcasting Network I find them to be the equivalent of CNN in America and it would be very weird if we were taxed to keep CNN um in service it's just very weird to me right and what's interesting is that it also makes it very obvious that the BBC is just the propaganda arm for the government of course they can't say anything critical of the government because the government is what is allowing them to function not the free markets right anyways this is super interesting the BBC has prepared secret scripts that could be read on air if energy shortages cause blackouts or the loss of gas supplies this winter in case you missed it Europe is facing an energy crisis we're going to talk more about that tomorrow but the scripts which have been seen by the guardian set out how the Corporation would reassure the public in the event that a major loss of power causes mobile phone networks internet access banking systems or traffic lights to fail across England Wales and Scotland the public would be advised to use car radios or battery-powered receivers to listen to emergency broadcasts on FM and long wave frequencies usually reserved for Radio 2 and radio 4. one draft of their script warns that a blackout could last for up to two days with hospitals and police placed under extreme pressure another script says the government has said it hopes power will be restored in the next 36 to 48 Hours different parts of Britain will start to receive intermittent supplies before then yeah guys how's that green New Deal working out how's that we are no longer independent when it comes to energy which is what every single nation should aspire to you should not rely on others to turn your lights on but of course I don't know in the west we just have this idea that oh no it's good that we should not be you know drilling fossil fuels are bad let's March against fossil fuels let's March against drilling let's March against the pipelines doesn't it feel good Kumbaya but we actually um need to operate our cars and our vehicles oh we need electricity for our electric uh our electric cars where we're gonna get this energy from oh I know let's get it from other countries as long as we feel good even if we're not doing good and we feel good let's do it that's honestly what all of the green New Deal perspectives have been about and of course what it's leading to is more government power and it sounds like Europe and I shouldn't laugh because it's sad but it sounds like Europe especially with the nordstream pipeline having been recently attacked and not being able to sufficiently get the oil and gas that they need from Russia they're going to be facing a crisis winner and their government is now comparing the propaganda that will go out it's probably going to say we're all in this together I know that we the government have the lights on and we are obviously going to make sure that we have the energy first and that we are probably still flying around private but the messaging that needs to go down to the little people is that we're all in this together so go out and get some wood and start a fire because they know what is happening and they know that it is not to the government that will solve this although it is the government that caused these issues moving on here is this is very weird and I promise you it's real when I was shown it I thought it was a joke I thought it was a Saturday Night Live unfunny spoof maybe I thought maybe it was a Babylon B headline it's not rep Eric swalwell of California you know him he sucks he released a campaign video that forecasts the future for families in states where abortion is outlawed so this is supposed to be a futuristic video this is what's going to happen if we Outlaw abortion the video for the former prosecutor is entitled Locker up and it opens with a family that is sitting around a dinner table when suddenly two police officers knock on the door and announce that they are going to be arresting the mother for unlawfully terminating a pregnancy take a listen [Music] it's weird but cute gross down Mary Anderson yes I have a warrant for your arrest but rest for what penal code 243 violation unlawful termination of a pregnancy you've got to be kidding me that that is my personal business that's for the courts to decide ma'am your medical records have been subpoenaed and Dr Landry's already in custody no my God you you can't just you will have to submit to a physical examination put your hands behind your back now why is this happening love you honey bear we're just enforcing the law here elections have consequences vote Democrat on November 8th stop Republicans from criminalizing abortion everywhere protect women's rights and freedom please don't do this [Laughter] they are correct elections of consequences in California you elected an idiot his name is Eric swalwell and he actually thought this was a good video This is actually premiering I mean could you imagine watching this on TV and not and actually thinking that it's a joke and it's real I keep thinking this is going to rally the troops behind him oh my God it's so true if I don't vote for Eric swalwell then obviously the police are going to be knocking on my door and they're gonna pull out their guns while there's a baby sitting in a high chair I mean it's just it's just stupid I mean this is it this is all they've got it's just this never-ending fear campaign it should try to push in force through their policies I mean first and foremost the great irony by the way is that there is no state that gives your gift gives parents less control over their children than California right if you're going to talk about the dystopian nightmare that is California I remember when I was doing my series um a shot in the dark which I released on parlor talking about why I chose not to vaccinate my children neither of my children are vaccinated I'm very proud and open about that I don't mind if you do something different but this is how I live my life and I I remember all of the moms who were writing to me from California were saying okay but we literally don't have the option to choose that in California California will send around the DCS if you do not get the vaccines as mandated by the state so so you don't even have parents in that state if you're going to have people knocking on the door it's probably going to be the government because you're making decisions about the health of your children it's not going to be the government because you got an abortion and they're going to whip uh pistols out on you and tell you that you're under arrest while you're eating dinner with your family again this is all just fear-mongering and it's all the left has it's all they have left it's how they are able to assert control if there's any person that is watching that going yeah that's why why I have to vote um then you represent a very real argument of why there should be a basic IQ test before you're allowed to vote up next because Democrats don't even realize what they're saying half the time this is also hilarious Stacy Abrams joined Morning Joe on MSNBC and she said that more abortions could help solve the inflation problem I wish I was kidding I'm not take a listen having children is why you're worried about your price for gas it's why you're concerned about how much food costs for women this is not a reductive issue you can't divorce being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy from the economic realities of having a child to say guys I know you're concerned about the gas prices I know you're a little concerned about what's happening at the grocery store and that you're spending a hundred dollars for a little slice of steak but have you ever thought that it's actually your fault because you had children actually the problem is that you're alive the problem is that you're breathing it's not that the government totally messed up and their policies have been anti-nationalistic right basically telling us that we should be dependent upon other nations and that Joe Biden should be on his hands and knees begging OPEC to turn on the lights or that Europe should be on their hands and knees begging Russia to turn on the lights no that's not the problem the problem is that your government being stupid the problem is that you're breathing genius why didn't I think of it why didn't I think of it oh I know because I'm not a Democrat and I just could not imagine having the audacity to look people in the faces that are suffering that are truly suffering because my goodness look at the price of gas my goodness when I go to the grocery store in fact my makeup artist said this morning I just got stuff to make tacos literally just to make tacos I didn't even get the Shell at at the grocery store and it cost her ninety dollars ninety dollars for taco night doesn't even make sense but forget the fact that these people are actually suffering that all of us are realizing that there is this much inflation and forget actually saying I'm sorry we messed up we messed up we should have had better policies and you know what we're going to do we are going to stop boycotting against the pipelines right we are we are a nation that could be energy independent and we're going to take every step to make that happen rather than doing that they are draining our oil reserves and getting their politicians on stage to tell you stop breathing essentially just stop breathing stop creating so many people that breathe you know it's basically like saying stop being poor that's it that's the message from a Democrat Party up next guys and speaking of things that are hilarious there was a girl on tick tock she says that she went to high school with me and she dropped a video uh basically calling me a fraud and a hurt fraud though because of what I lived through in high school this again is a reaction there's been tons of tick tock videos that are being made by individuals because of my George Floyd documentary it's very problematic to tell the truth and so now the media is platforming anyone and anything that is against Candace Owens let's take a listen to what she had to say I don't want to be a part of this culture you can stick around if you want you can go watch the original video for context I got something to say to Candace she's probably never gonna see this but I just want to say my piece I see it hey Candace hey girls you remember High School I remember High School it was it was quite a while ago it was like 15 years ago you remember 2007 I remember 2007 yeah um I remember some very horrible things happen to you in 2007 and some very racist white children called you including the mayor's son and said some very racist things to you and threatened your life that should have never happened to you that was terrible um I remember you sued the school board for that I remember because everybody was talking about it my family was talking about it my grandma was calling up your grandma uh the entire school school system was talking about it it was a huge deal because the mayor's son was involved and you had the NAACP backing you up when that happened and they got you your settlement you should I think I I think you should have gotten more because I am always ready to let racists Pockets bleed but regardless NAACP backs you up the black community backed you up wow this is a compelling story it's it's a compelling story that in high school I received some racist messages from some powerful Democrats Sons it's compelling and the NAACP helped me get a settlement and you know what I I have no idea who this person is I made a tick tock video but I have to be honest I do remember the story in fact I remember it so well so well that is chapter two of my book this girl of course journalists never fact check whether I'm not going to school with me nobody cares right it's somebody that is on Tick Tock where we all go to get our information now right saying that she went to school with me that her grandma called me well I'll be able to fact check that because my grandmother's been dead since 2013. but this girl remembers this I have no idea this human being is I messaged four people when I went to high school up and said is anybody recognize this girl from the class of 2007 in Stanford high and everyone came back and said no okay I can tell you definitively she never was in a class with me in 2007 in Stanford high school at the very least was not in a class with me all throughout school and yet she makes me doing Tick Tock and it gets millions of views and people go oh my gosh she brought up the NAACP the NAACP was involved oh what I can confirm is that this girl read my book yeah you're right the NAACP was involved they never spoke to me but they showed up at my school with cameras because they wanted to fundraise off of a girl that had suffered through something that was is very real it's actually the reason that I am conservative it's the reason why I stand up against these race Hustlers like the NAACP because for me it's real they used me they lied and they never checked up with me it was all about getting headlines and so you are not breaking any stories but I am glad that unlike the people that shared this video you actually read again chapter 2 of my book blackout it's been on sale for the last two years I suggest everybody else go read it and get up on that story all right guys it is now time to get into some of your comments I love your comments I'm always reading them so here's the first one so this one's from Noelle and she is responding to me defending Matt Walsh we have still don't know why Matt Walsh went viral over anime and him just saying just feel satanic but she writes I'm into anime and I could and I can argue against some of those things again indeed there are some enemies that have a lot of demonic things but there are others that just don't every anime has different authors ideas and beliefs behind them so no anime cannot be encapsulated as a whole it has a lot of variety I don't think cartoon style shows are only for kids actually the cartoon the show itself is one way to deliver a message again there is indeed some satanic and demonic things in some animes it's not a secret but it also happens in normal and regular TV shows so yeah in conclusion in this case the problem is not the delivery the anime show the cartoon style show it is the message that it portrays Noel I totally agree I actually am not into anime at all I was just being tongue-in-cheek when I defended Matt Walsh because I think he was just being funny and somehow something that he said that was sort of funny got taken very seriously and here's what I will say you are correct that irrespective of whether we're talking about cartoons or anime that there could always be a demonic message delivered hello we have kids today that are learning via cartoons that they can pick their genders they're learning about being lesbian and being gay via cartoons we are constantly having to fight for this perversity not to be throughout children's cartoons and that there's nothing more demonic to me than trying to confuse children and trying to seek authority over them authority over them irrespective irregardless of their parents and the structures that are at home so I don't disagree with your statement but don't take me too seriously on weighing in on anime next comment is from Nana bars she wrote the political sadism fetish that you speak of reminds me of the 1700 to the 1800s British period dramas that I watch a time in human history when everyone enjoyed going to the Town Square to watch someone be hanged or beaten to death wow I love that comment it is so true and that is how I have felt in fact my producer said something which is very true if you look over the last two weeks since I put on the White lives matter shirt essentially what's been happening is a waterboarding it's been a media waterboarding and everyone is attacking me from every single angle demanding that I do this and demanding that I do that and the reason is because they want me to suffer the consequences from putting on that white lives matter shirt but the person they want to suffer more is yay because he is a bigger figure than me he's a globally recognized figure who is standing up to the Mob and so the mob is now demanding his head on the platter and they want everyone to meet in Town Square and to watch him be hung which brings us back to this frivolous lawsuit that has now been launched against him from George Floyd's family um you know the lies are angry at the truth and the best thing for the truth to do is to remain resilient next comment Satan seems to hate women it could be that they can create a life and he can't Envy which usually comes out as mocking hateful mean-spirited comments and or actions when in fact it's jealousy you can apply this to a lot of their other Concepts too they are never going to admit they're jealous and or envious so it just comes out as hateful uh this is a comment that is in response to me discussing the two trans or whatever part of the Alphabet letter soup it was the podcast where they were talking about what it is to be a woman and you are correct I do believe that transgenderism is a form of misogyny they are hyper focused on aspects of Womanhood that are not real I don't know a single woman that acts out a caricature who talks like I'm just gonna happen to bed like that would be so annoying it would be so annoying if there was a woman that acted like that because it would seem like theater it would would seem like something that you expected to see when you went to watch a play it would seem like a stand-up comedic act that is just saying you know mocking women essentially and the fact that this has been allowed to go on so long and people don't understand why women are upset about it women like JK Rowling who have stood up to the Mob and said this is not okay being a woman is a real thing we go through real struggles and allowing a man to put on a wig and pretend that that's it that's all it took is allowing men to laugh at us and it needs to stop final comment from Shannon Matthews I buy a lot of beauty products at Ulta clearly we now need an alternative we have Jeremy's razors I think it is time for the daily wire to launch Candace Beauty oh I love that I take that comment as a badge of honor we do need that actually I would love to get into makeup I'd probably be very difficult to work with because I'm very specific so I'm not about ever selling to women something that would make their skin break out I was traumatized that would happen with me with Mac products in fact this is a true story when I first started working here there was a Advertiser that wanted me to like read ads for them and I went and I used the product and my face broke out and I refused to read the ads because I said it is a sin to promote to women something that is actually going to hurt their skin and I will not do it I will never do it it just I mean that is if you want to talk about the greatest lie ever sold it's Mac Studio fix fluid all right before we continue I want to talk to you about

the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you [Music]", "gJxZovw6o2E": "all right guys question of the day today did Elon Musk just prevent World War III yeah he did and I'm going to explain to you how plus there's a new gender identity that has recently been announced in the world of course it happened on Tick Tock and that identity is trigender which is the gender identity to describe being male and female and neither all at the exact same time because why not all that and more today on Kenneth Owens [Music] so I want to talk to you guys about Western propaganda it is something that fascinates me there seems to be almost a departure in people's minds they somehow feel that oh well that kind of stuff happens in the East it happens in China oh it can happen in a communist Nation we know there's propaganda everywhere but not here we're somehow better we're better we're more free here and it should just be so obvious by now that that is not the circumstance I don't know what more evidence people need to recognize that we are existing under the exact same web of propaganda our media in lockstep on various different narratives like coven like the Ukrainian War which I want to talk to you guys about following a tremendous update yesterday but first and foremost we had president Donald Trump announced that he is running for president in 2024 nobody is surprised of course by that announcement we knew it was coming and you could sense that it was coming imminently because the Press sort of started this peer pressure campaign to divide people in the GOP oh Trump trump needs to step down Trump the entire midterms was lost because Trump just won't go away then Trump kind of defies them stands up and says guess what I'm running haha and then in true Western propaganda Forum they were in lockstep across the media just insulting him it was almost it was just Petty do you even in any of your memory do you remember prior to Trump becoming president United States the media not just allowing someone to announce that they were running that used to just be a thing you just announced wherever you wanted to you could just walk outside of your house and say hey by the way I'm running for president the media went so-and-so just announced and you could just do whatever you wanted to beyond that you know they don't really care too much about the actual announcement but of course it's Donald Trump and so the media ran with all sorts of wild headlines instantly in fact while he was still on stage announcing that he was running they were talking about how boring how boring it was oh my gosh even Fox News had to cut away from this boring announcement here were just a few of the headlines that ran the NPR went with Donald Trump who tried tried to overturn Biden's legitimate election launches 2024 bid that's totally not partisan at all this also was the headline Trump twice impeached and under criminal investigation launches 2024 campaign another one from our friends over at NBC Trump whose lies about the 2020 election inspired an Insurrection announces a third White House bid another one Donald Trump who was impeached twice is running for president again NPR even came out with a tweet breaking Donald Trump who tried to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and inspired a deadly ride at the Capitol in a desperate attempt to keep himself in power has filed to run for president again okay we get it narrative he's an evil monster he's an evil monster that won't go away he's an evil monster that has led to people dying on January 6 and my people dying we mean Ashley Babbitt who was shot by a police officer and we can't figure out why or any details of that case but no go with that go with that he's an evil murderous dictator and we're going to be in lockstep about that and it's because we are trying to tell people the truth not because we all seem to be operating and getting together in lockstep and it seemed to be getting a phone call almost from the CIA it's like hey just say that Trump's a monster and go with that headline that's what it feels like it feels like operation Mockingbird which brings me to the next next person that I want to talk about which is President zielinski I have been vocal since the very beginning about the fact that he is a dirt bag I can't make myself any clear on that that is the truth president zielinski is a dirt bag just when they'd abandoned the coveted narrative Justin they told you to forget about Afghanistan and US drawing out of Afghanistan in a very sloppy manner they told you that suddenly you needed to trade in your BLM flags for Ukrainian flags and president zielinski became a hero overnight in the media the same media just a few short years prior had told us that he is attached to oligarchs we understand that Ukraine has been a laundromat we understand that he quite literally used to be an actor and he was funded by a man named Igor kolamoisky who is an oligarch he funded him into Powers one ski into power and he has been doing the bidding of the West for a long time he has ties via Igor kolamoisky to Hunter Biden okay he is just not a good character but the media basically said here's the thing you either get on team zielinski or we are going to smear you as a pro Putin puppet I didn't take that bait because I don't care why why would I care it's so untrue Candace it must be accepting funds from from Putin that's actually what they were trying to allege in the Press is that somehow every person who was sober in their analysis of recognizing that um I don't know something feels a little weird about this it's a little weird about President zielinski we're being told he's a hero he's very clearly got a stylist right he's wearing the same outfit almost every time you see him perfectly the sleeves are rolled up he's inviting the press and and saying that he you know he's fighting the good fight it just feels like I'm watching a Netflix series right it feels like this is a Netflix series and whoever is styling him believes that this is what he should wear there's no reason by the way that zelinski is not wearing a suit every day he is not in fact fighting on the ground but he wants you to feel like he is right while him and his wife make time for vanity bear while they make time for Vogue while they make time to meet with Sean Penn and take his Oscar and to record the moment while they make time to give a speech as he did at the Grammys but you're still supposed to feel that he's in the trenches guys he's just like you which is why we should keep giving him billions of dollars well just thought that it wasn't plausible that I could like zielinski less I really I said to myself I actually can't like him less he's The Welfare Queen of America and I I just I'm at the bottom here he went ahead and unlocked another basement of ways for me to dislike him and it began yesterday with a tweet okay so zelenski tweeted this yesterday had a call with the president of Poland expressed condolences over the death of Polish citizens from Russian missile Terror we exchanged available information and are clarifying all the facts all of Europe and the world must be fully protected from terrorist Russia so in case you missed it yesterday and what he is very heavily implying in this tweet that there were some missiles that hit polish territory that hit Poland and two polish citizens are now dead and he is basically confirming that that actually took place and the world was on fire because obviously the implications of that would be severe the implications are that Russia has now attacked Poland World War II Germany attacking Poland which led to this world war right so he's basically saying this has happened everyone went completely crazy and he didn't just limit it to saying that via a tweet he also put out a video and in this video he said quote terror is not limited to our national borders Russian missiles hit Poland to fire missiles at NATO territory this is a Russian missile attack on collective security this is a very significant escalation we must act okay very clearly he is saying to you that it is time for NATO to get involved Russia has now attacked NATO they are goating NATO now why does that tweet and that video make entirely no sense to me why when I saw this did I say clearly this is a lie I didn't even need to get into the trenches I didn't even need to speak to people that were on the ground it just the narrative defied common sense why well first and foremost because Putin is losing the war in Ukraine right Russia is losing the war in Ukraine so if you're Vladimir Putin unless you're completely crazy right why on Earth while you're losing a battle in Ukraine would you would you then say okay now let's go ahead and launch a war with the entire West I was go attack Poland does that make any sense to you again you don't necessarily need to be an expert here you just need to have a little bit of a thinking faculty a little bit of a critical thinking faculty the second reason this makes no sense is that the entire purpose of the war if you were paying attention to Vladimir Putin's speeches was that he felt that NATO was encroaching on his territory right he did not want NATO he did not want Ukraine to become a member of NATO he was very clear in saying that for years by the way leading up to this conflict especially but for years they've been very clear Ukraine must remain neutral they cannot join NATO so he doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO but he then decides while he's losing a war in Ukraine to attack NATO to attack nato in Poland which is a which is a NATO member country he would just do this what sense does that make the third reason why this defied Logic for me was the idea that if Putin was completely off his rocker and decided that you know what it's not enough just losing Ukraine I now want to start this beef with all of Europe and America you think that's what he's gonna do he's just gonna kill two farmers that that's the way that you invade Poland you just kill two farmers On the Border yeah no that defies common sense and we're just not allowed to have common sense because they they control the narrative right I mean Vanity Fair Vogue and Forbes and Time Magazine twice now and the Grammys have all told us that zolenski is this wonderful character and we all need to like them so suspend your common sense for a minute and believe that he therefore must be telling the truth but then something happened and this is why I say Elon Musk may have just prevented World War III you see the reason that they have wanted control over Twitter and over Facebook via facts Checkers which are obviously just sensors right these are sensor Lords the reason is that they can control the narrative and a free internet when we are free to converse and share information and we can all become citizen journalists this empowers the mainstream journalists from being able to sell us a narrative right it very quickly can lead to their narrative falling apart and so Elon Musk looked over Twitter it became a way for us to once again exchange info information freely apps into the quote-unquote fact Checker is telling us that this is not true and zolenski is amazing what ended up happening was that a user on Twitter who happens to track Ukrainian Weaponry used a photo of the debris to identify the weapon here is what that user tweeted he tweeted so what crashed in the village of Poland today with the cooperation of blue boy that's another Twitter user we analyzed the available photos of fragments and came to a clear conclusion that they belong to the 48d6 motor of the 5v55 series missile of the s-300 ad system a Ukrainian one oh oh I'm sorry what you're saying this is a Ukrainian missile he shows the fragments in the pictures and he goes on to talk about how he understands that this is actually this would have been fired by Ukraine and this tweet goes viral uh oh sensor Lourdes what are you gonna do this guy is saying that this belongs to Ukraine are you going to try to put this uni back in the bottle are you are you gonna just say oh it was a misunderstanding oh yeah guys that's it's actually exactly what they did actually this morning waking up now NBC and CNN and the Wall Street Journal are all admitting that actually no it was Ukraine it was it was actually a Ukrainian missile that landed on polished soil and they are saying that it was by accident guys so don't get too conspiratory it was just an accident it was a mixed up zolenski didn't know that it was Ukrainian he's only the president of Ukraine how is he supposed to know that it was actually his defense team that fired that message that landed in polished territory he was he wasn't trying to start World War III except he was that's the truth zielinski attempted to start World War III yesterday he attempted the assassination of Archduke Arc Ferdinand right he essentially said where are you NATO where are you America Poland has been attacked and we now must all be in Allegiance and we must size up and attack Russia today and also I want more money because I'm still The Welfare Queen of America he did that he intentionally lied he intentionally spread misinformation because he wanted the globe to react to his lies and here's my personal take he didn't act alone right we're supposed to believe that he actually alone but no no no no zielinski is just a bad faith actor right he's a real actor and a bad faith one and I believe that what they attempted yesterday was a false flag attack and I believe that he did this because he was instructed to do this and I'm wondering to what extent the West Was in on this to what extent perhaps even our own intelligence agencies were in lockstep saying here's how we're going to do it here's how we're going to convince the public that we now have a reason to join this effort not just by proxy by sending Weaponry or sending billions of dollars of cash on hand to help Ukraine but also giving them a moral and emotional reason to believe that we should be involved so yes that is what's happening you have people in power that are attempting to legitimatize starting World War III and the only way we're going to prevent it is by continuing to share information and continuing to have the courage to call out zielinski for what he is right I've said it once I've said it twice and I will keep saying it he is a dirt bag and I will also say the reason that I prefer a Vladimir Putin who does not doesn't pretend to be a nice guy we know he's a villain Vladimir Putin at least will look you in the face and say here's what I want I am a villain right compared to zelensky who pretends to be a good guy but is also a villain these are two villains that are operating differently solemski is doing the leftist strategy zelenski is pretending that he cares about LBGTQ rights and BLM and just wants to be in partnership with everybody right he's the James Corden character right love love fun fun everybody sing along to these Tunes but also secretly I yell at waiters on my own because that's how I am I'm actually not a nice guy at all he is selling us a pitch of goodness when in reality he is a bad person I prefer someone like Putin who just says I'm a bad guy and I'm not even gonna play the game or pretending that I'm something else and that's all that I have to say about that all right I'd like to take a second to talk to you guys about front page magazine founded by best-selling author David Horowitz front page magazine has spent all over two decades combating the radical left's efforts to destroy America there are two new podcasts the right take with Mark tapson and the Jason Hill show offer riveting interviews and insightful coverage of politics culture and current events the right take with Mark Thompson offers fascinating in-depth cultural commentary as well as interviews with well-known conservative thinkers the Jason Hill show offers thoughtful deep dives into the ideologies at the radical left and interviews with renowned intellectuals it takes a village to combat the radical left's efforts to destroy America that's why as a fan of my show you should also check out these guys over at front page magazine by visiting frontpagemag.com and while you're there support their cause by making a tax-deductible donation inside every Progressive is a totalitarian screaming to get out and no one understands that better than the team over at front page magazine go check out frontpagemag.com today okay now it's time for some topics foreign [Music] speaking of Western officials and politicians who like to launder money via various never-ending Wars who could forget Afghanistan our very sloppy exit from Afghanistan after decades fighting there and spending billions there we'll never know where all that money went we do know some of it at least went to the Taliban since we just decided to leave all of our weaponry and she sheepishly walk away and say oh just time to bring bring the troops home okay I'm sure Biden I'm sure I'm sure you weren't just working on the next money laundering operation so I want to update you guys what's going on in Afghanistan today because it is relevant obviously the Taliban is in power and they have now adopted full Sharia law in Afghanistan the judges there are ordered by the islamist group's leader to enforce stonings floggings and limb amputations Afghanistan's supreme leader has ordered judges to fully enforce all aspects of Islamic law which includes public executions and stonings and the Taliban Chief spoke man spokesman his name is zapahula majuhad tweeted late on Sunday that the obligatory command came after the secretive leader met with a group of Judges so they basically said listen uh I know that we promised there would be a softer version of the harsh rule but actually no we just want to bring it back and we will be taking all of your rights and all of your freedoms if you do not comply and this is an interesting topic for me because I remember sitting down and by the way let me make it clear that I'm not endorsing Sharia law whatsoever I just am bringing some interesting commentary but I remember sitting down with a friend of mine you might know him you might follow him his name was zooby and he grew up in Saudi Arabia even though he's an English citizen he grew up in Saudi Arabia because of his father's job and I was talking to him trying to understand how I mean just what it's like living under a theocracy and I was coming from a very Western angle just saying hey zubi that's got to be crazy to see this kind of a thing like what happens the idea of someone being stoned or getting their arms cut off if they steal what's that like and I was so shocked in his response when he said there's no crime he said there's it's actually what you're looking at is they are an extreme right to live on a Sharia law is an extreme he's like but to live in the way that you guys live here in America is another kind of extreme way that you might feel walking down the streets of San Francisco is another kind of extreme right so we've just gone we are complete opposite extremes and neither of these is necessarily a solution so he said it was essentially he lived in a crimeless society he said because what it does to someone mentally right if you know that to steal it's going to cost you your hands they're just not going to steal it's not even a thought right if you know that if you steal something a judge is going to release you back onto the streets ah what's happening in a lot of our inner city communities like Philadelphia where you can or New York City where you can shoot somebody and potentially be released the same day as that inspires criminality so I wanted to offer that commentary as Food For Thoughts because I know now I always consider that when I read about these very extreme societies again not an endorsement to that extremity but also saying that we shouldn't be endorsing the other extremities which are evident in our society today there is no reason to pay Verizon ATT and T-Mobile over 80 a month for wireless Services when you can get the same service on the same network at Pure Talk for half the price with pure talk you can get talk text and data that's just as fast for just thirty dollars a month those other guys are making you pay for thousands of retail stores that you don't go to perks that you don't use and massive profits to keep their shareholders happy peer talk on the other hand wants to keep you happy which is why they've invested a us-based customer service team it's also why they give you so many more data options because why would they charge you for data that you don't need I like pure talk because I like supporting veteran-owned us-based companies that have my best interests at heart it takes less than 10 minutes to make the switch and you're going to save a ton of money now is your chance to show Corporate America that you're done funding their leftist ideologies go to puretalk.com and enter code Owens to save 50 off your first month that's puretalk.com promo code Owens for 50 off your first month I do also want to move into providing you guys an update on the story you know we covered it's just such a bizarre story and I think it's because they've been piecemealing information and it's very rare for for campus University students to die and for the police to be so tight-lipped about how they died and they were describing it as a crime of passion absent any details and the reason why I find it very necessary for them to give us more details on how these students died at the University of Idaho is because a lot of parents are rightfully traumatized you could only imagine what it is like to wake up knowing that your young child goes to University that this could have been them and you're not getting any information as to how all four of these children these students died on campus in their homes and they're just calling it a crime of passion they're not saying whether or not they've caught to the individual that was behind this well I was able to to reach out to someone who was commenting on the story on Twitter who does attend the University I was able to confirm his identity he is a student there and he is friends with one of the victims and he did not want to come on the show obviously because this is a tragedy and he did not want to look like someone who was you know I guess trampling over the friends and the family members of these victims but he did provide me with a little more information and we have since seen it reflected in the media it seems today that these University students it was a stabbing a very tragic stabbing and still not sure who was behind the stabbing but he did inform me that both people that are in sororities were told that they could not the University Police could not keep them safe at this time that they were unwilling to say that they that they were safe and so everybody is essentially up and left the university and he is one of these people they've just left because they don't feel safe and it's a very dark story but yes a person close to the investigation said that there was blood everywhere on dailymail.com they released blood that was actually leaking outside of the home so it seems incredibly violent uh dribbling down the side of the house and just a tremendous tremendous tragedy they are describing it as a one-off situation type situation so who knows uh what led to these events nothing could ever justify obviously what has happened here we don't know if it was a crime of passion or a burglary burglary gone wrong but I promise to keep you guys up to date on the many possibilities that are happening and we will continue to try to get more information as it becomes available next thing I want to talk to you guys about Switching gears here is gender identity because it's very important that you do your part and just try to keep up with all the 37 000 genders that are out there today and it's important that you do your part and try to come up with them because you don't want to be a bigot and it would be bigoted for you not to understand that everybody can be everything at all times and at no times including this young woman who is on Tick Tock which I have always described as a platform for mental illness in its entirety if you have a mental illness you should have a tick tock if you don't have mental illness maybe get off tick tock not just what I'm saying I think it inspires it but this young I was almost going to say woman crazy Candace crazy this young he she thingy it did a video and this is what the he she thingy it has to say take a listen you might have been surprised by my transgender pin that I put on this morning I figured it's about time that I came out and talked about my gender identity I am trigender which means like a triangle I have three genders male female and non-binary and the difference between trigender and gender fluid is that I feel all three of these genders at the same time all the time it doesn't ever shift or change or where I feel one gender more strongly than the other like gender fluid tends to be also I should recognize and accept that a lot of people don't see non-binary as a third gender they see it as something completely separate from the binary of male and female but for me it's like a third gender or I guess you could call it a Third identity so how I feel gender wise is like a man like a woman and as neither at the same time I hope this clears things up but let me know if you have any more questions I'm happy to answer what I love is that at the end of that she's like I hope this clears things up like no obviously that cleared nothing up like why would that why would that clear anything up I'm a man and I'm a woman and I'm neither at the exact same time I hope this clears things up it's just complete lunacy I mean I am happy that these various illnesses are finding a home on Tick Tock I did not mean that last statement I just said I just said it I don't know hope that clears things up it's just like this is split personality disorder obviously you know it might even be equal parts schizophrenia but what this is not is an actual gender obviously if he's not a tri-gender she's a girl that is looking for attention and is finding it on Tick Tock and people are asking her more specific questions which is giving her a dopamine hit and realizing that she's on some Journey where people are maybe paying attention to her for the first time you know what I mean which is an element of growing up is trying to find your tribe and people are looking for attention and rather than being maybe the quiet kid who doesn't have a lot of school friends you can now become a very well-liked person by being extreme on social media and so that's what you're watching that's what you're observing you're observing a bunch of kids that probably are not comfortable in their own skin that are trying to be cool in some work guard by pretending to be trigender or whatever gender that it is well one thing that's good for this girl is that potentially she will be able to find a home on the dating app hinge because hinge has given itself a nice little woke update the dating app which you guys might be familiar with has launched a relationship type feature that lets daters specify if they're looking for monogamous or polyamorous partners hinge has introduced a new feature this week called relationship type it allows you to specify the type of commitment that you're looking for and it has come as research has revealed that five percent of people are now in polyamorous relationships so Michelle Parsons she's the chief product officer over red hinge says with the launch of relationship type we are empowering users to openly share what kind of relationship they are looking for and as a result have a new way to know if someone's dating goals match theirs the moment they look at their profile Fair totally fair I think it's yeah it's be nice to know if somebody just is into being a little bit promiscuous a little and now you can have a filter that just says I'm pretending that this is a relationship type but in reality I just want to sleep with a bunch of women they have a bunch of women that are pretending that they're free and open to all different types when in reality they're just insecure and are commuting what they actually want to match the times and the times are telling them that the best way to be empowered is by realizing that you don't need a man and that you're open to all different types of relationships and that's it Society is what is putting these constraints on you and to really be loving and free and on ecstasy and Mali you need to swipe your relationship type to available to everyone and at the same time lose a little piece of your soul every time you go on one to one of these dates and so now I'm glad that hinge has provided that update so that you can freely give away your soul to whoever you

my episode that I did on MK Ultra you guys seem to really like that you guys basically told me in equal parts that this is amazing I can't believe you're talking about it which I thought was shocking because I thought it's literally Declassified CIA docs but I realize that people in the mainstream don't tend to talk about that and then the other parts you guys told me that I was probably gonna get killed so I just want to say officially I am not suicidal can of summons didn't kill herself please save that clip okay first comment from grumpy six he says my father was in the 82nd Airborne and said a bunch of CIA agents came to question them before they went to Korea and he said they offered him a drink and they answered the questions and he had to leave because he had to go on guard Duty and while driving the GP said the telephone poles looked like they were were melting and he wretched the Jeep causing him severe facial damage they blamed it on him but my father said somebody had doped him and it could have only been the CIA for that was the only drink that he had drunk for five hours prior to the meeting your dad is definitely telling the truth they notoriously experiment on people that are in the military they view them as proprietary uh subjects and and this has gone on for Beyond so many scandals that have happened in terms of military men and women being experimented on throughout the years and it's why I was so morally opposed and repulsed by the idea that the healthiest people in the United States being people that are in the United States military had to submit themselves to the coveted vaccine or use their lose their job that was more experimentation on people that serve the country people that should be treated the best were actually being treated the worst and that has actually always been the circumstance and so yeah I am very sad to hear about your father had severe facial damage and it's even more incredible at a gas limit pretended that he just saw polls melting but that is what we were are dealing with next comment comes from Delena she is commenting regarding the 10 year old teacher who called the police you'll recall he was a 10 year old who got a tattoo and the police were called and the mother of that 10 year old got arrested as well as the person who administered the tattoo Delena says interesting conversation Candace thank you children from indigenous tribes have worn tattoos for centuries then we have girls and women who have undergone female genital mutilation predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and Arab states female genital mutilation is also practiced in select countries in Asia Eastern Europe and Latin America it is also practiced among migrant populations throughout Europe North America Australia and New Zealand the West frowns on these cultures and their ancestral heritage yet the area of the United States parents are practicing genital modification on young children in relation to gender isn't that illegal a form of depopulation mentally engineered to biologically engineer yes I'm glad that you brought up mental engineering because I think about that all the time how the West that we have this concept that we have a more wholesome culture and we engage in things that are just as egregious but we wrap it up and make it sound pretty right so it is that's why I always say what's happening in terms of the transgender movement is a form of genital mutilation and we say we frown upon cultures that take place in female genital mutilation but we also are the only Western Country that engages outside of being obviously Jewish or Muslim and just having the men get circumcised like they all get their penis circumcised in America right when they're born and that doesn't take place anywhere else in Western Society not Canada uh not down in South America so it's very unique to American culture I was shocked to learn that they don't do this in Europe and the United Kingdom they think that's very weird that American men do this but we Justified it because you know uh they told us that this was the clean thing to do and that it would help your child further on from getting different types of penile Cancers and the facts and the statistics completely to betray that narrative so there are tons of ways in which we are hypocritical about the things that we're comfortable with and not comfortable with and I'm glad that you're at least thinking about that and expanding your thoughts that's what I'm here for next comment is regarding Pete Davidson dating Emily rajakowski I hope it's a conspiracy a voice you love writes while I sympathize for what he went through at age seven that being his father dying in a collapsed building trying to save people during the 9 11 attack I kind of view his online line portrayal similar to that of Greta thundberg both are victims of the press and propagated as being more than what they really are the fact of the matter is he was a drug addict for a very long time and definitely suffers from PTSD to this day as for his dating scene I view it like a charity case none of the women he stated honestly care about him in fact aside from Selena they were just using him I'm not sure who Selena is but in my personal opinion yeah I do also feel that he is being used there is something that is sad about him like I don't I don't hate Pete Davidson I don't just strongly dislike Pete Davidson I just don't like the media's portrayal and Narrative of him and it's very obvious to me that he does suffer from a lot of issues again he went to rehab I do have it I I do also know I've been told at least that he does still suffer from various addictions and yet the media hides this while attacking other people because for whatever reason they just want him sort of platformed in a really bizarre way I don't know where it comes from and yes it is tremendously sad what happened to his father during 9 11 attack and that might have a lot to do with the issues that he's facing today but we don't resolve those issues by pretending that he's this perfect Prince Charming who just dates a lot of pop girls so um I think it's good that he's taking a step trying to at least take a step back from Saturday Night Live and yeah we'll see where it goes next question regarding Sean Penn giving zielinski the Oscar Kim writes the fact that he had to pack that and carry it with him is crazy it wasn't spur at the moment like he saw him admiring it or a story was told and a light bulb went off man's really thought that that thing has value and was needed yeah it's it's a joke you should laugh at the media puppeting him you should laugh at the fact that he's throwing YouTube concerts in the Subways of Ukraine and that he's getting you know dressed up every single day and that so many A-list celebrities are flocking to him and you should laugh because it's obvious that this is a part of a propagandist network and that we're being lied to and we should stop laughing however when it comes to the idea that this man could Inspire World War III and that is where I draw the line next comment is regarding an earlier conversation that we had about potentially lowering the drinking age I think that we should because everybody is drinking when they're 10 not 10 but you know what I mean I'm being hyperbolic uh you naughty right no don't do it I'm South African and the one thing I commended Americans on was a way that they spaced out the drinking age especially from the driving age in my country we have such high car accident rates and I strongly believe that it's due to the fact that drinking age is 18 as well as a driving age I'm 19 and we were told by scientists that our brains aren't even fully developed so why should we load such a delicate thing into the hands of undeveloped people we already have so much to figure out and I don't think a change in American legislation considering alcohol age limits would help I actually disagree because college campuses everybody drinks that's that's my point is that it's not stopping I have a girlfriend that got a DUI she wasn't 21 she was drinking and this happens over and over again and again if you should be allowed to go serve military you should at the very least be allowed to come back and have a glass of whiskey my personal opinion and by the way I always say don't become a victim to your own circumstances and believing that because that's happening in South Africa that would be the same circumstance here because in European culture they are there is no like implied drinking age you'll get carded when you're in Europe and actually what I have found is that they seem to be a bit more mature about drinking in a weird way like there's like I think because their parents sort of give them a glass of wine at dinner and it doesn't seem like this shiny object of like oh I just can't wait till I turn 21 and I can drink which is kind of what happens then people go crazy they seem to be able to deal with it better and be more mature about drinking now I'm saying that absent the facts I guess I would have to check the car accident rates over in the United Kingdom but you know what I don't have to have any facts I'm just answering the comments so I'm just giving you my feelings here okay I want to take a moment to talk to you guys about

are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "BYSEHFe5P-8": "happy Monday guys question of the day how many wars have we the American people lost but the American government they seem to have won I want you to think about that plus British influencer Ali London who transitioned to a Korean woman earlier this year said he is now transitioning back to be a British man after becoming a Christian all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] so if you were online over the weekend you may have seen a lot of people talking about FTX a lot of people being very upset that FTX which in case you're not aware it is a crypto exchange platform is going bankrupt and they're not by the way just upset that it's going bankrupt but it also seems a bit scandalous in fact it turns out that the CEO may have been taking money from FTX under the guise of helping the war effort in Ukraine and then laundering that money back to Democrats to the tune of 50 million dollars so people have been understandably outraged in fact one tweet from a friend of ours Benny Johnson he wrote this he wrote FTX was a money laundering scam from Democrats 50 million dollars spent on electing Dems this cycle will a single Democrat return the blood Money given to their campaigns through theft of regular Americans savings this should be the biggest scandal in the world right now and I think uh Elon Musk replied to that thread and said no one's going to get in trouble because it's Democrats and he's right and Benny Johnson is right I just I think for me I was a little confused as to why anybody would think that this would be the biggest Scandal why would this be the biggest Scandal pretending to give money to a war and then actually laundering it back to politicians it hasn't that been going on forever am I the only person that realizes it's been going on forever in fact I had somebody mean tweet me why isn't Candace even talking about this as if there was some conspiracy of why I haven't been talking I have been talking about this non-stop since I've had a platform I keep talking about the fact that your government our government is never ever ever going to allow there to be a period of Peace because a period of Peace would mean that they can't launder trillions of dollars away from the American taxpayer back to themselves so people are upset about 50 million dollars well to date we have given 54 billion dollars 54 billion of American taxpayer money to support the war effort in Ukraine now why should you be outraged by that well because apparently we're not fighting that war and yet we've already spent more than we spent the entire time that we were in Afghanistan and we don't know what that money is going toward we have no idea while we have all of these ideolog politicians on stage saying we must win we must support zelensky and his efforts we mustn't talk bad about zelenski we have no idea why one day it was BLM Flags the next day they dropped and everybody put up a Ukraine flag but you can bet your money literally you can bet your money that if the mainstream media is in lockstep on a narrative it means that you are about to be stolen from and so I started thinking about that how many times just I guess really in my recent memory not even going back too far have we all been told that we need to come together to fight something only to have money taken from us and to not have us win the war that we're allegedly fighting to win and then they may look Us in the face and move on to the next one here's just one example what about the war on terrorism we're on my 9 11 grew up during 9 11 people like me we were all told we had to be so scared and terrorism and we we have to fight all of these efforts in the Middle East we need to here's my favorite one ready spread democracy ah I wish I could have a uh a CIA dictionary every time our CIA tells us that we're spreading democracy it usually just means that we're bombing poorer countries and we're bombing them into Oblivion we don't really know why we're doing that but we can bet our money that we're not going to win in those areas because it turns out they don't want our version of quote-unquote spreading democracy so yeah the war on terrorism America spent 6.4 trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East and Asia since 2001. I will again ask the question which one of those wars did we win Iraq no Afghanistan no get out of there quick hand it back to the Taliban so what are we doing oh I know what we're doing we're we're laundering money back to United States politicians that's exactly what's happening and I think it's time for us to go ahead and admit that and it's worse than that it's not just laundering money we're willing to kill American citizens to do that right we have military deaths that are taking place every day in fact on the war on terrorism we lost over 7 000 United States service members and over 8 000 contractors they died Post 9 11 and all of those Wars in Iraq Afghanistan and everywhere else over 30 177 United States service members and Veterans of the post-9 11 Wars have also died via suicide think about that and for what the question is for what or better yet for whom it's not the only war that our government has come to us so that we must fight of course early on it was the War on Drugs remember we have to the War on Drugs people are drug addicts so we need to spend money to stop drug addiction that's been going on since 1971 and in case you want to know how much we've spent we have spent over a trillion dollars enforcing drug policy according to the research from the University of Pennsylvania and what has been the result of that you're looking around and people seem like they're doing less drugs to you are you looking around to visit America that we live in have you been to Los Angeles have you been to San Francisco people are doing this openly in the streets in fact in 2020 91 799 people died in overdose deaths so how's that for the War on Drugs beyond that six thousand and and this is actually more important you should know this When The War Began right just 6771 people were dying of Overdose deaths think about how much bigger that's getting and of course we know that's increasing every single year because of the opioid crisis yeah we're fighting drugs but also our government is in lockstep with the drug manufacturers to get people on drugs that they deem acceptable right everyone nowadays doing some sort of a drug they're putting kids on Adderall they're becoming addicted to Adderall they're putting kids on opioids and then being oh my God we have an opioid epidemic maybe we need to launder even more money away from the taxpayer to fight this never-ending war and it's never ending because we don't want it to end just like the war on covet who could forget I think it's still going on actually the war on covid somehow which is just somehow via a stimulus package they got to take five trillion dollars away from us away from our kids and our grandkids because we're fighting The Invisible War on covid stay at home save lives you don't go to work don't worry your government got you baby it got you to the tune of five trillion dollars and where is the outrage nope people just get right in line we just keep jumping from one idiot narrator to the next really believing that this time our government must really mean it it they're going to rescue us from covid no of course no they just one day decide it's over because we've already agreed to giving them trillions of dollars and so now you can go back outside and you can go to work and you better have no questions because there's no refunds when it comes to the government you know who knows that really well Black America Black America knows that because of course the war on poverty it was all about us the war on poverty since 1964. same year that we passed the Civil Rights Act the government said oh these people are impoverished we've got to help these people get richer look at you Black America and so welfare policies went into place right I wonder how much we've spent on that war on poverty ready 22 trillion dollars since 1964 on anti-poverty programs anti-poverty programs which encourage people to remain impoverished that's what it does and here's an update ready black Americans are poor today than they were when it began so much for winning the war but doesn't matter because the real thing is it's supposed to make us feel good right I feel even though black Americans are poor I feel good for saying that we have been fighting the war even though we have no idea what the hell we are doing in Ukraine or why zelenski is so clearly acting the part of a person in a war-torn Ukraine but it makes us feel good if I feel good when I put the little Ukrainian flag in the corner on my profile right next to my pronoun it makes me feel good I feel good when I say that we're fighting terrorism even though we just keep bombing people into Oblivion we don't really know what's happening to all of that and just I want you guys to know I want you to know that you should feel good even though the FTX may be wiped away 50 million dollars from people's savings money that people didn't have because we were just fighting that feel good War The Invisible enemy of covet I want you to know that you should feel good because at least you thought you were giving to some people in Ukraine and that's really all I have to say about that all right so you guys know that inflation is a huge problem right now so much so that the CEO of JPMorgan just warned that stocks could slide another 20 percent that being said investors are moving their money into Alternatives like Fine Art because fine art has outpaced even the S P 500 over the last 26 years by 131 percent and now with Masterworks you can be a fine art investor II here's how Masterworks works the research team uses proprietary data to determine which artist markets have the most momentum then their Acquisitions team locates what they believe to be a good piece at a fair price and they purchase the work at that point they file an offering circular with the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing anyone to invest they then hold the art for three or ten years when they sell the painting you receive your pro rata proceeds after their fees even in 2022 Masterworks produced results in early October Masterworks had a strategic exit of a 21.5 percent net return to their investors six out of seven exits have produced over 20 percent net returns don't sleep on this paintings are selling out in minutes but you can get Priority Access at masterworks.com canvas Dash promo code Candace at masterworks.com Candace see important disclosures at masterworks.com CD okay now it's time for some topics to sure [Music] all right so today's episode is all about feeling good even though we're not doing good as long as we feel good it's all that matters because the feelings don't care about the facts at all and of course we should then talk about president zielinski who I have been mocking since the very beginning I don't know how any person in good conscience can pretend that he is a serious leader he is so obviously an actor literally an actor that was funded he acted the parts on a series and a show of being a president and then somebody got behind him and paid for him and oligarch paid for him to actually become the president of Ukraine and now we just get to see him acting all the time on the cover of Vanity Fair on the cover of Beau Grammy speeches Oscar speeches for somebody that's in the middle of a war he sure does have a good stylist the photos of him when he was in Forbes and they keep making him wear this ridiculous outfit it's almost like you're just styling someone in war the sleeves rolled up there's actually no reason why president is not wearing a suit every day but the idea is to make us think that he's in the trenches while he's at all of these amazing events everywhere and just kind of doing the rounds in in leftist media so just when you think that you couldn't laugh a lot harder at president zielinski he does something else and this time he is receiving an Oscar award from Sean Penn I don't even know Sean Penn just always in the middle is in the middle of something that feels like a CIA operation every time he pops up he just seems like what are you doing here Sean Penn are you CIA trained well he obviously has gone over and decided to give the Ukrainian president zielinski one of his Oscar just to borrow just like until you win the war here hold the Oscar and of course this makes zielinski who's actually an actor very very happy and here is a clip of that moment and now I am not joking take a listen this is for you oh Sean yes oh please that is yours no I feel terrible outside I just it's just the symbolic silly thing yes but I I know but if I know this is here with you then I'll then I'll feel better and stronger for the fight brain told her but until we will when you when you win bring it back to Malibu right yes okay because I'll feel much better [Music] so I'm just so touched are you not touched and look there he is again in that same styled look because zelenski wearing a sweatshirt because he's one of us can't you feel it he's just in touch with his people and now he's receiving an Oscar so attainable and just so loving and I just I can no longer take anybody serious who's taking this war in Ukraine seriously and not realizing that this is just money laundering that's taking place in front of the American people that's not to say that there are not actual ukrainians that are suffering there are of course there are like there are actual Russians that are suffering of course but this entire narrative if you are still buying that zelenski is just not some bought and paid for politician who's been doing the part of laundering money for the entire Western Hemisphere then you're just not paying attention and I am just Keen to see how he could possibly up the ante after this I don't I don't know how you go from Grammys to Oscars Humanity fair to Vogue I I don't see how he could climb higher when it comes to him just hanging out with celebrities and he also have like YouTube perform in Ukraine in the Subways and yeah I don't know people are people are still buying it be sure to put your Ukrainian flag in your profile today all right guys moving on there is an individual goes by Ali London uh he is in fact from the UK and he transitions into a Korean woman earlier this year and now he says that he is transitioning back to become a British man London is 32 years old and he was embroiled in a controversy after he identified as trans-racial so that in my opinion if you can be transgender I don't see why you couldn't be transracial it makes perfect sense to me before pretending that there's no such thing as objective reality why can't Ali London who is a white male say actually I'm Korean that's what I feel like on the inside and nothing else matters he did this uh for about six months before he realized that this was a lie and this was wrong and here is him speaking to Tucker Carlson on Friday night take a listen I'd as a Korean woman but six months later he's decided he's had enough now he's transitioning back to being a British man we thought we would ask him what that experience was like Ali London joins us tonight Island thanks so much for coming on um so why did you decide to become a Korean woman who told you that was possible so obviously I've had a difficult time with my gender identity struggles I was never unhappy with how I looked so I started changing I started dressing as a Korean woman and I realized that was a big mistake and I just want to be a boy but you know is it any Wonder people like me and young people want to change their gender when we have the normalization of this in our schools in this country children are taught from a young age from the age of five in some cases that it's okay to change their gender it's okay to you know wear a skirt it's okay for a boy to use agenda neutral toilets when it puts girls at risk this is the new norm and schools are teaching about toxic masculinity they're eroding the alpha male the alpha straight male has been eroded you know Tucker what happened years ago when kids used to go to school they used to idolize Superman and astronauts now kids are being pushed this radical ideology they're taught to idolize weak men like Harry Styles weak politicians like beta O'Rourke why is this happening you know and is it any Wonder people like me fall victim to this that I I had all this surgery I tried to change because you know I I kind of felt victim to this mentality I'm an adult but you know these kids can't make these decisions on their own they're being pushed this radical agenda and I'm grateful that I've come out the other side I'm grateful I found God but you know I want to speak up for these kids that are confused with their gender a lot of kids have gender dysphoria and you know that wasn't a thing 20 years ago Tucker this is what's being taught in the school system so here's the thing everything that Ali London is saying is correct it's music to my ears it's obviously a lot of the work that we do here at the daily wire and trying to expose this nefarious agenda on our children don't exactly if I'm being honest I don't exactly like Ali London's character Arc I don't like that it goes from somebody completely unknown just some British guy completely unknown then decides I'm going to be a Korean woman gets all of this work done gets tons of attention and sponsorships and followers becomes an influencer and then six months later completely changes his mind and is now being on Tucker Carlson right he's now being featured on Tucker Carlson which is you know the biggest show in the United States my personal opinions is that what Ollie London is saying is true but also Ali London just wants attention that's my honest opinion I think that Ali London because he was unknown he fell victim to social media likes and clicks and saw that if you just pretended that you were gender dysphoric and pretended that you wanted to become a woman that you could get attention and he got that attention right he went through all these procedures people loved him he was an influencer being trans-racial got tons of headlines then all I wanted to realize you know what I'm doing this for attention I don't really want to be this how about I trans position and that will make another Splash into the conservative circles and that's exactly what he got attention and so this goes back to an earlier episode where we talked about your psychological immune system and how people are becoming more and more desperate online to get clicks and they're willing to do that if it means going under the knife they're also willing to do that if it means rejecting all the procedures that you got I do not think that Ali London is a stable individual that said I do think that having the discussion uh that discussion that's having on Twitter Carlson will do more good than it does harm all right guys the holiday season is upon us and I am excited it's my favorite time of year and I especially look forward to all the cooking and the baking a few of my favorite holiday dishes are mac and cheese and it's my grandma's recipe and it cannot

ranchers American Meat delivered moving on in case you did not see it you should go watch the full thing obviously we're not allowed to show you the entire monologue but Dave Chappelle absolutely wondrous on Saturday Night Live I think earlier there were some rumors that some writers were boycotting having him on based on some past commentary that he did regarding trans the trans agenda I don't know if that's true but if they did boycott it was in his favor of course because that means they were allowed to actually be funny uh he made fun of really the monologue was making fun of trump in a lighthearted way also supporting Trump in a in a light-hearted way and talking about the voters of Ohio he was making fun of Kanye and Kanye West but also kind of taking you know in a weird way kind of supporting him and people that are in Hollywood in the industry being called crazy so here is Dave Chappelle in his own words why you got all them documents in his house what is this this guy that's famous for not reading his press briefings now the sudden he got ten thousand documents [Music] I've been firing from jobs many times in my life and and I will be very honest with you sometimes I was fired I I stole things from the office State Blues computer mouses all kinds of stuff but you know what I never stole from work work again really funny super light-hearted and what I loved about it was that we kind of seem to be in this moment where everybody's walking on eggshells and he acknowledges that at the end he said it shouldn't be this difficult to talk about anything and we are feeling this squeeze on Comedy and this squeeze on humor and just so you know how consistent I have been on defending comedians Dave Chappelle notoriously took a shot at me because of my George Floyd video and I thought that he was actually quite disgusting in his comments toward me but my response publicly was not to condemn him but rather to say that comedian should be protected and then I was honored that he mentioned my name on stage back when that happened because it is true it was Jordan Peterson actually that one said a quote that the sign of a tyrant is somebody that kills the jester right if a king order suggested to be killed it's because he is a tyrant and they no longer allow jokes and hours Society is increasingly saying that jokes are not okay they came after him because it was trans comments even after this stand-up there were some groups that came after him and said that he reinforced anti-semitic tropes again anybody saying anything bad after a stand-up comedian should be viewed as a as a tyrant the purpose of his monologue was to bring people together it's exactly what I felt that he accomplished like I said he was both pro-trump and anti-trump he was both Pro Kanye and anti-kanye and it allowed people to laugh at themselves that is the purpose of comedians they are they force us to stop taking ourselves so seriously and to realize that we have more common and I just think that laughter is forever the best medicine and so I just wanted to commend him and what I thought was a wonderful 15-minute stand up go watch the entire thing if you have time today moving on AOC is a victim of what I do not know but I know she's always a victim and usually she's about to be killed from who nobody knows but she is always telling us that she's fearful for her life and she had an interview with Chris Wallace on CNN and she spoke about how the recent attack on Paul Pelosi has really heightened her concern that they're coming for her I don't know who we don't know who they are or why they're coming apart but they are coming for her and take a listen to AOC explain that to you I felt that my life has been in danger since the moment that um I won my primary election in 2018 and it became especially intensified when I was first brought into Congress in 2019. does it mean as you walk down the street as you go about your life that you this is something on your mind that you are looking over your shoulder what does it mean it means when I wake up in the morning I hesitate to walk my dog it means when I come home I have to ask my fiance to come out to where my car is to walk me to just from my car to my front door I mean bottom line is she's talking about how she feels and today's episode is about feelings and not facts So factually speaking nothing has happened to AOC to make her fearful she's not saying that she's gotten a threat she's not saying that any no person has ever approached her and yet despite there being an absence of facts she thinks that she has a right to be super annoying to her dog and her fiance I mean poor dogs like hey can you take me for a walk she's like no I'm scared why are you scared I don't know I just feel like I should be scared and they think of Beyonce could you imagine you're in the house and every single time your fiance gets out of the car they call you and like hey could you come walk me 10 feet to the door I'd be like no I don't want to do that every single day well I'm scared what are you scared for nobody knows I don't know why I'm scared I just feel that I should be scared in the same way that I felt that I almost died on January 6 when a bunch of grandmas stormed the Capitol building and I wasn't even in the Capitol building but I felt scared and I felt like I almost died and Ted Cruz almost killed me that's what she said when she said that Ted Cruz Ted Cruz almost killed her somehow nobody really understands but the point is that AOC feels like a victim perpetually she has not yet been able to explicate on that victimhood and we will continue to report on her forever developing story of why She's suffering and you need to realize it so if you follow me on

regarding the episode that I did last week which I directed toward black women who feel sometimes neglected by me but in reality I kind of shared with you the black women have been the meanest to me out of everybody in the universe in the twitterverse in the Instagram verse black women have kind of been the nastiest to me this woman writes her name is Regina she says Candace thank you for sharing your story I think more black people need to have these conversations about degrading and disrespecting each other when I was in school I was talked about by people who said they were my friends I was too black because my skin is very dark I was called Tar baby Lackey spook midnight and if I wore black I was said to be naked it was terrible and it was from black people it wasn't until I got into white spaces or around older black people that they told me that my skin was beautiful and I hated it because all I heard was that my skin was too black and I was ugly for being too black this is still going on today for others I meet so many dark-skinned girls who ask how did I gain confidence because they too hate their skin then I hear from lighter skinned women that they have been bullied for being light or called stuck up we have to do something better I appreciate you calling this out so true it like I said black women are the pettiest it's always about the way that we look and it's super nasty which is weird because then black women become the most vocal supporters of causes like BLM right and they constantly are offering this commentary on racism when in fact the people that I have found to be the most racist in my life are black people and the comments and the things that they say to me slave charms all the time and I just wonder who taught them to hate other black people in that regard and I think a lot of it has to do as I mentioned in last week's episode with culture of black women feeling like they need to be the purveyors of culture in some way so thanks for that comment another comment from sunshine and soul she writes I agree with you 100 I went to a most white high school where there was only one black table in the quad area that most black people hung out at during lunch my freshman year they decided that I wasn't black enough to hang out with them their reasoning I took honors classes I was a cheerleader I wore a Hollister and I talked white my family came to California from rural Mississippi and overcame so much racism and poverty to give me a better life I never understood why being educated speaking proper English and having different interests meant that I wasn't black enough being black to me has always meant being the best that I can be and not conforming to stereotypes but just being myself has unfortunately meant more times than not being rejected by my own people especially black women it is such a blessing to be able to see someone like me have such a huge and influential platform where you can show that being black means more than agreeing with the consensus and the ridiculous stereotypes God knows who has set in place you know like a breath of fresh air thanks for speaking up for the Oreos of the black community yeah the quote-unquote Oreos it's very true I don't know why it is that but when black people tend to speak proper English we get told that we're acting white which in my opinion is a form of racism it's saying that if you're smart if you take honors classes if you're doing well then that means that you're not black and that's a very very very scary idea to implant into children's mind that to be successful would mean that you're no longer allowed to have your skin tone so people are choosing between oh do I want to be smart do I want to read books do I want to become successful or do I want to fit in and be dumber and speak improper English and I don't again know who is behind that concept but it does feel at times more Sinister to me moving on you guys know that we covered the woman last week who put her fallopian Fallopian tubes into a necklace a very young woman I think she's like 22 or 23 years old John Campbell comments and he writes different take here I thank God that she did this it means that this narcissistic monster will never be able to murder an innocent baby I hope she fully convinced as many people like her to do the same if they regret it later on oh well actions have consequences I understand the sentiment there I completely understand thinking okay the problem is sort of taking care of itself and these people that are this insane and this motivated to hate their femininity that they're willing to remove their Fallopian tubes great they won't be able to reproduce but it makes me sad because I know that women at the tender age of 19 20 21 their brains are not fully developed and so it makes me sad knowing that she's made such a permanent decision that doctors have allowed this doctors who do have their brains fully developed parents who have their brain fully developed have allowed this to take place and then rather than trying to help her they've ruined her life and it makes me sad that she will wake up and be 28 and suddenly realize wait a second a kid having a child is what it's all about having a family is what it's all about and she took it from herself when she was so young because she fell in love with a Tick-Tock Trend really or wanted to be super radical and against the Supreme Court because a bunch of leftists told her that she was supposed to be upset so I think that as much as I understand your sentiment I still feel really sad for all of these young women because they're young women and they're not older next question regarding the trans man that won the Miss America Pageant Jim Payne writes imagine if you tried to enter your Persian cat into a dog show competition they wouldn't let you do it but imagine if they did and then your cat won the dog show that's essentially where we are at right now we want to show how enlightened we are we are actually just showing our own that is so true it's ridiculous thing to even conceive but of course Ridiculousness is all that we really are conceptualizing in this moment uh and I could totally see that my cat identifies as a dog and then people being virtuous like oh nobody knows if the cat is a dollar if the dog is a turtle only they know how they feel on the inside give this cat this kitty cat all the awards and if you like cats like I do the cat would be looking very much like these humans are so dumb and it really upsets me that I need to be here for this final comment this one is regarding Emily rajakowski giving her son a tea set and a doll because he loves trucks and she's got to make him more effeminate I guess that's what she says in her podcast D writes that was tortured to my ears listening to those women does Emily still recall her Blurred Lines video when she spews out all of these this hypocritical BS I think what she's referring to here is that obviously Emily rajkowski kind of Hit the scene when she was butt naked and had Robin Thicke dancing around her to Blurred Lines and she definitely was stepping into a stereotype of being a woman and being a woman that is lusted after it's kind of her brand to be honest so I guess she allows herself her Womanhood but wants to deprive her son her son's love for trucks or something I agree she is a hypocrite but I actually just think she's sad and you're gonna see her become more and more extreme for attention because she is now getting a divorce and she's going to need to somehow make people think that she's happy and she's going to lean into this radicalized version of feminism which of course is only going to make her more miserable alright guys next portion of the show show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Ivanka Trump cropping out Kimberly Guilfoyle in a photo from Tiffany Trump's wedding so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description to subscribe right now [Music]", "jIlsxa7pnMM": "it's Tuesday ladies and gentlemen so let's have some fun to get you through it question of the day today what is one conspiracy theory that you believe in I know there's one everybody gets pulled in by at least one plus I will be responding to some of the most insane comments I received following my monologue on Kanye's alleged anti-Semitism and one of the nation's top Children's Hospital is now claiming that some children know their gender identity in the womb yeah we're not crazy or anything all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] thank you so I asked you a question and that question was what is one conspiracy theory that you believe in because I know there's one there's just always the thing that you talk about in your house you're like I just feel like maybe the government is pulling the wool over our eyes a little bit so I'm going to tell you mine in the spirit of fun I promise you I actually talked to my husband about this I'm like there's just no way there's just no way so we were talking about the moon landing I don't know why that one always gets me I think it's because it was in 1969 and to think about where technology was during 1969 and then to Envision that we somehow landed on the moon and took a casual walk then gets a little bit stranger of course because not only did we take a casual walk on the moon but then we had a casual phone call right you have Neil Armstrong who just called down and was like hey what's up everybody I'm on the moon and then of course it was the live television aspect not only did he call down from the Moon but everybody was able to watch it all over the world and then when he came back NASA accidentally lost all of that original footage just like okay sorry uh we we keep this we kept us all in a vault but now it's all gone and we can't actually look back and examine all of that original footage to be clear NASA searched for but could not locate some of the original Apollo 11 data tapes original in the sense that they directly recorded data transmitted from the Moon an intensive search of the archives and Records concluded that the most likely scenario was that the program managers determined there was no longer a need to keep the tapes since all the video and data was recorded elsewhere and they were erased and then reused I know just it's just it sits weird with me and then if you go back and you watch Neil Armstrong's interviews he doesn't seem like he even knows that he was out there he's just really awkward maybe he's an awkward guy in general but he's just really awkward the astronauts have no feedback in fact even and I know obviously this is fiction but even on Netflix's the crown they did an entire episode on this and it was around Prince Philip being so excited to host the astronauts and then in conclusion being really let down by how not amazing they were and how they really gave him no interesting feedback about what they saw this amazing feat for Humanity and then these astronauts are just like yeah man we did it so it gets me that one gets me just a little bit and when I was saying this to my husband he actually said something that smacked me down a little bit I think it was a good rebuttal he brought up Concord Jets he said actually this isn't the first time that technology has gone backwards he said think about in general during that time you used to have Concord Jets do you guys even know about Concord Jets because when I brought this up to my production team some of them had no idea what I was talking about there used to be a jet that carried passengers from New York all the way to London in under three hours that's unimaginable I mean I obviously frequent London a lot because that's where my husband's from and that trip takes if you're going from New York all the way to London about seven hours but there used to be in the early 70s in 1973 they launched a passenger jet that it would take you just under three hours to do that trip and so my husband's father who used to travel to New York for work used to be able to leave London arrive same day in New York just a couple of hours later for breakfast and then make it back home to London all within the same day I mean that's crazy faster than you could get to Los Angeles you could just go to London and it wasn't just that route they also had an Air France route it wasn't just British Airways that did it it was Air France that did it and you used to be able to go all the way from France to Washington Dulles airport in the same quick time frame so what happened how is it plausible now that we have passenger jets that are going slower than they were going in 1973 which is when it began and they stopped it they retired these jets in 2003 following an Air France accident that happened on one of these Jets which by the way had nothing to do with the manufacturing of the Jets themselves it was an Air France passenger jet and because of debris that was on the runway when they took off it basically the entire jet tripped and the tire got caught in the engine and there was a huge explosion and all passengers all 109 passengers on board plus some people that were in a nearby Hotel perished and after that they said oh we have to we have to stop and they just retired the jet in 2003 seems like a very bizarre thing right we know now that even horrifyingly that these passenger Jets have accidents even the ones that we have today and yet this one was retired why so yeah I thought that was a very good rebuttal that my husband gave me and said okay that's just a conspiracy against actually there are so many different areas in which technology has gone backwards and then it led me to ask myself the question is society going forward in any regard think about it what in what way would you say that from the 1970s to today Society has moved forward we have become better and we have become stronger and we have become smarter I've already painted the example of how we are going backwards in terms of travel what's another area what's another category phones right you might say oh okay let's look at the cell phone obviously that has LED society and Humanity forward no I would rebut and I would say actually our phones are enslaving us and because of our phones we have less capable human beings we can't do anything social media has sent Humanity backwards right you might say oh well can I say listen at least we live in a society that has more racial Harmony since the 70s I beg to differ look around you yeah we're being painted a picture we keep calling it progress but obviously we are digressing we are actually having to argue and explain to people why it's wrong to put in place policies at disadvantage white people and that disadvantaged Asian people for example the education system now we have something called affirmative action which means that if you're a black person and let's say you have a 2-0 a 2.0 GPA in high school you're going to get into a college ahead of a white person or an Asian person who might have a 2.7 GPA because they're black I guess that's not progress that's actually just saying it's upside down land and we used to be racist towards these people but now we're going to be rated towards these other people might say well women's rights so obviously since the 70s women's rights obviously know women's rights are also facing a catastrophe and we are going backwards we used to want to be on equal footing with men now we are suddenly saying we want nothing to do with men and we are tearing families apart all in the name of progress right all in the name of progress so what actually today in society is moving forward I'm asking you this question I don't have the answer I want you to actually comment and give me feedback and say well Candice in this one regard we are moving forward because the only answer that I could come up with is that our government is moving forward our government has amassed a lot of power during this time our government of course is still using these Sonic Boom Jets we know that our military has these tools we know that our military is using this technology which gives gives our government more power and of course going back to the women's rights movement which I say is causing us on a personal level on a household level to digress the government is moving forward because of the absence of strong households and in the absence of strong families you instead have a strong State a strong state that is stepping in and saying we will be your family we will be we will create the Department of Education we will raise your kids to think in a manner that guarantees us more power in the future because they turn to the state for Solutions the same for the alleged racial Harmony which is nowhere if you're looking around obviously we've gone backwards it's volatile of course that gives the state more power because the state tells you that it needs to offer Solutions and it's Solutions of course are things that just create more division it just creates more government it just creates more departments and compartments of government that we need to deal with the never-ending racial strife so no I would say government is not doing us any favors by growing itself the individual is shrinking as the government grows and that's all I have to say about that all right guys before we continue I want to take a quick second to

[Music] thank you first up Ben Shapiro needs to come get his girl I guess that's me the reason why I say that is because in case you forgot uh one day I was having a back fourth with Megan McCain on Twitter about kovid where she was one of the people that were super scared of cobit and could not understand how any person in their sane mind did not get the vaccine and what's wrong with these anti-vaxxers uh that being me I did not get the vaccine and I basically explained to her that actually clinical obesity which is a fact is something that is concerning if you have covid which I do not have and she was very upset and she tweeted this at me she said come get your girl at Ben Shapiro wait what what it was one of the weirdest things I've ever come get your girl Ben Shapiro but I realized this is now becoming a theme since I work at the daily wire people just randomly say Ben Shapiro come get your girl like he's my father or something and that I have to I guess agree with everything he says or he has to agree with everything that I say pretty sure they didn't want me to work of a daily wire so that I could be a black Ben Shapiro by the way picturing a black Ben Shapiro was just weird in general but boy yesterday was a come get your girl Ben Shapiro kind of day so I did a totally sane mono monologue regarding Kanye West's tweets which were confusing to anybody who saw them I don't know what death Con 3 is I said I literally don't know what it is I know what Defcon 3 is I don't know who he was talking about I didn't know if he was talking about a specific person who was Jewish none of it made any sense to me but I definitely did not read the tweet and think that Kanye West was going to organize a military strike in Israel I know that the web is emotional and that we all have to be really extreme in our reactions but I basically said that Kanye should clarify what he meant before everyone got hysterical but you know we live in a world where you're not allowed to clarify what you mean and nobody waits for you to clarify what you mean instead they just castigate you they tell you that you're this or you're that you're racist you're transphobic you're anti-semitic nobody wants to hear any more from you ever again well Tanya's a friend of mine and I actually want to hear what he has to say and I would like him to further explicate but this was not enough for the internet no no no in fact they did exactly what I said that they love to do and they stripped essentially a minute out of my 15-minute monologue and said Janice is defending Kanye West in fact this was a headline in the Jerusalem Post they ran this headline Candice Owens defends Kanye West says tweets about Jews wasn't anti-Semitic okay interesting though is that buried beneath in their article they actually clearly literally this is like one of the last few lines they actually clearly said at the end of this article quote Owens stressed that her statements are not a defense of his tweets but an open question which never seems to happen anymore oh okay so doesn't that completely go against your headline you say at the very bottom of this article that I stressed that I was not defending him but you went with the headline which was hysterical Candace Owens defends Kanye West nope I did not defend Kanye West not even once I just said I'd like further clarification about what he meant because I know him and I know that he has tons of Jewish friends I actually met him through his best friend who is Jewish they reached out to me and said hey I'm best friends with Kanye West and I'd love to get you two in touch so it didn't make sense to me that people wanted me to say that he suddenly wanted audition to die but of course this is now not Kanye's fault when you tweet it it's not Candace's fault what she tweeted or what she said in her monologue but it is Ben Shapiro's fault ah yeah a person a person actually tweeted this and I just wanted to read it this is from Ari cross Ari cross is totally a stable human being and he wrote I'm pretty sure that by tomorrow Ben Shapiro there has to get Candice to say sorry I was on Ambien at the time or fire her I'm gonna go with that hey guys I just wanted to say I'm sorry that in yesterday's monologue I was on Ambien I was I just I took three ambient pills and I did this crazy monologue where I said that we should wait before we react and get clarification so I hope that makes you happy Ari and I I just wanted to say that in case you didn't think that was an insane response I went onto my Instagram and I was tagged in a tweet so somebody was pasting a tweet onto Instagram and the Tweet said so death Con 3 I still don't know what death Con 3 is against the Jews then question mark damn bigots you don't quit and this was in response to learning that there is still conflict obviously between Jews and Palestinians in the region and a girl actually wrote to me she tagged me and she says it seems like this was the desired outcome that you were both looking for am I right and she is talking about the Israeli Palestinian conflict which has been going on forever and I guess now it is the outcome that I was looking for when I said that we should ask Kanye to clarify what death conifery means and what he actually meant by these tweets so I guess now I'm responsible it's me I the re the entire reason in case you didn't know if you were like I'm actually don't know what's going on that region it's because Candace wants to wait for Kanye to clarify his tweet that is the reason that Israel and Palestine have been in conflict with each other it's me I'm the I'm the girl you're looking for Ben Shapiro come get yo girl you know I have to say what I found to be really ironic here in reading all of these insane tweets and blaming me for the entire conflict is they essentially were accusing me of anti-Semitism by association while at the same time saying that I I work for him and controlled by Ben Shapiro right so you're accusing me of being anti-semiticize anti-semitic why would I work for Ben Shapiro does that not at all in your brain register as a conflict of interest if you're anti-semitic if you hate Jews why would you work for Ben Shapiro and then the funny thing is by saying Ben Shapiro come get your girl or saying Ben Shapiro come control Candace Owens you are actually aren't you giving into a racist Trope that Jews control the world isn't that a racist Trope Ben Shapiro come control Candace Owens isn't aren't you doing exactly what you are accusing other people of doing why would Ben Shapiro need to get me under control that makes absolutely no sense as I said before we have different opinions and we have different strategies when it comes to certain things so I don't I actually don't know what Ben's response was to Kanye's tweets because I gave you my own which is that they made entirely no sense to me I want clarification and then I also think by the way drop this all up that it's really funny that people were very upset with Kanye because they felt that he was blaming Jewish people right when he spoke out about Jared Kushner when he tweeted about Jewish people and death Con 3 they felt that he was arbitrarily blaming Jewish people which is a racist historical Trope well um what are you doing when you blame Ben Shapiro for what I say so this entire thing happened and you're basically saying this is the fault of a Jewish person Ben Shapiro yeah guys you're not making any sense and I stand by every single word that I send in my monologue which was completely level-headed and I know that we live in a society where we can't extend Grace anymore and we can't seek Clarity but I'm not playing any of your games it's just not who I am I'm not going to fall for the ism game which is what I call it when you just call people racist sexist homophobic misogynist and you demand a hysterical response I'm pretty immune to that because you've done it to me so many times moving on somebody that was able to speak whose voice I don't know if I've ever heard I think maybe just in the Oprah interview before his wife spoke over him but Prince Harry spoke yesterday and it does it feels like a rare act he just has let Meghan Markle do all the Talking she's now had a podcast it's like she is his PR agent and she tells you why his family sucks and she does it like every month and then she also tells you that the only reason they left was because they wanted their privacy and so they moved into Hollywood which is not the not the area that I would recommend the neighborhood that I would recommend if you want your privacy I also wouldn't recommend having a podcast if you want your privacy but Prince Harry has actually spoke he spoke to the winners of the 2022 well child Awards which is a charity that celebrates the inspirational quality of the UK's seriously ill children along with those who go that extra mile to make a difference to their lives here is Prince Harry I'll tell you what we all need a we only need a dog that keeps us calm I've got I've got three in this house now so we basically have five children um I've got a black labrador called uh Pooler a rescue beagle called guy and we got another rescue beagle called uh Mia um and between the three of them um they charge around chasing squirrels and causing all sorts of problems to us every single day they are but they are also emotional emotional support dogs 100 I mean I'm you know one of my biggest pet peeves is emotional support dogs but I think he's he just comes across as likable and I don't know how it's possible that he's so likable and Megan is just seems to be the exact opposite which brings me to her podcast she recently released a new episode where she says that she's been labeled as crazy and hysterical and nuts and insane although she doesn't actually say who said that and she also says that she feels pretty strongly about the word crazy and that families have been Shattered by its use take a listen I'm Megan and this is archetypes my podcast about the labels and tropes that try to hold women back I feel pretty strongly about this word this label crazy it's thrown around so casually and the Damage it's brought on society and women frankly everywhere from relationships to families being shattered reputations destroyed and careers ruined stigma surrounding the word if it also has this silencing effect this effect where women experiencing real mental health issues they get scared they stay quiet they internalize and they repress for far too long look there's a lot to unpack here so she says stigma around the word crazy has a silencing effect I challenge that notion because clearly she says that she's been called crazy and she's definitely not been silent at all despite what she would have you believe she keeps pretending that she's being in prison and nobody's allowing her to speak I just want to say also in general this sounds like the worst podcast ever I just don't understand people that think leaning into this victim mentality is something that people want to hear especially nowadays it's just it's it's just old it's just aged nobody wants to hear how oppressed you are as a princess it just doesn't make any sense and I do think actually I read a really interesting piece in the Daily Mail where they talked about this weird environment or this weird place that Harry and Megan are in now because they don't really know how to make money right their entire brand is talking about their own victimhood and they've kind of signed a deal with the Devil read to Spotify you know I think that the deal was something like 25 million dollars and they agreed to this deal thinking that they were going to do something productive and healthy but in reality what Spotify wants is blood they want them to continue to trash the royal family and they seem a little less willing to do that now especially following Queen Elizabeth II's death they don't seem like they want to give that but they have no other use in society Megan was never a great actress nobody knew who she was before she got with Prince Harry which graded her access to the parties that she wanted Grant granted her access to the billionaires that she wants to be around like Oprah but how is she going to make her money Oprah's talented Oprah is a had was an incredible talk show host she owns a network she's very good when she gives these interviews she knows how to get people to give her the information that she wants what is the talent that Harry and Megan have because I don't care how far left you are I don't care how anti-family you are or how much you despise the nuclear family or the concept of a royal family that isn't actually by the way have any real power they are not an absolute monarch over in the UK despite the depictions that Megan and Harry have given to society no matter how far left you are you just become a little bit uncomfortable when somebody's entire brand and the only way that they make money is by denigrating their family they're going to have to come up with a new plan moving on I want to talk about this Planned Parenthood cartoon ad yup Planned Parenthood is under Fire not because they've aborted millions and millions of babies and have ripped them a limb from limb from their mother's womb no they've never been under Fire for that but they're under Fire for a cartoon ad that teaches teenagers different ways of delaying their puberty some of which they say works like a stop sign you can just stop your puberty one of the ways is through the use of puberty blockers which can halt voice deepening facial hair growth and menstrual cycles the organization posts the video to its YouTube account in January but it's recently resurfaced on The Eye Inside the classroom Twitter account take a listen there's no one-size-fits-all puberty experience if you're trans intersex or non-binary know that you're not the only one feeling confused for some intersex people puberty may start later than age 14. you might experience some of puberty's changes and not others and your body may or may not go through puberty on its own there are medicines you can take to help your body start the process like hormone replacement therapy some people decide on hormones or surgeries to help their bodies match up to their gender identity or how they feel inside about themselves your gender identity is real you should be the one to decide what changes you want to make to your body if you're transgender or non-binary you may find that your puberty experiences don't line up with your gender identity or how you see yourself that feeling can be uncomfortable scary and stressful if that sounds like you know that you're not alone there are medicines you can take to delay puberty for a while they're called puberty blockers and they work like a stop sign by holding the hormones testosterone and estrogen that cause puberty changes like facial hair growth and periods puberty blockers are safe and can give you more time to figure out what feels right for you your body and your gender identity you don't have to have all of the answers right now so remember it's all a work in progress and it may take time to figure out what feels right to you but talking to a trusted adult and a nurse or doctor may help want to learn more go to plannedparenthood.org teens it's just positively despicable I mean there is no question that Planned Parenthood is a death cult it is they are they are a death organization they specialize in death that's what they do they tell people that they shouldn't have families they abort children from the womb of their mothers I just can't imagine that this organization is still being funded by people and now they are turning their attention to teenagers and trying to get them to destroy their bodies so that they can never become reproductive human beings that's the game right actually we won't even have to perform an abortion on you because you're not going to be able to become pregnant you are you're going to be rendered infertile how brilliant is that for Planned Parenthood to realize right because now that conservatives are once again winning on the pro-life organic pro-life movement which by the way is sad that we had to win on a movement that supports life that supports families that supports birth now that we have finally won that argument and sent that argument back down to the States to be voted on again they're going what can we do what can we do and their answer is to make sure that human beings just can't procreate Target the teenagers Target them and say oh you can just stop your puberty don't worry by the way we're not going to tell you that these uh hormone therapy and these puberty blockers are actually used to castrate pedophiles in prison I'm not going to tell you that we're not going to tell you that if you're a male and you take these for a long time you're going to develop a micropenis and you are actually not going to have any sexual desire you take this for long enough you're not even going to be able to have productive sexual relationships when you become an adult you're actually probably going to fall into a deep deep depression when you realize this when you realize that adults lied to you when you realize that doctors lie to you when you realize that you were intentionally confused intentionally targeted by an entire ecosystem of evil an ecosystem that is happening in the classrooms an ecosystem that is happening on social media where they permit these lies to be told and spread around the world and an ecosystem that ends up really in a hospital room when children are confused about why their bodies don't work the way that they're supposed to because they were given Credence to an idea that is a lie no you cannot pick your gender no you cannot halt your puberty like a stop sign these are incredibly Sinister organizations and people that support this and I'm glad that Planned Parenthood is having their day in the public courtroom and people are starting to realize what this organization has always been about which is death speaking of a Sinister ecosystem we can hardly mention that without talking about hospitals hospitals I don't know when they became prison Wars or when they started focusing on harming patients but we are definitely there one of the nation's top Children's Hospitals has generated controversy over a video claiming that some children know their gender identity before they are born that's so isn't that can I just pause there it's a remarkable so we are being told that they're not human beings which is why it's totally fine that Planned Parenthood is aborting millions and millions and millions of them right it's totally fine that we're harvesting organs doesn't even matter because they're not real but also they know their gender identity those not real things that are in your stomach know the gender identity yep Boston Children's Hospital posted a video on its YouTube channel in August where a psychologist explains that a good portion of children she sees at the hospital's gender multi-specialty service Clinic whatever that is they know their gender identity from the womb Yep this is the video you should take a listen so most of the patients that we have in the gems Clinic actually know their gender usually around the age of puberty but a good portion of children do know as early as seemingly from the womb and they will usually Express their gender identity as very young children some as soon as they can talk they might say phrases such as I'm a girl or I'm a boy or I'm going to be a woman or I'm going to be a mom kids know very very early so in the gems Clinic we see a variety of young children all the way down to ages two and three and usually up to the ages of nine when they come into the clinic they'll see one of our psychologists and we'll be talking to them about their gender we'll be talking to their family about how to best support that child and how to make sure that that child has the space and support to explore their gender and do well throughout their development and we'll be answering any parent questions a lot of parents do have questions and so we answer those questions the biggest piece of advice I give parents who are coming through the gender Clinic at Boston Children's Hospital is to just be supportive sometimes you might not understand sometimes you feel like you don't know the terms or you don't kind of get exactly what the child means when they say that they might be this gender her but the biggest thing you can do is just love your child and support them and just allow them to express themselves that's the biggest protector as well against negative mental health effects such as depression suicidality anxiety that we worry about for our gender diverse kids and young adults so that support from a parent is one of the best protective factors and one of the best things they can do I almost have no words for this I really just want to say that I hope that in watching and paying attention to this what we have done is played a part in waking parents up I just I just hope parents are now realizing just how evil this world has become and how focused this world this state if you will because what's really happening is over governance and statism I hope that people are realizing that the new Target is children that it has to be children to accomplish whatever the state's goals are which are always anti-family they need to focus on the Next Generation coming up they need to strip children of their identity in order to turn them into Bots and to State slaves right and they know this is exactly what will happen if you destroy the human being if you destroy the things that our our souls naturally desire and strive toward like family there is nothing that makes people feel more whole than actually accomplishing having a family than going home at the end of the day like I get to do and sitting down with your family having a meal with your family talking about your day the joy that comes from having children a children's laugh right the pitter patter of children's feet when they run in the morning the state doesn't want that for you and what they're doing is they are poisoning your children they're poisoning your children to hate family so much that they will sacrifice their own bodies right they will sacrifice their own bodies not even knowing it in fact that what they're doing is just selling them an idea you're going to feel better all you got to do is take these pills and get rid of your body parts ruin your body parts in some regards sometimes it's just taking the pill sometimes it's going the extra mile and getting these surgeries that permanently deform children because these are cosmetic procedures they're not going to actually change what you are you are either a male or you are a female but this new Focus these radical videos and convincing children that they knew they had the ability to know that they weren't this even when they were in the womb that's all an effort to give the state more power because these kids are going to be to become permanent Wards of the big Pharma States and they're going to have to turn to the state to deal with their medical bills that will become insurmountable they will forever be in debt they will forever be depressed they'll forever be looking for the next pill the next injection that's going to make it all better and it's never going to it's never going to make it better and that's all I have to say about that all right

gonna take a look back at some of our best candice show moments from seasons one and two and in this episode we are revisiting my interview with kyle rittenhouse you guys will remember cal rittenhouse that was a trial that seized america a young teenager really fighting for his life and there was a lot riding on this and he was at long last declared not guilty being able to sit down with kyle and to just allow him to speak and humanize himself despite all the rhetoric being called the white supremacist despite the fact that he had only killed white people and it truly was in self-defense his experience with the media and what his life has been since the verdict is he gonna sue anybody these were questions that were on everybody's minds and i got the answers take a listen the kyle rittenhouse trial completely gripped the nation in august of 2020 violent protests broke out in kenosha wisconsin in the wake of the non-fatal police shooting of jacob blake britton house who was 17 at the time joined a group of men to protect the community and local businesses from being destroyed acting in self-defense britain house killed two people and wounded a third after being violently attacked now of course the mainstream media and even our own sitting president smeared his name calling him a white supremacist and a violent vigilante after one of the most highly publicized trials in our country's history justice was served and kyle was acquitted of all charges today he is a free man and he is here to tell his story in person please help me welcome kyle rainhouse so excited oh yeah so excited to have you obviously your entire story gripped the nation gripped me i was just like live watching this stuff and just so fired up i think because something that i've noticed just tends to be a thing that happens in america is during election time they kind of find one case the media and they just kind of get their talent in it um and they're never honest about that case and it's just kind of to make people very emotional about certain topics that seem to feed political narratives of the day this one particularly rubbed me the wrong way because you were a minor you're 17 years old before we get into the case i want to talk about who you are as a person like who was kyle rittenhouse before he was the kyle in house of america well before this happened who i was was i was just a normal 17 year old kid i would go hang out with friends i would go hang out at car meets i'd go to the beach i was just a goofy regular kid who just like wanted to help people i was a lifeguard i was a swim instructor and i was a firefighter emt cadet and a police explorer so i just wanted to help people before this and i still want to help people and that's just who i was that's who i was as a person right and it must be just i i have to imagine you have some ptsd because it's like you're just a normal kid living his life and you know suddenly you're going to help people um in a place that your father lives you know just making sure businesses aren't getting destroyed when for whatever reason people the media narrative was you can loot and destroy any place you want in the wake of a black lives matter protest um tell me what it was like the moment after that the night took place what were your first instincts after you know you realized that this was going to be a case that somebody was dead even running you know running for your life there's so much to process in that moment well it's it's been hard i definitely have had some nightmares waking up at night with cold sweats um but it i didn't realize how big the case actually was until like a few months later because i wasn't focused on that i was just like why is this happening i defended myself and i was there to help people and then i noticed all these false media narratives coming out calling me a white supremacist a vigilante and there's and those just aren't true how bizarre to be called a white supremacist when no black people were harmed or killed on this night like how bizarre that that was what they went with it's absolutely crazy because this case had nothing to do with race had to do with the right to self-defense and i just i just don't know where that narrative came from i mean they had nothing and there was just it just they just said this person is white therefore he is a white supremacist and it's got to be weird what was the community response because obviously you go home you have friends you know you've grown up with these people they know who you are do they rally behind you or do they sort of go no this narrative is right this kid this kid's a horrible person i didn't lose any friends over this because they know who i am as a person they know i'm not a racist person i love to hear that but your friends just stayed by your side throughout this entire process and i just didn't lose any friends and they continued to support me because they knew the facts and they knew who i was as a person as a human as a working mother i take advantage of every opportunity to save time and money and if you're following me on instagram you know that i love to cook for my

silk glove invasion is a silk love Invasion that is the political term I'd like to focus on today plus there is a story involving a very shady money trail that leads right to George soros's front door as usual I want to make sure that you are paying attention to that and did you know that Washington Colorado Oregon Vermont and California have all quietly begun to legalize composting human remains

to get three months free visit expressionpn.com Candace to learn more all right so the question that I asked you earlier is do you know what a silk glove invasion is and the reason I asked you that is because I was watching a television show I want to defend myself first and foremost I do not consume a lot of Television I watched this series because it was in the middle of covid shutdowns and I actually was very interesting the concept of it was very interesting so the show is entitled occupied it's on Netflix and it's about a futuristic energy crisis the plot line is essentially the whole constant of Europe is facing an energy crisis and they are oil dependent and they're dependent on Norway to access it so they need Norway essentially to open up the pipelines to the rest of your Europe but but but despite the crisis despite the fact that the Europeans need them to turn on the pipelines the prime minister is pro-green energy he just does not think that's the right thing to do and he decides to instead halt oil production because of his commitment to environmentalism of course that seems like it could really happen today not even during a crisis is he willing to break his green commitment and he just says so what Norway is a Sovereign Nation and we have decided that oil is a thing of the past so what happens you would think that that would be fine because Norway is a Sovereign Nation but not really because of bureaucracy so what happens in this futuristic fiction is that they and I'm talking about the European Union call upon Russia to Stage a silk glove invasion of Norway essentially they're going to force them to produce oil for the rest of the European continent while the Norwegians remain completely ignorant to the fact that the government has been completely taken over by Russia they do this pretty much in the first episode it gets going I'm not these are no spoilers but they kidnap the Prime Minister and they begin to threaten him and he is forced to then make policy and enact enact policy rather against his will so essentially he becomes just a puppet in office he exists to do the bidding of the Russians and the European Union he's a hostage and his role is just to convince the masses that even though they're all sensing that something's wrong there's a lot of Russians that are present he's meant to convince them that no no no no everything is fine business as usual he's in many ways gaslighting the Norwegian people right everything is fine we're working towards International Solutions I know I've reversed on the screen energy stuff but it's all going to be fine it's going to be great of course the reality of their circumstances is that the nation really has no sovereignty um he's just doing the bidding of the European Union and all of these bureaucrats because they've grown so powerful that Norway cannot withstand them I was thinking about this series because it so much of the reason why it's sent to shiver down my spine is it because it reminds me of America today in a weird way like we have all of these seemingly virtuous veneers in present-day American society but we all also have this suspicion that something's not right we look at President Biden in that same vein he looks like a puppet in office we know he has no real power and yet we continue to be gaslit by the mainstream media this is your president here's what he asked to say oh I know that he doesn't do any interviews and even in the very rare interviews that he grants he seems to be controlled it's almost as if he's gotten all of the questions in advance yeah we know he does actually get the questions in advance because we've seen him during press conferences which we shouldn't even call them that holding pieces of paper which with large font telling him who to call on it's it's like we're in a show it's like we have become a Netflix series it's like we are that futuristic plot line what's going on and at the same regard we're waking up and we're asking even deeper questions to ourselves we're asking how long has America not been free right it almost seems like the concept of Freedom was some hallucinogenic effect that we had right we thought this is the land of the free and then we wake up today and we're realizing we don't even necessarily have autonomy over our own bodies we're having to go to the Supreme Court to argue that we should have a right to put vaccines into our bodies when did that happen here it's almost as if it's been a long-running false assumption the land of the free the Land of the home of the brave the land of the free so to be clear a silk love invasion is one that occurs slowly and politely through a ton of bureaucracy you're given a bunch of half truths and the media misrepresents things to you but especially it happens because of bureaucracy which makes me think about our education system right it feels that in America there has been a silk glove Invasion it was polite and we didn't know it was happening I suppose when I think about it it must have happened beginning in the 1970s with the Department of Education at the exact same time that the Department of Education came into place you had a radicalized feminist movement that was vocal right this wave of feminism that insisted that having equality with men wasn't enough that we needed to go be men right that it was a bad thing for women to stay at home that the idea of a stay-at-home mom was backwards and belonged to the patriarchy so instead women had to Aspire to corporate goals women had to go out and get jobs and they should have aspired to climb the corporate ladder and so what has happened well of course at home because of that emptiness something has a rose to fill its place and that something is a Department of Education that something is the state that was the Silk glove Invasion now we are having parents that have to show up at school board meetings to fight right they're essentially having to fight and say no I don't want my child to be masked no I do not like these books that are in the classroom no I don't want my child to be taught that they can pick their gender no I don't want this overt sexually sexualization that is happening in these textbooks now a sudden moms are and dads are having to show up at these school board meetings to debate to debate rather than the Department of Education having to recognize that no we are the parents and we are in control when did that happen when did we see that power that's a silk glove Invasion another example of course which we all just recently experienced this big Pharma when did that happen when did it suddenly become necessary for us to speak to our employers about what vaccines we were taking when did it become a circumstance where I have to debate with the nurses and the doctors to be able to leave the hospital with my child when did parents start feeling pressure from the pharmacy industry from the pharmaceutical industry saying oh well okay you can choose obviously you're free to choose not to vax your children but just know that they might not be able to go to school if you do that and then you might think okay well then maybe I'm just not going to have my child go to school but nope the state still has control they can then threaten to take your children away if you don't enroll them into the school system all of that under the guise of things that were supposed to be good right it's about the health of your child we can't we the states care about your child more than you do we the state know what's the best for your child and we allowed that to happen once again we allowed big Pharma to take place grow to this insurmountable power within our nation because we just assumed I don't know if the government had our best interest at heart another example of what feels like a silk love invasion is the Department of Justice I mean what the hell is going on there who's running it you have President Biden who is reading cue cards telling us that he had no idea that Mar-A-Lago was going to be invaded by the FBI he had no idea what do you mean you have no idea the Department of Justice not a branch of government what do you mean I thought the FBI reports to you who's running the show there when did American families become the sought-after terrorists right it was all fun and games when we were all on the same page and we were taught that we needed to be fearful of the Middle East we were taught that we needed to be scared after 9 11 of terrorism that was going to take place on airplanes and so we gave up a lot of our freedoms a lot of our rights for a little bit of safety we thought right it was all fun and games and all of these departments were created the department of homeland's secure of Homeland Security follow me 911 and now we're going wait a minute now those departments are looking at us they are looking at us and they are saying you are the threat actually we have the Department of Justice looking at households and deciding that according to how you vote the opinions that you have according to whether or not you believe that your children should be indoctrinated God forbid you show up to these school board meetings that is a form of domestic terrorism you are the problem when did that start is it all recent or has it been going on for decades and we just weren't paying attention because that's what happens when it's a silk Club Invasion you're not paying attention because it feels polite well I think now it is in fact time that all of us begin paying attention that's all I have to say about that okay before we continue I want to take a quick pause to talk to you about the app hallow you all know that my faith is super important to me my relationship with God is how I find my strength and peace in this crazy world with all of the insane anti-religious ideologies that are being pushed by the left on a daily basis it can be hard to tune out the noise remember what we know is good and true which is why I love hallow hallow is a number one Christian Prayer app in the United States and the number one Catholic app in the world it's rooted in the Catholic tradition but an amazing resource for any Christian looking to dive deeper into their prayer life this is perfect for my family because as most of you know I am in a mixed Faith household my husband is devout Catholic and I am Protestant hallow has prayers and meditations to guide you throughout your entire day morning tonight some of the most popular prayers include the daily Rosary Gospel reading and daily Psalm with Bishop Barron plus there are minute meditations meditations for sleep and and kids prayers and meditations hallow helps me sleep better lower my anxiety levels and find peace and calm throughout the day and I think it will do the same for you so try it for three months free at hello.com Candace that's hello.com Candace reclaim your piece and download hello today okay now it's time for some topics du jour [Music] thank you all right when I think of a silk glove Invasion I think of the CDC I think of the FDA I think of all of these unelected bureaucrats I also think of big tech for sure talking about the First Amendment you can hardly do so without speaking about big attack I also think of ngos of course non-governmental organizations pouring money into various causes and you cannot talk about ngos without bringing up George Soros and I know this is a part of the show when all of his goons at Media Matters were oh my God I can't yes because their move here by the way which is ridiculous they say that if you talk about George Soros and he's got a long trail of funding all of these groups that are doing terrible things to America it's I mean it is abundantly obvious that he wants to spell the end of America and he's gonna he's got the money to do so right but when you talk about him they say oh he's Jewish and you're not allowed to say that about him what it's nothing to do with his Judaism bad people call come from all different faiths and from all different races and from all different genders George Soros happens to be a bad individual so why don't you put that in your media matter headline this uh first article that we have activists are suing DeSantis over the Martha's Vineyard tobacco now to bring you up to date on this I'm sure you're watching it because it's glorious and you should be watching this all unfold it's amazing I'm also going to insert myself into the Saga as you guys very well remember back in April of this year I notoriously tweeted that we should ship the illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard I said this in response to my friend Jack pesobic on Twitter who said that it didn't seem to be working to send them into inner cities and I think that's by the way a very smart thing that Governor Abbott is doing but when I saw that policy decision I said to myself if you really want to ruffle some feathers and get a quick reaction don't send them to inner cities they're happy to they've already given all of the inner cities all around America up to Crime they're like totally fine with that they're like here's crime doesn't really matter but just imagine a world in which all of those millions of illegal immigrants that are coming over the Border were dropped off in I don't know Martha's Vineyard so I tweeted that don't know can't say for sure after Santa's office saw it but I think we can say for sure that they saw it because they did it they sent them off to Martha's Vineyard and they went insane they got them off of the island in 44 hours and then gave these ridiculous quotes to the mainstream Media news and they just said oh we just were so for the time period that we had them here they enriched the community we just loved having them here it was amazing but also here are your bags and you need to leave and they made them leave and uh that's amazing and of course Los Angeles has said we're not stopping here he only sent 50. this is only 50 illegal migrants into Martha's Vineyard and this was their reaction they called to a humanitarian crisis and called in the National Guard to escort them off of the island and he's not done and so of course liberal activists and I very much put that into quotations uh because I don't I don't know what they're after here they have decided to assist these people who have been here uh they just got here but they already need to know their rights and they're going to sue DeSantis because they're trying to repackage this as human trafficking they're saying that DeSantis is trafficking humans throughout the United States by the way spoiler alert that's exactly what Biden was doing he was doing these flights if you'll recall he was putting illegal migrants and basically flying them over into Republican states we don't know why but he was doing that and it got unveiled but they have decided that you can send them anywhere you want especially into Republican territory but God forbid it's Martha's Vineyard so who do you think is behind it I said this on Backstage without even knowing the answer uh last week I said oh obviously I'm sure it's George Soros because everywhere uh that there seems to be a bad initiative on the left George soros's money is funding it and it turns out that that is true so it is George soros's Network which is entitled Alianza Americas that gave 1.3 million dollars and they have launched a class action lawsuit against DeSantis filed by lawyers for civil rights so the activist group at the center of the class action lawsuit against Governor Ron DeSantis and other Florida officials for the migrant flights to Martha's Vineyard have received nearly 1.4 million dollars from his open Society Network the sorosis open Society Network you'll see me talk about that in the black lives matter documentary which is going to be coming out soon entitled George Floyd the greatest lie ever sold but anyways back to George Soros who loves to give dollars to things that's spelled the end of America for whatever reason his name is always in the middle there also was lawyers for civil rights which is a non-profit immigrant advocacy group that filed the lawsuit on behalf of soros's Alianza Americas according to a press release Tuesday that described the latter group as a network of migrant-led organizations that are supporting immigrants across the United States and what they really mean is they they are supporting illegal immigration throughout the United States because that is what is happening of course we have a process in which if you are a person that is struggling and you live in another country and you want to seek Asylum we can welcome you but for whatever reason they want to get as many illegal immigrants over the Border as soon as possible and every time you talk about these migrant groups his name keeps coming up also though the MacArthur Foundation awarded 1.26 million dollars to Alianza Americas between 2008 and 2020 so if you want to look into the funding that's another great place to start if you're wondering what the MacArthur Foundation is they fund liberal Endeavors and they said back in 2020 that they were awarding 25 million dollars in Grants to address anti-black racism and support Native Americans impacted by covet 19. yeah they always tend to use black and brown issues and causes to fund Almighty to criminality right so they say oh well we are helping black and brown people and so therefore you can't say anything bad about what we're doing or else you're a racist right there we're tackling anti-racism we're supporting immigrants that is always the Mirage and of course when that Mirage dissipates you realize that what they are doing is harming Americans whether they are black brown white doesn't matter what color they are we are all being harmed by mass migration into Mass illegal migration into our country uh I want to also let you know that they are alleging via their lawsuit that is filed verbatim that desantas and others designed and executed a premeditated fraudulent and illegal scheme illegal I guess for everyone except for President Biden censored on exploiting this vulnerability for the sole purpose of advancing their own personal financial and political interests which is exactly what they are doing that is what the left does they accuse you of exactly what it is that they are doing they are exploiting the issue at the border because they want to get as many of these people in I've already told you the reason why I've been saying it for years before I even got here before the left even assumed power before Joe Biden who went into office I have been screaming I feel to Black America saying that they are trying to replace the Black American voting group they want to get them over the border and then they're going to say that we need to give all of them citizenship so that all of them have the right to vote and then they're going to offer them welfare which is a exactly what happened to Black America this offer of welfare dating back to the 1960s that I always tell you guys about it was an effort to get to marry black America to the government and it worked it worked for the last six seven decades black Americans have been voting for Democrats and voting for the left because so much other households are controlled to many of our households I should say our controls by welfare benefits so this is the scheme that the left is after and we will keep following that story because it's getting interesting now and I don't take DeSantis as somebody who is going to back down or be fearful of a lawsuit another story was in The Daily Mail and they were really just uncovering the the article title as the shocking numbers that show the unprecedented impact of illegal immigration into America that should make every politician wake up to this crisis and the thing is is I always think the angles of these articles of course they want to tell you this is what's actually happening at the border and I'm going to tell you what these numbers are but I think what they failed to recognize in these various analyzes is that this is by Design the politicians are aware of what's happening at the border they're not pretending this issue is that they just don't know they don't have the facts behind it they're doing this because they are trying to get these people in right if you don't think Gavin Newsom knows exactly what's happening at the border then you haven't been paying attention if you don't think Nancy Pelosi knows what's happening after the Border then you haven't been paying attention this is as I said a scheme against the American people and we have these people in office that are furthering this scheme but anyways back to this article all just so that you are aware in case you're not this week the U.S Customs and Border Protection Agency at long last release of Statistics from August showing that the numbers are that more than 2.15 million encounters with immigrants have taken place on the southern border between October of 2021 and August of 2022. full reporting period which runs through September will probably end up with 2.35 million encounters 2.35 Million by definition an encounter happens each time a border patrol agent physically lays hands on an individual that is attempting to enter the country illegally so no so so one migrant may be countered multiple times just to make that point clear but these numbers are completely off the charts 2.15 million encounters is the highest number since the Eisenhower Administration started keeping records in 1960 and it's also up from the 1.7 million encounters during Biden's first term and I thought that that number was crazy and that also was a record but they are somehow heading toward doubling it and to give you some comparison between 2010 and 2016 border patrol handled less than 500 000 encounters and they never got above 400 000 Encounters in 2011 2012 and in 2015 all together the border patrols 17 000 agents have had to process immigrants approximately four million times since Biden became president so once again we have what began as a conspiracy theory that obviously eventually just turned out to be true right we kept saying that the left wants illegal immigration the left is doing this intentionally and the second that they assume power Biden just allows this to run rampantly his administration rather allows it to run rampantly because we know Biden's not in control Biden is just a public president he's standing up there saying what he has to say he's trying to sell to the American people that there's nothing that's going on at the border that you're not actually being invaded at your own border it doesn't matter if you have anything to say about it shut up because you are clearly a racist and you are just against the other people coming over from other countries because you're a white racist Republican not that you're just a concerned American realizing that this is a very serious issue and we need to do something about it I want to jump in to this next I should almost say it's a non-story because we knew this a once again conspiracy theory turns out to be true turns out guys the Biden Administration colluded with big Tech to censor covet misinformation raise your hand if you are shocked my hand is not up because it was very clear that they were doing this at a time when people were not even allowed to during covet if you went in and you got the coveted vaccine right so that means you are clearly not anti-vaxx but if you had a reaction to it and you went on to Facebook and you wrote just got the shot and am now having heart palpitations or just got the shot and I have not been feeling good since I got it you would have had your account Frozen you would have maybe gotten a sticker that said coveted misinformation there were so many people that were having their posts completely taken down even though they were true it didn't matter because they decided that the authority that could speak about the safety and the effectiveness of the vaccines was of course the CDC and if they didn't say it it wasn't true and even if it was true and they didn't want to say it until or seven months later you weren't allowed to say it so obviously notoriously on my show and and let me tell you it was very difficult for me to report on this because the daily wire was concerned as they should have been that all of daily wire's Pages would have been taken down and their YouTube Pages would have been taken down this was happening to people for telling the truth but I reported on the fact that so many women that I had known were taking the vaccine and then were having very serious menstruation changes eventually a lot of these women went on to have miscarriages but the menstruation changes were unbelievable I mean I had one friend who was not going into a cycle for months just didn't have a cycle for three months wasn't pregnant I had another person who couldn't stop bleeding right A friend of mine that wouldn't stop bleeding and I started talking about this right I I is it anecdotal yes but it was too many women that were having these changes and what do the mainstream media do at first they Gaslight those women and they said oh you know it can just happen it could that could be for any reason that's going on and these women don't know what they're talking about and there has been no proof that this is related to the vaccine and then we waited about seven months and suddenly oh we did you know what that's true actually we realized that that is happening and now we're going to give millions and millions of dollars to research why it's happening that's what they actually did they Gaslight women first and then afterwards they said oh yeah it is happening we just didn't have the time to look into it because we were just focused on getting the vaccines out we were focused on lying to you and then telling you the truth later because we didn't want to dissuade other women from getting the vaccine which by the way it should have dissuade other women from getting the vaccine right obviously your cycle is really into pregnancy if you are a young woman and you know they have not tested to see why it's impacted menstruation and that means they are not testing to see how it could be impacting fertility right they didn't care how they lied to you because they needed to make the sale that was already made behind closed doors we know what really happened here we know what how this story really went no matter what they had agreed that they were going to release these vaccines and this was big Pharma colluding with our government agencies and we the people just had to shut up and take it so no it is not surprising to learn that in fact the federal government included also with big Tech over the past year to censor conversations even about covid that they thought contained false or my favorite misleading information out of context it's just there's some context that's missing according to newly released emails obtained via a lawsuit filed against top-ranking Biden Administration officials by Missouri and Louisiana's attorney generals Eric Schmidt and Jeff Landry for colluding with social media companies to censor Free Speech the communication records Show members of federal agencies such as the CDC coordinated with social media platforms on how to handle misinformation regarding the covid-19 pandemic so the info you're not informed about what's happening to your own body anymore only the government knows what's happening to your own body only the government knows why your child your Healthy young boy who got this vaccine suddenly has myocarditis only the government knows why so many young people were having blood clots throughout their body only the government knows you couldn't possibly draw the conclusion that a perfectly healthy person shouldn't just be dropping dead because they had a blood clot in an artery that just is not something that you could possibly reasonably collude I mean food by yourself so that's where we are in an email dated July 16 2021 that was addressed to the United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy a senior representative for Facebook discussed how the company and the buying Administration officials met to better understand the scope of what the White House expects from Facebook on misinformation going forward so yeah there it is free speech Free Speech as determined by government officials it's a sad realization but then it goes back to but I've been discussing with you guys which is I I don't know that we live in a free country and it makes me sad to say that it's it's something that I have believed my entire life that this was the freest country in the world and now I wonder if we have just become a nation that is so ignorant that we've accepted that belief without actually looking around and seeing whether or not it was true right is it is are we actually free if we don't have autonomy over our own bodies are we actually free if we can't make decisions for our children not under duress not because of fear not because of a peer pressure campaign but because we believe them to be the right decisions and my answer to that is no no I do not think that we are a free Nation if we are not able to make decisions in our own household without feeling that unless we do something we're going to have our jobs taken away from us that we are going to have our livelihoods stripped away from us and if that wasn't bad enough The Daily Mail is reporting that the new York City Department of Education has axed 850 teachers and classroom aides on top of the 1300 employees who took one year's unpaid leave it means that almost 2 000 School Employees will have been fired for failing to comply failing to comply with the vaccine mandate that was imposed last October of the 1300 who went on leave for a year 450 agreed to show proof of vaccination by September 5th the 450 who received a shot consisting of 225 teachers and 135 paraprofessionals are now returning to their prior schools or work locations the Department of Education official officials told the New York Post so just to give you the numbers here that means that about 1950 staffers have now been terminated from the department since the vaccine mandate was introduced on October 29 2021 why I think my question would be why why are we still doing this we know that whether or not you get one vaccine or four vaccines you are still able to both catch and spread covid we also know that the children are basically it's almost 100 percent of children who get covid are absolutely fine right even by the way if you're not a child right the survival rate of covid is almost 100 percent right we have a virtual 99 covered survival rate and yet you are forcing people to choose between their livelihoods and getting the shot which we know has a range of issues right we know for a fact that they have on the warning label that it could cause myocarditis but you're going to force these teachers to get it why what could possibly be the reason behind it why would you risk the education of children why would you have so many teachers leave and say actually I'm not going to abide by that they shouldn't by the way it's completely arbitrary what are you hoping is going to happen you know I remember from another episode that we had done last year that a person that was within the military was saying it was it became a way for them to almost figure out who would abide by what the government wanted no matter what right so it became a way for them to cleanse the military it became it's becoming a way for them to cleanse the Department of Education right they're saying okay well we know that if you will commit to getting the shot despite how arbitrary it is now it's abundantly arbitrary but if you'll do it anyways that means that we can commit you that you are committed to leftist ideology that means that perhaps this is what the guy was surmising that if we then tell you to teach these children about sexuality we then tell you to teach these small children if they can pick their gender and that would be a good thing for them to start puberty blockers we know that you will abide by it because you're doing this thing right this thing that makes no sense you're willing to roll up your sleeve and get four injections you're perfectly healthy and you know that these injections are not going to stop you from Catching or spreading it you know that we have continued to move the goal post in terms of what these injections actually do but if you're going to do it anyway and we've got you in a spot that we know that you are at least so fearful of us and so desperate to maintain your livelihood that you'll you'll do whatever we say whatever we say if we tell you not to tell a children's Mother that they are gender confused you will listen to it because now the state owns you I think that is likely by the way I think that when that person wrote that in I thought I could totally see that right they are making sure that everywhere they have people that are committed to helping the government grow power they don't want individualism they want us to Simply get in line and we shouldn't and that's all I have to say about that all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about how some states are quietly legalizing the composting of human remains so if you're not member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "RWzI38Oo66U": "I hate to cover her but I'd like to cover her uh today because she's so ridiculously crazy Julia Fox I don't know what on Earth possessed Kanye to date her for what was it two three weeks and now she's writing a book on their romance and now she's come out and she has said you know I only dated him to protect Kim Kardashian because she's like obsessed with the Kardashian family you can definitely tell and so she talks about them on Tick Tock like if those are my girls um she's also just as a side note you can just park this deeply unattractive inside and outside but she's now doing a video trying to explain to you that Hollywood's not weird and Balenciaga thing isn't weird and the problem is men take a listen you guys love saying the like Holly weird all the pedophiles and Holly weird listen up faces there's pedophiles in every industry you want to go be a chef you'll probably have some abusers over there you want to go be a teacher abusers over there you want to go be an engineer abusers over there this isn't an issue with Hollywood this isn't an issue with the Fashion World this isn't an issue with celebrities this is an issue with man God oh yeah that's totally stable she's a totally stable person you should just believe everything she says and so it's not an issue with Hollywood guys there's pedophiles everywhere if you want to be a chef as she says you should just expect I was literally better files there's pedophiles making your pasta when you go to the restaurant you should just expect that and the issue isn't the fact that there are sick twisted people in the world the issue is men it's always men which is strange to me because I'm pretty sure the fashion industry isn't exactly run by straight men and I'm pretty sure as we covered yesterday A lot of these photos their main stylist is actually a woman who's involved in some weird satanic stuff and her whole Instagram is littered with references to the devil and blood with babies it was a woman but you know the great thing about being a feminist which is something that Julia fox says that she is is that you never have to take responsibility for anything as that is the beauty of being a modern feminist no matter what happens no matter what you do no matter if you're staring at something straight in the face and it's so obvious that women have a hand in it all you have to do is say actually it's it's the fault of men so yeah it's no exaggeration to say that becoming a mother has been the greatest joy of my life being able to bring life into this world is a miracle that every mother and child deserves unfortunately our society has brainwashed us into believing that these precious lives are nothing more than clumps of cells that is why I am so excited to let you guys know that my show has partnered with pre-born pregnancy clinics pre-born is a pro-life Ministry that provides ultrasounds to women who are considering abortion when a mother sees their child and hears their heartbeat she will more often than not choose life the work that they are doing is so important and I want to share a client testimonial with you so you can hear it from one of the mother's own words take a listen to Olivia's story so Race's father is um he was my mentor we met working at the shop I was comfortable um being along with him I thought we were good friends I kind of took that as an opportunity to just get to know him on a deeper level I guess he wasn't interested in that he was more interested in the physical aspect of everything when I found out I was pregnant he was not okay with that either he pushed for an abortion and that's how I came to the clinic so I felt like the only ones that were really there for me were the women at the clinic and it actually did Empower me and help me I was late enough to get my ultrasound still remember you know feeling everything um is changing I said I would not get an abortion so I was going to raise this baby with or without him so he said without I think if I didn't find the clinic then I probably would have considered abortion the women there are just so kind they're just so genuine that would not be this strong without the clinic my dreams now revolve around my son I want to let people know that it's not over no matter what age you are you know you find out you're pregnant it's not over and that there's there are places to go and I want the individuals that are involved in the clinic to know how much we are all eternally grateful for everything that they do if I did abort my son I would live with many regrets now that I have them I don't think I can be in this world without him my son saved me I can honestly say that changed my life for the better isn't that amazing it's so powerful to hear these women's testimonies over the past 16 years pre-born has canceled over 450 000 women considering abortion and saved more than 188 000 babies pre-born introduces expectant mothers to their children via ultrasound and 80 of the time she is more likely to choose Life One ultrasound costs just 28 you can sponsor five ultrasounds for 144 dollars however if you are in a place to give more please do so through a match program going on right now your tax deductible gift is doubled whatever you donate you're saving twice as many children together we are on a mission to rescue 1500 babies before the end of this year and I know that we can do it so donate securely dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby that's pound 250 baby or go to preborn.com Candace that's preborn.com Candace if you consider yourself Pro life Now's the Time to act help us save 1500 babies at preborn.com Candace today okay so obviously I wish that we could just cover happy topics all day long I mean it just it beats me down that this is the depressive state of things today but it is so much more important to me that everybody is informed especially if you're like me and you're a mother to two young children I want to know everything that's going on in the school systems I want to know exactly what to look out for I want to be able to make a decision about where I should live it's the reason I picked up moved my family away from a liberal City because this stuff is real and unfortunately we don't talk about it they certainly aren't going to when I say they I'm talking about uh the Department of Education your teachers print the principles the teachers are not going to tell you what's going on because the entire point of all of this is to disrupt the family unit we talk about California all the time because it is an actual communist country that happens to be in the United States but in its own communist country and I have said to my listeners over and over again move if you live in California move I do not believe that they run a fair election process I believe that Gavin Newsom is a dark character and he is hell-bent on destroying the people of California it's just not worth I I don't believe it's worth the fight there anymore if you have young children and to add weight to that claim thousands of convicted pedophiles in California are now being released from prison less than a year after committing horrific acts terrific Acts including rape sodomy and sexual abuse of kids under 14. so this is actually going on The Daily Mail has been reporting on this and it's more than seven thousand sex offenders who are convicted of lewd acts with the child under 14 of yay of age but were let out of prison the same Europe they were incarcerated data from California Megan's laws Megan's Law database says so I don't know why they're doing this we've obviously been talking a lot about this that we're seeing people that are put into places of power that are making sure the laws are really lenient against pedophiles not just pedophiles also murderers people that commit crime it seems that they are trying to fill the streets with criminals and I am not sure why I cannot understand why other than to want to see chaos and to want terrible things to happen but we are seeing the crime rates keep trucking up in these inner city communities but especially in California the article goes on to say that others who committed some of the worst child sex crimes on the statute books served similarly short sentences including 365 pedophiles convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child who spent less than 12 months in prison 39 cases of sodomy with a child under 16 and three cases of kidnapping a child under 14 with intent to commit lewd acts according to the data former Los Angeles sex crimes prosecutor Samuel George Dooley and Toba daily ma The Daily Mail that he was shocked by the statistics and he described them as frightening for society and I think that frightening is the perfect adjective to describe exactly what's going on it's frightening to think that for whatever reason these people are being thrown onto the streets and I just do not understand and honestly comment you guys know I read your comments what would keep somebody tethered if you have a family you have a young family what would keep you Tethered to the inner city communities I understand there's work opportunities but I can't imagine choosing work over the safety of my children especially when there seems to be a government-sponsored incentive to put the Children at Risk whether it's in the classroom whether it's on the streets this is happening the statistics clearly show that pedophiles don't get reformed by the way they're going to come out and they're going to commit again obviously because you have to be far gone I mean so mentally deluded to commit a sex act against a small child a minor child and the fact that we people are being let out and you have all the statistics that are showing that they are likely to commit those same crimes again should have every single person concerned so I just wanted to bring that to your attention because I also talk about just aside from the criminals the criminality in Los Angeles uh the crime of even if when you're a parent you have no say over your children's health they have also the state has really squeezed in on that your children cannot go to school even if you homeschool now they get to tell you whether or not you have to back your child how many vaccines to give them if we're in the state of California so I just do not perceive it as a free state whatsoever and uh unless there is something unbelievable tethering you there it's time to pick up and move uh like I did with my family not away from California but away from inner city communities all right you guys the next portion of the show is going to available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "6h4molFrRm8": "all right I have a question for you guys who is your queen who is your king I want to know with the recent passing of Queen Elizabeth this question has been on my mind plus later on rapper pnb Rock was fatally shot at Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles what does that mean regarding the state of Black America all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] so I asked the question who is your queen I'm thinking about that because I've obviously like many of you been watching Queen Elizabeth's State funeral but also watching the mixed reaction to it I have to say I am pretty amazed I'm sure you two are following the backlash from the more woke crowd because everything is an opportunity to tell black people that they should be upset right they referred to Queen Elizabeth as a colonist a murderer okay I'm not really interested in defending those positions I easily could but I'm more interested in covering the stark contrast regarding the individuals who attacked her and their positions on previous things that have occurred within Black America ready so the first person obviously I'd like to talk about which you probably heard about because the timing of her tweet was just incredible it felt like moments after we learned that Queen Elizabeth had passed she felt it was necessary to send a vicious disgusting tweet this is a professor of course it's always a professor at Carnegie Mellon her name is uju Anya and she tweeted this I heard the chief monarch of A thieving raping genocidal Empire is finally dying May her pain be excruciating I want to focus on that word raping right because apparently you have to assume that rape bothers her but you shouldn't assume that because do you remember Jacob Blake do you remember the black man uh who police officers were attempting to apprehend his charges were as follows he essentially to give you the back story in case you don't remember it uh it was a woman that he was involved with a black woman who had called the police to the scene over a domestic dispute she had previously accused him of sexual assault and he was not supposed to be near her but he was back and confronting her and she called police to assist her obviously because he had a warrant out for his arrest for that previous sexual assault police said that he had a knife when they arrived and police told him to drop the knife he did not drop the knife and a knife was eventually recovered from that scene by the way I want to be more explicit here he was accused of digitally raping that woman who called police to the scene she would think that ujuanya would have something to say about that and she did have something to say what she said was Jacob Blake is a family man she went on to say his sister latitra Woodman reminds us all that he has people and he is somebody's people no image you paint of him erases that no story you tell alleging his lack of worth justifies the crime police committed against him wow okay so she doesn't care that a woman called and obviously was scared for her life she doesn't care that a woman has accused him of sexual assault she doesn't care that a woman has accused him of digitally raping her because nothing that you could possibly say could denigrate Jacob Blake in her mind who cares if he was a knife-wielding maniac it doesn't matter because I don't know black Americans should see him as some sort of a brave hero I guess see him as a victim this happens over and over and over again I have to ask the question who are the people that we are told that we should feel badly for who are the people that we are told that we should celebrate who are our kings and queens not far behind of course was the Washington Post this is a tweet from columnist Karen attire regarding Queen Elizabeth's passing she wrote black and brown people around the world who were subject to horrendous cruelties and economic deprivation under British colonialism are allowed to have feelings about Queen Elizabeth after all they were her subjects too okay so the idea here is obvious black Americans have been subjected to horrendous cruelties under British colonialism got it Karen now what were her thoughts on George Floyd if you want to talk about Black Americans that suffer under the hands of somebody George Floyd would be an interesting uh topic to discuss the George Floyd death she tweeted this I will never forget that George Floyd called out for his late mother in the moments before he died and the whole world responded we got you big Floyd well first off fact check I should mention that regarding calling out for his mama his girlfriend who was white testified on the stand that she was mama that he called her mama affectionately and he had done so in previous arrests which you will see in my George Floyd documentary which is going to be dropping soon but Karen took it a step further Karen also tweeted George Floyd better get times person of the year Okay so just so I'm clear here Queen Elizabeth is a horrendously cruel person under which black people have suffered around the world but George Floyd better get times person of the year George Floyd how many arrests did he have was I think nine in total for various crimes a lot of drug charges obviously drugs have been a huge problem in Black America criminality remember when he knocked on a woman's door pretended to be from the water department he had a towering figure I think he was six seven six foot seven forced his way into her apartment put a gun to her abdomen and robbed the place yeah he better get timed person of the year this is constantly the message that is coming down the pipeline for Black America we need to celebrate criminals but when we talk about somebody with a life and a legacy of Queen Elizabeth well she's white so we better see ourselves and perceive ourselves as the victims nobody cares about how black American culture has been suffering nobody cares about the inner city communities that have been suffering under people like George Floyd right the criminality that is running rampant people that are getting arrested and released back onto the streets nobody cares nobody wants to talk about it in fact if you do talk about it you're a racist right that's it you're a racist if you talk about it and you're a black person okay they won't call you racist instead they will call you as they have called me a [\u00a0__\u00a0] and Uncle Tom a traitor to my race because I have the audacity to talk about the things that are harming us inadvertently sexual Community right we have been told that our value is somehow tied to our sexuality yeah let's make fun of people like Candace Jones who are talking about how songs like WAP are harming young black girls as they are coming up right harming it's it is harmful to hear music like that thoughts become things it's harmful to put that stuff onto TV and to have women glorifying that to have young girls going to this concert and saying this is a good thing so who is our Queen in Black America who is our King is our King George Floyd is that it because I don't remember any of these professors and journalists commenting on the fact that he got three funerals and was buried in a gold casket that was our state funeral so to speak but everyone was okay with that nobody cared about the horrific things that he did throughout his life because it wasn't politically expedient didn't create the narrative enough for them of white people bad black people always good nobody cares to comment on the state of things in Black America we worship who Beyonce is the queen right Beyonce Queen Beyonce Queen slay Bay and what's coming down to young women from her this is an example by the way as of Beyonce in a campaign Ivy Park Adidas Ivy Park is her brand Adidas has acquired it they're in some partnership I want you to actually take a look at this clip of her squatting down right opening her legs a jar and putting a finger into her mouth as she wears tight spandex here's my question why when someone bounces and opens their crotch does that make you want to buy the product more it's a serious question I'm sure Black America will watch this clip and say oh my God Candace you're so prude oh my God who cares she slayed the day that's Beyonce she's Bae she's Queen she's slated why is Beyonce not talented enough and beautiful enough to get us to buy her gym kit without having to be seductive without having to be overtly sexual I actually think that it's it denigrates her Talent she's a beautiful voice she's had a long career and yet this is the way that we have to sell stuff in Black America apparently this is what we view to be Queen this is the sorts of people that we think should have multiple funerals should they die right this is a problem think about even the Partnerships which I find to be strange when we have rappers that take on Partnerships with fast food companies for example Megan the stallion she has hot sauce at Popeyes we have ubereats which has offered Migos to have a themed Popeyes meal we have sweetie and Travis Scott who have Partnerships with McDonald's so fast food right when they think of going into Partnerships with black America it's fast food okay you can have chicken you can have Popeyes you can have hot sauce this is what you black people like right it's insulting I find all of it to be insulting and of course what people want you to do is to focus on anything but real black history right they don't want to talk to you about the state and governance the over governance that's happening in Black America when I get on a stage and I talk about the welfare system where I talk about how for Democrats Black America has provided a lab rat experiment experiment right they went back into the 1960s and they saw a black American culture that was together that is what happened in the 1960s black Americans were married black Americans had their families together black Americans believe it or not this is a fact in the 1950s under Jim Crow black Americans were out pacing white Americans in terms of economic growth because we had better values because we had a better culture and then they saw this Lyndon Baines Johnson who is an overtly racist president who sat in the White House said we have to fix that and how they fixed it was via the Great Society act they offered black Americans welfare benefits they said we're here to help we're the government we're here to help you but here's what you're gonna have to do to get those welfare benefits we'll give you more money if you don't marry the father of your children they sent people from the government around to inspect homes to make sure that black men were not living in them to make sure that they furthered the single motherhood rate and every other ill has followed obviously father absence is the main thing that is harming Black America it is something to be noted that in the 1960s a single motherhood rate was just 23 in Black America and during those times that was considered a crisis 23 percent of black children growing up without a father in the home today the single motherhood rate is something like 74 in Black America and so you ask the question why so many black men are locked up without asking the question is how many of them grew up with fathers in the home these things have a lot to do with one another but nobody wants to talk about that no no it doesn't matter it's just racism is the reason that they're in prison it's not because of a rotten culture it's not because of WAP it's not because of nudity it's not because of overt sexuality it's not because we are only seen as a community that can further things like fast food that's the partnership that's great you're a rapper hey I'm going to want a chicken sandwich none of that is racist none of that is harmful um no absolutely not the issue is Queen Elizabeth it's Queen Elizabeth and historical racism and that's what we should be upset about the issue is not the fact that we're getting arrested but the ways in which the police are dealing with us let's talk about police brutality instead of talking about why it is that we are having so many correspondences with police why it is that black Americans black American men specifically young black American men are over represented when it comes to murders in this country talking about something like six percent of the population that commits about 40 percent of all of the murders don't talk about that Candace we don't like the facts we do not like that it is harmful for you to Aspire to something better Candice to Believe In Black America is what's wrong with you so we're going to call you a race Trader

into some topics du jour foreign [Music] s reparations you know the left has been beating this drum for some time obviously if you have a thinking brain you know that what they're really asking for is another reason for the government to tax people into Oblivion and maybe at the end of it they're going to take tons of taxes they're probably going to set up some borrow to deal with the taxes maybe some more IRS agents I don't know and then maybe each black American will get a hundred dollars if you can prove that you were somehow a slave in this country I actually support reparations I think that if you were ever a slave in this country you should get operations and if you were ever a slave owner in this country then you should paste some operations that's my personal opinion unfortunately that excludes everybody because there is nobody who has been a slave that is living and there is nobody who has had slaves uh that is living right now in America I'm talking about obviously black slaves not human sex trafficking and those things which our government doesn't seem to want to deal with or discuss at all so this was a wonderful moment that happened over at CNN live and what I really love about this moment is how quickly Don Lemon wants to get out of this segment as he starts to inquire with a royal expert about you know Britain paying some reparations you know and you guys have this horrible Empire what do you what do you think about that let's watch the clip well this is coming when you know there's all of this wealth and you hear about it comes as England is facing Rising costs of living a living crisis austerity budget cuts and so on and then you have those who are asking for reparations for colonialism and they're wondering you know 100 billion dollars 24 billion dollars here and there 500 million there some people want to be paid back and and members of the public are wondering why are we suffering when you are you know you have all of this vast wealth those are legitimate concerns for sure well I think you're right about reparations in terms of if people want it though what they need to do is you always need to go back to the beginning of a supply chain where was the beginning of the supply chain that was in Africa and when that crossed the entire world when slavery was taking place which was the first nation in the world that abolished uh slavery the first nation in the world to abolish it it was started by William Wilberforce was the British in in Great Britain they abolished slavery 2 000 Naval men died on the high seas trying to stop slavery why because the African kings were rounding up their own people they had them on cages waiting in the beaches no one was running into Africa to get them and I think you're totally right if reparations need to be paid we need to go right back to the beginning of that supply chain and say who was rounding up their own people and having them hancocking Pages absolutely that's where they should start and maybe I don't know the descendants of those families where they died at the in the high seas trying to stop the slavery that those families should receive something too I think at the same time love this girl it's an interesting discussion Hillary thank you very much I appreciate it we'll continue to discuss in the future woman you see even reparations that's the best way to handle it now let's get into some historical facts and people don't like that you want to get out of the segment really quickly because you're not supposed to talk about that right there's in some reimagined history apparently white people went to Africa and stole sleeves and then they brought them over to America and that's just a glorious retelling obviously it was African kings that sold their own people this was going on all over the world it did not slavery did not begin in America slavery did not begin in Great Britain it is black Africans that fought to keep the slave trade and by the way and it's an embarrassing fact they sold their people for things as non-consequential as Jin mirrors I talk about this in my book I've talked about this on tour but most black Americans don't know this because we have Gatekeepers like Don Lemon who don't want us to have the facts they just want us to have the emotions right oh shouldn't we be getting some reparations from from Great Britain even though uh that was actually they were the first to abolish the slave trade followed by France another white Nation followed by America another predominantly white Nation Oh inconvenient fact we're going to have to completely get out of that segment and this is why I say that the greatest Injustice that has been done to Black America and Black Americans is being done within the school system right the average black American doesn't does not know his or her own history that is just the truth when you talk to them they believe in this weird retelling that's taken place which allows then for the government to harness their emotions when certain things take place the average American forget not knowing their history they don't know their present right the average black American if you walked up to them and you said how many black Americans are being shot and killed by police officers in a year well they would have all of these media depictions like those uh presented by Don Lemon and they would maybe guess a thousand that's usually when I asked the question they say I don't know a thousand thousands of them absolutely not it's about eight eight per year and if you factor in people that were armed like Jacob Blake or people that were resisting arrest and presented some sort of a threat to the police officer you'd be down to maybe one or two that's the truth but the truth has no business on CNN of course which is why they had to quickly get out of the segment and thank her for her time all right guys the next thing that I want to cover and this is just sad to me on a lot of different levels so there is a rapper uh his name was pnb rock is pnb Rock but he was fatally shot at Rock Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles and so uh The Story Goes that he was with a female friend my understanding is that she was also the mother of his child and a photo of them eating was posted onto social media she posted that photo and she tagged their location shortly after he was fatally attacked and shot and robbed and this is a sad story of course because we're just talking about criminality but the reaction to this within Black America was very disturbing to me um now of course he had an extensive amount of valuables on him he had jewelry uh chains around his neck and that is obviously what motivated this crime but the reaction amongst a lot of people that have a platform within Black America other rappers uh was to attack the girl for having posted their location right there were conspiracy theories that were being started people were saying oh it's her fault it's it's absolutely her fault she wanted she set him up like why on Earth would she set him up I don't know but this was the reaction attacked the woman for posting his location not to offer any commentary about the state of things that a person cannot within black American rap culture that they cannot post where they are and have a meal that they cannot sit down in a restaurant eat chicken and post something on social media saying this is where I am and this is what routinely happens it's it's it's almost like a guard against corruption we you never have a serious conversation about how you can prevent these things going forward because our culture and by the way I should mention they still have not found uh the individual there's very little information on the suspect at this point and that's because there is this protocol within Black America of no snitching you've heard this a thousand times right this is Gang culture no snitching so somebody did this to him somebody knows who did this to him but they will be threatened they will their own lives will be at risk if they come forward and they say anything and rather than talking about how we got here how we got into this culture where individuals have to think like this when they walk outside of their households the instinct is to attack the female for posting something as harmless as hey here's where we are here's what we're eating which is something that people do all the times but the the lesson I guess or what people are stressing to her is that she should have known better she should have known that this could potentially happen that you cannot as an individual that is within rap culture as a woman that is dating someone that is in rap culture think that you're just allowed to post your meal and I wanted to then further that discussion by discussing this document that I'm holding which is just a list of rappers uh that have been shot there's about 16 rappers that have been shot and killed in 2022 alone and we're not really allowed to discuss it I mean I can I'm just reading off of this list we have and by the way I'm going to get mocked for not knowing how to say these names so people are not going to care about having this very serious discussion about why so many of our young black men are being killed they are going to focus on how I wasn't able to pronunciate uh the rapper names we have young Dolph he was shot and killed slim 400 drachio the ruler uh J stash which was a murder-suicide event Drake real the ruler by the way was stabbed to death you have Earl swavey who was shot and killed 4-1-4 Little Mo who was shot and killed snooty Wilde shot and killed gunu shot and killed Archie eversole shot and killed by his brother hypo stabbed to death trouble shot and killed FBG cash shot and killed by rival gang members you have money gang vonte who was shot and killed in a pharmacy in a pharmacy you have rolly bands who was shot and killed you have Jay deyoungin who was shot and killed you have young sloby who was shot and killed I mean the list goes on and on and on and on and on and of course rather than anybody offering commentary on why worrying for your life has to be a real thought if you have a talent and you want to rap we're not we're not allowed to open that discussion without being accused I suppose to being a race Trader this is just what rap culture is but yeah let's focus on policing instead let's come out in hordes when someone like George Floyd dies and protests how they're just killing us right all eight people that are killed by police officers per year they're just killing us but these almost 16 rappers that have died just the rappers alone right that have died in 2022 is something that we just go well that's just that's our culture and we have to I guess fight to protect it in some weird regard like I said yesterday I don't know when this became Black Culture I get that commentary all the time Candace you don't know but coach you don't represent Black Culture I do not want to represent this Black Culture stop stop pitching it to me stop trying to accuse me of wanting to be a part of it I want nothing to do with it I offer commentary because it needs to change right we need to reflect and have a serious discussion if we want things to change we need to stop blaming white people for these things right we need to sit down and look in the mirror and say how did we get here we talk about the music that is on the airwaves because as I said earlier thoughts become things and when you are celebrating gun culture and when you are celebrating drugs you're making it a cool thing for children that are growing up without a father in the home right that's what happened happens you break down the black family as the government has strategically done dating back to the Great Society act what happens is these children will still pursue paternity elsewhere and that elsewhere is the streets the elsewhere is when they put on their headphones and they listen to rap music they're looking for somebody to raise them and these are the people that are raising them they eventually become these individuals this is sad this is honestly a sad predicament and it makes me sad that I am one of the only people that I know that has the courage to comment on that as a next topic which is of course a moment brought To Us by the view um if you want to talk about people that are constantly race-baiting and getting people to focus on things that just don't even matter we have to talk about the ladies on The View and sunny Hosten who was hired the reason she's keeping her job is that the entire reason she was hired is to race bait is to everywhere say Oh Black America this is a threat Black America this is why this is happening there's racism everywhere don't worry about rappers don't worry about people being murdered in the streets don't worry about black on black crime it's always something that's happening in terms of white people that are harming black people focus on that tunnel vision tunnel vision television well something hosting is now being branded a racist because she attacked Nikki Haley accusing her of not using her Indian name to appeal to white people the idea Republican voters that's why she's using the name Nikki take a listen to this clip Nikki Haley's gone by Nikki since is a child that's documented in high school I wouldn't be shocked that as somebody an Indian woman growing up in South Carolina at that time she actually did to avoid Prejudice so I just want to be careful about critiquing here there are some of us that can be chameleons and decide not to embrace our ethnicity so that we can pass Americans can't pronounce awesome because of the um but sometimes I would say what a list is saying is that people gravitate to names for different reasons it's just stunning she is accusing Nikki Haley of not using her real name while at the same time knowing that she doesn't use her real name then she just defends herself she's like oh well people don't know how to pronounce my name so it's fine for me to use a nickname but for some reason when Republican does it it's because she's trying to what pass as white is the implication of this discussion oh by the way fun fact uh Nikki Haley hit back on Twitter and she told her told Sonny that it was quote racist of you to judge my name she also added that Nikki is quote an Indian name and is on my birth certificate and I'm proud of that yeah it turns out that Nikki is actually her middle name so she is using her real government given name that she has had since she was born right and sunny has created a name that is not on her birth certificate but somehow Sonny gets to offer commentary because oh I don't know Republicans uh the theme of the view is that Republicans are horrible and backwards and and racist somehow and they're even racist when they use their middle names yeah that is the messaging that is coming down the pipeline the pipeline and it's it's constant as you guys know I'm constantly talking about this I'm trying to get black Americans to wake up to this truth to realize that we are being emotional emotionally manipulated all the time Always by the mainstream media trying to get us to see ghosts and to see Boogeyman where they don't exist and to ignore the blatant elephants that are in the room and as I mentioned earlier uh that elephant in the room is that we have become a culture that has degenerated over time we are no longer putting good music on the airwaves we are no longer putting good TV on the airwaves what started as family matters which is a show that I grew up with and absolutely loved with Steve Urkel and Stefan and these discussions about family mattering has turned into Love and Hip-Hop has turned into promoting baby mama culture in promoting thuggery has turned into [\u00a0__\u00a0] I grew up listening to my grandpa's music listening to The Temptations and now what is being offered and what is being glorified are people like cardi B you know we went from a culture of people speaking of The Temptations of individuals that wore suits you know and by the way this is not just Black America obviously I've offered commentary on episodes past about women in general regardless of your color putting out your bodies on display this pornographic culture that we live in right and Black America is always being encouraged and applauded to continue to do that to continue to harm ourselves what it means when they want us to be the face of various fast food companies when they are telling us that we should applaud lizzo's obesity and that if we say No actually that's the number one killer in America obesity is the number one killer why are we promoting fast food why are we having all these rappers going to Partnerships with fast food companies why can't they promote something healthy why can't we have them go into a partnership with an organic product it is it is death and destruction within the black community and we have somehow gotten into lockstep in partnering with that messaging uh and things are not going to change until more people speak out all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on whether or not I think monogamy is natural so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] [Music]", "LS98z7rmQrg": "this is a controversial opinion I think I I have already shared with you guys I think I may have done this behind the paywall that when it comes to workplace relationships I am not against them I know a lot of people are and I can totally understand why they are especially in the post metoo era especially if you're a male executive you could just think to your employees nobody date anybody we just don't want any drama but in my opinion especially as someone that's in their 30s and I see my friends that are unmarried and in their mid-20s and 30s where else do you really meet people if you're not the person who wants to go out on a Friday night and get drunk and go to the bar in the club like you did in your early 20s you spend the majority of your time at work and so it's natural in my opinion for workplace romances to Bud and I think it's a good thing I would be I would be totally okay if people that I worked with you know got into a relationship a consensual relationship and dated and maybe even potentially got married as long as they don't bring any drama in their relationship into the workplace right and my perspective is that drama happens at work no matter what so if it's drama because they are exes or if it's drama because they just don't like each other toxicity in the workplace should be dealt with accordingly so if you're divorced now and you hate each other and you're biting at work you're both going to be fired right if you don't like each other because you're once best friends and now you're fighting over someone outside of work you're both going to be fired so I don't really see an issue with workplace relationships as long as the hierarchy is appropriate meaning that I don't think it would be wise for an executive Dayton intern I think that causes a lot of other issues and and talk and that has to do with more of power structures and it could be inappropriate saying all this because obviously what's been in the Press is that TJ Holmes and Amy roback of Good Morning America had a relationship and it looks like by the way that both of them who were married and are now getting divorced were were not being they were being Infidel in their marriages and I have a problem with that personally the idea that they imploded their own marriages to be together it's wrong and you guys know how I feel about marriages and monogamy so I do not like that personally but professionally I do not see how it presents a problem and basically ABC from the executives they said that there was no violation in terms of their contracts they don't have anything in place that says explicitly that you can't you know date people inside the workplace but it has caused a firestorm in terms of people saying that it just violates the values of Disney so what we have in the news today is that a former Good Morning America executive has spoken spoken out and in case you don't know these two people they're on leave right now at work Amy roback and TJ Holmes and he has spoken out and saying he said quote the broken marriages and the cheating including the reports that TJ had another affair with the different GMA colleague is unseemly and embarrassing and a gross violation of core Disney values and so he believes that they are both potentially going to lose their jobs over this I laughed when I saw that like because this is Disney a gross violation of their values yeah probably because the two of them are heterosexual I'm just making sure this is the same Disney that wants to make everything gay at Disney World and trans your kids and make them confused about their gender let's stop pretending that Disney has values and suddenly two people that are heterosexual entering and consensual relationship is a gross violation and so I was saying when I saw the story my thought process was If Only They had both come out and said they were gay then they would have said we were just so proud of them if like if TJ Holmes came out as a gay man and his host is another man he said I'm leaving my marriage because I'm gay I realized and I'm in love with Martin next to me they would have been like we're so proud of them Sparkles sprinkles rainbows unicorns this is amazing he's just finding out who he is that's exactly what would happen because if you haven't realized it yet there is Extreme bias and bigotry toward heterosexual couples that's what's happening right now then and and because they're because they're heterosexual is problematic but if they were gay if only TJ and Amy roback had been gay and lesbian this would have been an entirely different Scandal I do not agree with them getting into any trouble to consenting adults yes I I form I really disagree with them on a personal level they're friends of mine and I I am so such a strong support in the institution of marriage and it offends me on a personal level but professionally I don't see how this is really the business of Good Morning America all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about a strange Twitter account called pup ravage where members of the army are posting photos of themselves in pup play Kink costumes so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "zNuJ1r6ugNo": "so much happened on 9 11 in terms of the commemoration and i was just so sickened by so much i couldn't even post a tribute because it just felt like our country has become a farce and i guess to start with this clip of bush you know and who can't just keep the focus on the people who actually executed 911 not you know focus on the terrorists or the jihadists instead he goes with talking about the american people so let's actually watch that clip of what he said during his speech we have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders but from violence that gathers within there is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home but then there's disdainful pluralism in their disregard for human life in their determination to defile national symbols they are children of the same foul spirit and it is our continuing duty to confront them yeah i don't know how this turned into like let's focus on the american people but also i want to point out that at the same time in the morning of 9 11 apple news sent out this amazing alert how the 911 attacks ushered in an era of fear and mistrust in the u.s and set the stage for the january 6th insurrection so all day you're feeling this sort of we're kind of trying to connect the dots here but we'll let you connect with dots we're not going to say it explicitly but we're going to let you connect the dots that you know this is the new form of terrorism well i i you know when he said that i i thought comparing blm to al qaeda it's a little harsh george they're this children of the same foul spirits and then but then it occurred to me bush was not talking about blm even though they killed people and burned down courthouses and burned down police departments and burned down cities and stole lots of property he was talking about these people on january 6th because he said they attack our national symbols and while a federal courthouse somewhere in the middle of the country might be a national symbol i think he was alluding to the capital and he was using these merely mathed words he wouldn't even come out and say it he just had this vague implication it was classless it was tasteless and it reminds us of a big problem from the bush administration which is he can't talk about the problem in specificity it's always got to be the vague violent extremism and and this was part of the misdefinition of the war in afghanistan or iraq or the war on terror broadly from the beginning we never knew what we were talking about and here to to have the former president express the same contempt that he does for al qaeda for the american people for hit for his own supporters on the 20th anniversary it was the most shameful act i've seen george bush come in no it's a thorough going shame and what's amazing about this is you know everything that you have been told about january 6th is a lie we know this now we were told over and over again that this was an event that killed a capital police officer it did not the coroner's report definitively showed that that was not the case biden cnn msnbc they all kept saying it we've been lied to and lied to and lied to again and again about this event up to the point of just casually calling it an insurrection casually assimilating all trump supporters half of the american people or perhaps more so to this you know to the idea of that you know that that would be the same thing as actual violent terrorism it's such a crying shame to see george bush the man who presided over this great tragedy in our nation's history try to buy into this mono party nonsense that you know this is all the same things i don't know that he bought into it if it was already there i think there's a lot more that's being unveiled to us it was a different time than you know as i mentioned before in my monologue it's different time than in america we just had our tv screens we all just believe whatever was told to us by the newscasters there was no social media there was no way for us to independently verify what we saw or take out our smartphones and and capture what was real what was not and when i see these people together right and i see bush walking with clinton you know walking with obama by the way look at this extraordinary picture does this look like american freedom like when you think about america does this picture say to you america the land of the free and the land of the brave it looks like a recent picture uh that was released of the afghan women in kabul at kabul university on the exact same day side by side i'm just saying you know candace people are going to attack you for that comparison that comparison is way less offensive than the one bush made on 911 right right 100 it's like literally what is what were we even fighting for i mean we've adopted more of their customs and they've adopted ours apparently you know and and so this whole concept of freedom i just you know it was this day to me was sad for different reasons this time because i just looked and i said this is not my country this is not the sentiment that i had after 9 11 this these people do not represent what it means to be an american well ironically it is an unmasking right because at this point as you say you put that picture up on screen you can see exactly what this is a one-party oligarchy they've been consolidating power over the american people and lording it over them exerting it to their detriment for nion 20 years now probably more and we can see them now there that you know biden came out when he announced his vaccine mandates which i'm sure we'll talk about you know he didn't have there was no concern for what people wanted he was telling us what was going to happen from the top down they are appalled they find it ludicrous that we should suggest that we have any right to have any say in how our lives go and the only sort of ounce of hope in this for me is that that's not the american people that doesn't represent me or you or anybody here in this room and it doesn't represent the majority of america and the people who are being disgraced and shamed overseas right now in afghanistan that's not the american people that's not the brave servicemen who lost their lives there either it's them it's the ruling class in the oligarchy that cares not a wit about what you or i think and there was to your point candace there was i mean there's always sadness especially i'm a new yorker you know we knew a lot of people and there's always a sadness on the anniversary of 9 11 but there was a special sadness i think now after this shameful chaos in afghanistan you look you say what what was accomplished through the fecklessness of our leaders i think there was a something else we're mourning which is that one of the defining events of the months after september 11th was this massive growth of the surveillance state this massive growth of the unaccountable bureaucracies new government agencies power taken away from the people's civil liberties taken away from the people given to to these headless godless unaccountable agencies that are now expressing their open contempt open disdain for the american people and you're seeing it in real time you're seeing it through attacks through the irs they're trying to get more of our bank information through the vaccine mandates through osha for goodness sakes what where in the constitution do i see that that particular right and and so you're looking at this and saying gosh the country didn't really get maybe we got a little better in the days following that attack when we all came together but since then the political system has just decayed before we move on let me say i love a good disrupter a company that comes in and shakes up the status quo for the betterment of you the consumer pure talk is that company if you're chained to overprice unlimited plans from verizon a t or t-mobile there is a better option pure talk pure talk saves the average family over 800 a year without having to sacrifice coverage because they're on the same exact network as one of those big guys you can keep your phone keep your number and get huge discounts on the latest iphones and androids with pure talk right now get unlimited talk text and six gigs of data for just 30 a month or if you still want unlimited data you can get it and you will still save a fortune grab your cell phone dial pound 250 and say canis owens and you'll save an additional 50 off your first month that's pound 250 and say candace owens pure talk is simply smarter wireless yeah exactly and there once was a man who said that we needed to make america great again and he was actually out on 9 11. different kind of optics going on there this photo of trump not wearing a mask surrounded by the people that actually sacrificed you know on 911 the people that were down there [Applause] american flag waving like this is a photo of what it means like this is what america is this photo just feels right you look at you and i smiled as soon as i saw it i was like yes that's it he doesn't seem like he's ruling over the people he seems like he understands the people and he's and he's on the ground with the people and this is what america misses you know what's so important about this photo and the the ruling class and the established classes never quite understood this about trump they say why do the people like trump he's a billionaire or why do republicans like trump he used to be a democrat or why do some democrats like trump now he's a republican and what they don't realize is those distinctions are not what is at issue right now it's not a class war it's not rich versus poor it's not a race war it's not a sex war it's not even a partisan war because as you say spencer there is just kind of this uniparty there's this one established blob trump is not in that club when the bushes and the obamas and biden get together they don't call up donald trump because he represents something else and you can see who he represents right there in that photo here's something else important in that picture and it's the smiles on the faces of every person there right because you compare that with the masks that are obscuring the faces of our of our sort of you know bloodless leaders here are here are the american people and the heroes of the american people standing together with this leader and smiling and people you know the the people that run this country don't think that it matters they don't think that it matters to show your face you only have to go through you know get on an airplane to see the demoralizing regime that they want they don't they don't see us as individuals you know what i mean that's the point is that when you look at somebody's face you know you you recognize them to be an individual you see the way that they're reacting you recognize their humanity they don't want us to see each other as human beings it makes it easier to kind of bring forth this regime of atrocity which is what it seems like biden wants to do oh that's not your neighbor that's not your friend that's not a person you know that's a person who's refusing to get the vaccine a bag of disease is exactly right and we do have a clip actually of trump i think just a 10 second clip or a short clip of him addressing the police and you can just feel the energy in the room two bravest people right next door and you know you love each other because i know the blue we love the blue i'll say it loud you know you're not supposed to say

happens in the middle of the day you just get very angry about it and frustrated at it and maybe your husband looks at you and goes are you are you good like my husband looks at me when I fly into a little mini rage about something I'm going to share mine with you plus Disney apparently has values now because they're claiming that the public extramarital affair of their hosts TJ Holmes and Amy roback of Good Morning America is a quote gross violation of their core values okay all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] so we all have weird pet peeves things that you see throughout the day and you're like oh that really frustrates me and annoys me and I want to talk about that today because I have an odd one before I get into mine I'm going to give you kind of the line of thinking that I'm talking about here uh you guys know Matt Walsh obviously he has a podcast you have daily wire it's great you should listen to it and his frustration I should say is with people that go to the grocery store and then just leave their cart they don't put them back the carts back where they belong he thinks the beginning and the end of civilization starts with people doing the right thing and returning their grocery store cards take a listen to what he has to say about that let's go to our daily cancellation um this is a very important subject and I believe I've addressed it before on the show I don't think I've I've taken the time to issue a cancellation related to it I don't think if I have then I'm repeating myself and just deal with it stop complaining okay this is my show don't judge me so I want to show you something this is a real photo I took it myself it's difficult to look at I warn you you have kids in the room I would say have them turn away for a moment not appropriate for them I don't even know if they're going to let me show this without blurring it out it is pretty graphic but okay here we go here's the picture as you can see there those are shopping carts in a Walmart parking lot left in the middle of the parking lot this is what I stumbled across yesterday there is a cart Corral not but 20 feet away look at the one closest to the grass that's five feet from the receptacle five feet this is someone who almost to make a point had pushed the cart nearly all the way there and then said no I can't go any further I I I can't I I can't I've gone too far My legs will give out it's too much um and then they just leave it there and this was a breezy day yesterday by the way those are not shopping carts those aren't Torpedoes all it takes is an errant wind to send one of those things crashing into someone's side panel it has been the primary goal of my life and my life's main ambition to combat these shopping cart ditchers to expose them to punish them to shame them I truly believe that the entire the entirety of a person's character can be assessed based on what they do with their shopping carts after they've unloaded their groceries hilarious it's also true why can't people make a little bit of effort at the grocery store and put their carts back exactly where they found them he is correct you can assess somebody's character by these little mundane things that they do throughout their day well here's my strange pet peeve and I don't think it's that strange at all actually but there is a restaurant here in the Nashville area and every single time I pass it I fly into a rage because of the name of the restaurant and this is something that often we can be traveling around the world based on what people name their restaurants I fly into a little mini monologue to myself my husband looks at me and he's like are you okay are you okay or there's a place here the Nashville area that is called Taco four like the number four life like tacos faux life like what is that what why is this called tacos for life I get super angry every time I see it every time we pass it to go to another store my husband says to me are you okay and I go no actually I'm not okay I just think they could have named this anything else why would they name it Taco for life it's so childish it's something that you expect to see on the back of a bathroom stall when you're in high school you know so and so was here maybe on a school bus if you're on it people right on the back of school bus seats you know uh Connecticut for life if you're from Connecticut there's something about it that is so childish that it drives me insane and I see more and more of it in American society where people are naming things that sound like hashtags that's something you might see on Tick Tock and I get frustrated about it and suddenly I started to realize that you can draw a line between Matt Walsh's frustration with the grocery carts and my frustration with the way people are naming their restaurants nowadays and that line occurred to me when I was finishing up a book I took some notes in this book that I was reading a couple of months ago called Catholicism a journey to the heart of the faith it's written by Robert Barron uh Bishop Barron and and he has a couple of quotes that I think are tremendous and I want to share them with you today one quote is if God is a great Gathering Force then sin is a scattering power when I say that again if God is a great Gathering Force then sin is a scattering power right and things that become scattered whether it is a grocery cart and you are just not putting it back where it belongs or in this case language we have scattered language so much and that is what drives me insane the English language is suffering a blow It suffers a blow with Tick-Tock culture It suffers a blow with Instagram culture and now suddenly we have people that are speaking in colloquialisms people in America that don't actually know how to speak proper English people that are trying to award people that speak in Ebonics saying this is more natural for black Americans we should be teaching ebonics as a course it drives me insane I like complete sentences I like complete words don't put a four in the middle of your restaurant name another quotation from this book is in the elegant formulation of Saint Augustine we have turned from the Creator to creatures and as a result we are wondering in the land of unlikeness which is to say a place of spiritual aridity I mean think about that quotation we have turned from the Creator to creatures I see it all over our society something that was a creation something that was full something that was whole that has become scattered that has become a sin something that has become a creature and this is what is actually even though we can identify it driving Matt Walsh crazy at the grocery store and it is what is driving me crazy I see this that we are all wandering creatures and we are suffering from the spiritual aridity that we see everywhere right people are just not whole anymore and when we talk about spirituality obviously we're talking about something that is arid and I want to impress upon you the definition of that word arid the definition is lacking interest or feeling lifeless and dull another definition is exhausted of moisture parched dry Barren that is what I see when I look around me and I see that we no longer can speak complete sentences it feels that language has become arid music has become arid we've gone from Beethoven to cardi B's music art has become arid think about that we've gone from Van Gogh to the MoMA where people are trying to sell us porcelain toilets as a form of Modern Arts and I think that as a result because everything that we see around us is is lacking this wholeness and this fullness we are starting to embody it it on the inside we are walking around like creatures that know that there is something missing and so I guess what I'm trying to say to you guys is please if you ever have a restaurant give it a proper name and if you're at the grocery store just put the cart back that's all I have to say about that it's no secret that this Administration has utterly failed when it comes to strengthening our economy and unfortunately we still have two more years of this craziness so there's no telling what that could lead to higher taxes deeper inflation I hope not but it's smart to be prepared that's why I recommend talking to Birch gold group about protecting your savings with

update to a story that we covered yesterday you know we spoke about the story of the man named Chris Christensen who was a principal of a school in California and he killed himself at Disneyland because of a fight that he had one night with his wife in which she called the cops and he claims he never put hands on her whatsoever the charges do reflect that that is true but because he was a principal of the school and he was charged with child endangerment for having this argument at least according to his Facebook post he lost his job as the principal now I was very careful in talking about that topic first and foremost because it deals with suicide and I wanted to make sure that no hate was thrown toward his wife but when we first learned about this story of course the discussions that we had before we present them to the public and we kind of debate amongst ourselves in the control room and amongst friends my inkling told me that there was more to the story in terms of the wife and I'm gonna tell you honestly I looked at a picture of her and I just thought she looked a little crazy but I didn't I didn't tell you guys that because that's ridiculous thing who could say she was definitely in the wrong because she looks a little crazy and he looked kind of like a little nice guy but you can't judge a book by its cover even though I do believe the eyes are the window to the soul now we have an update in the story and again I'm just giving you the update I still cannot confirm that there isn't another side to the story but Chris christensen's daughter who is 26 years old has spoken out and she is firmly placing blame on Marlena Marlena is the wife that called the cops an exclusive interview with interview with a daily mail she claims that Marlena was abusive and accused the divorced mother of tearing apart her family she said that she had been very difficult in our family for about the last year and we haven't had any contact with her I had just now started regaining contact with her father over the last two weeks and it's been really great he was trying to figure out how to leave her in my opinion it seems like in his mind there was no way out of this relationship she's been abusive to our entire family for five years that's why we don't have any contact with her anymore she also claimed that Marlena's story to other cops was riddled with lies she also shared vicious text messages that she herself as the daughter of Chris Christensen had received from Marlena and I'm going to read you one of those text messages which she received following an argument in April it says quote again this is from Marlena to Chris christensen's 26 year old daughter quote you're a horrible disgusting excuse for a daughter and a sister go find your dad play the hero but it's me that he will be missing in the morning uh yeah those are some strong words I would say under no scenario is it okay for a stepmom to send that to Somebody's Daughter even if the daughter is in fact a horrible person uh you just there are certain things when it comes to family that you don't do and you stay out of it as somebody who is new into the family they were only married for three years Brittany also claims that Marlena keyed her car at her apartment after the argument in which his father in which her father tried to break up with his wife and she did at the time file a police report of the incident alleging that it cost her six thousand dollars of damage and she shared photos of those scratches with the daily mail but she said ultimately that case ended up being unresolved because the mother Marlena her stepmother did not admit to anything but they had footage from her doorbell camera of her leaving the house in the middle of the night and then coming to my apartment where my dad was staying for the night and taking his car so essentially they had a lot of evidence pointing the fact that Marlena keyed her car now Marlena is an older woman King anybody's car as an older woman is completely bizarre and a bit erratic so I'm just telling you that there is more to the story The the daughter is saying that she has a consistent pattern of manipulation inappropriate behavior and that this is what ultimately led her father to committing suicide I tend to believe that but again I am not deep in the trenches of this story and perhaps there is another side and that one night for the first time in his entire life he did something that was worthy of having the police called I will leave that up to you guys to decide all right guys moving on this is a controversial opinion I think I I have already shared with you guys I think I may have done this behind the paywall that when it comes to workplace relationships I am not against them I know a lot of people are and I can totally understand why they are especially in the post metoo era especially if you're a male executive you could just think to your employees nobody to anybody we just don't want any drama but in my opinion especially as someone that's in their 30s and I see my friends that are unmarried and in their mid-20s and 30s where else do you really meet people if you're not the person who wants to go out on a Friday night and get drunk and go to the bar in a club like you did in your early 20s you spend the majority of your time at work and so it's natural in my opinion for workplace romances to Bud and I think it's a good thing I would be I would be totally okay if people that I worked with you know got into a relationship a consensual relationship and dated and maybe even potentially got married as long as they don't bring any drama in their relationship into the workplace right and my perspective is that drama happens at work no matter what so if it's drama because they were exes or if it's drama because they just don't like each other toxicity in the workplace should be dealt with accordingly so if you're divorced now and you hate each other and you're biting at work you're both going to be fired right if you don't like each other because you're once best friends and now you're fighting over someone outside of work you're both going to be fired so I don't really see an issue with workplace relationships as long as the hierarchy is appropriate meaning that I don't think it would be wise for an executive Dayton intern I think that causes a lot of other issues and and talk and that has to do with more of power structures and it could be inappropriate saying all this because obviously what's been in the Press is that TJ Holmes and Amy roback of Good Morning America had a relationship and it looks like by the way that both of them who were married and are now getting divorced were were not being they were being Infidel in their marriages and I have a problem with that personally the idea that they imploded their own marriages to be together it's wrong and you guys know how I feel about marriages and monogamy so I do not like that personally but professionally I do not see how it presents a problem and basically ABC from the executives they said that there was no violation in terms of their contracts they don't have anything in place that says explicitly that you can't you know date people inside the workplace but it has caused a firestorm in terms of people saying that it just violates the values of Disney so what we have in the news today is that a former Good Morning America executive has spoken spoken out and in case you don't know these two people they're on leave right now at work Amy roback and TJ Holmes and he has spoken out and saying he said quote the broken marriages and the cheating including the reports that TJ had another affair with the different GMA colleague is unseemly and embarrassing and a gross violation of core Disney values and so he believes that they are both potentially going to lose their jobs over this I laughed when I saw that like because this is Disney a gross violation of their values yeah probably because the two of them are heterosexual I'm just making sure this is the same Disney that wants to make everything gay at Disney World and trans your kids and make them confused about their gender let's stop pretending that Disney has values and suddenly two people that are heterosexual entering and consensual relationship is a gross violation and so I was saying when I saw the story my thought process was If Only They had both come out and said they were gay then they would have said we were just so proud of them if like if TJ Holmes came out as a gay man and just host is another man he said I'm leaving my marriage because I'm gay I realized and I'm in love with Martin next to me they would have been like we're so proud of them Sparkles sprinkles or rainbows unicorns this is amazing he's just finding out who he is that's exactly what would happen because if you haven't realized it yet there is Extreme bias and bigotry toward heterosexual couples that's what's happening right now that and and because they're hetero that because they're heterosexual is problematic but if they were gay if only TJ and Amy roback have been gay and lesbian this would have been an entirely different Scandal I do not agree with them getting into any trouble to be sending adults yes I I form I really disagree with them on a personal level they were friends of mine and I I am so such a strong support in the institution of marriage and it offends me on a personal level but professionally I don't see how this is really the business of Good Morning America in that same vein as we talk about the bigotry towards heterosexual couples I'm sure you guys have been following the Scandal I haven't actually spoken out on it because it's just so ridiculous Candace Cameron Beret she works over now at a network called Great American family and she was giving an interview in the Wall Street Journal and she talked about how happy she was that she worked for a network that would be putting traditional marriages on display great amazing it's it's so unique nowadays to see traditional marriage and values on display to see Christian values on display at all that she should be proud to work with a network that is okay with that right now every network is going the other direction they're like you gotta have something lesbian gay trans whatever but she's proud to work there and this caused an absolute Firestorm that people are saying I can't believe she said this Chief among them by the way is a girl probably saying her last name wrong JoJo siwa she used to be on that dance competition show I actually washed from a dance competition show she was super likable she then went on to have a very lucrative YouTube career because she appeals to children and she's sparkly and and great all these things are happy for her but she's come out now as a lesbian a few years ago and she has a girlfriend and so now she thinks that what we want to hear from her rather than her just making kids have fun is how much of a lesbian she is and she has attacked Candace Cameron bar this is the second time she's attacked her the first time she attacked her here is because Candace Cameron Burr didn't Beret did not see her at an event and she took it as a personal attack personally I think JoJo siwa has feelings for Candace Cameron Beret she's got some fascination with her Candace Cameron Beret apologized for not seeing her at an event and reached out to her and was very kind and accepting but now JoJo siwa is again mad at her Candace Cameron Beret because Candace Cameron Beret likes traditional marriages yeah she's like traditional marriages like you like untritional marriages you are consciously promoting your fact that you're a lesbian why can't Cameron Candace Bure promote the fact that she is a Christian conservative oh I know why JoJo because you're a bigot you think you're accepting but you're actually a bigot right you guys have got every letter Under the Sun lgbtqrstuv well how about an H in there for heterosexual how about a c in there for Christian and conservative can you guys fit a little more room in your alphabet soup to be accepting toward people who do not live that way who do not have homosexual marriage is if nobody yells at you for doing your YouTube channel and talking about your lesbian relationship with your girlfriend every five seconds maybe you could leave her alone for the work that she does and saying that I would also like to put the way that I live on display it is miraculous to me that people like Jojo siwa cannot see their own hypocrisy that they think that the only way that people have to live is exactly like them which far from making them accepting JoJo it makes you a bigot so leave Candace Cameron Beret alone She's Just Not That Into You moving on to the next story that I wanted to cover it I have been bringing to the Forefront to you this topic which again I will say every time I bring it up I get a few comments like you just don't understand how good it would be if people instead of committing suicide were assisted in suicide just like Canada I see now the comments are changing because my predictions have been true and it's getting very dark and now they are killing people who aren't even that sick people that are just an inconvenience which is obviously where this was going to lead if you are considered a financial inconvenience to the government maybe you're on Medicaid and you're getting drugs all the time they're like you're actually not producing anything in society they're going to encourage you to Simply off yourself just kill yourself we'll help you it'll be gentle and kind and compassionate but you should kill yourself so there was an article that ran saying that Canada is now euthanizing 10 000 of its citizens a year that is a lot Canada is a small country there are more people in the state of California than they are in the entirety of Canada despite its vast space they're very few people that live there so ten thousand of its own citizens a year is a lot and there are now all of these horrific stories like what I had predicted coming to the Forefront so I'm going to give you an example of one of these stories there was a paralympian athlete her name is Christine Gautier and she has come forth and said that essentially she's been in an infuriating battle to obtain a stair lift for her home obviously she's paraplegic so she needs a stair lift inside of her home so she's kind of going back and forth and she they wouldn't give her the stair lift and eventually a Canadian official told her that if her life was so difficult and she was so desperate to get this stair lip so that she can go up and down the stairs the government would just help her kill herself I'm sorry what I'm I'm asking for the government to help me get a stair lift so I can move throughout my home the government comes back and they're like well why if you're just this desperate for the stair lift why don't have you thought about just killing yourself you mean you can't move you might as well just kill yourself right that that would make more sense not right wrong that's absolutely horrific so despite being combined confined to a wheelchair with a musculoskeletal disorder which affects her legs back and hips she is still a gold medal winning para canoeist and she won a silver medal participating in Canada's women's ice Sledge hockey team so she's not this hopeless case and this person who's sitting around just asking the government to help her and even if she was a hopeless person who was sitting around asking the government for handouts which our government actually encourages right you lock down businesses and they say don't worry we'll take care of you well there may be some people that are actually taking the government up on their offer and now they're laying back and they're being lazy well what's eventually going to come down the pipe pipeline is the government is going to see you as a burden and they're going to tell you to kill yourself she was none of those things she was none of those things she has led an admirable life despite her conditions and yet she was advised to Simply kill herself so I advise you guys to look into all these stories there are tons of them another example Alan Nichols 61 year old British Colombian with a history of depression other medical issues none of them life-threatening whatsoever hospitalized in 2019 over fears that he might be suicidal they also asked him hey have you ever thought about just killing yourself feeling a little depressed yeah maybe he's feeling a little depressed there's a lot of things to be depressed about people are depressed because I don't know inflation impressed because covert lockdowns took their businesses and everything that they had well guess what you sound a little suicidal do you want a pill to kill yourself do you want us to help you die this is really scary and it's dystopian and there's no such thing as saying well only for some cases of terminal illness maybe this should be okay it's not the way it ever works the government guys you just have to get this through your heads you give the government an inch they will always take a mile my I advise that we never give the government an inch inside every Progressive is a totalitarian screaming to get out and the team at front page magazine has been unmasking these totalitarians since the earliest days of the internet founded by

always be my hill to die on and I will constantly communicate to you guys things that you should just be aware of we had received a comment from someone on Instagram that said Candace have you seen what's going on with Spotify type in two commas and porn pops up but that can't possibly be true I tried it my executive producer tried it it is 100 True hardcore porn pops up on Spotify if you type into commas I'm not sure why I'm not sure why that would work if you put in two commas but it does in fact work so if you're thinking oh my child is not watching porn I have all these Protections in place because we know how bad porn is for people's minds and what it does people's frontal cortex over time well beware that if your child has Spotify they can be accessing hardcore porn so I just wanted to quickly deliver you guys that fact and that is all that I will say on that all right now it's time for your comments so let's Dive Right In and see what you have for me first couple of comments are pertaining to the question that I asked yesterday which is when is it appropriate for women to call the police on men a couple of interesting comments this one's from Jen she said I also wonder where to draw the line my husband soon to be ex-husband screams at the top of his lungs literally rattles the windows of our house punched a hole in the bedroom door pulled my daughter out of the bathroom by her shirt but hasn't ever really hurt us now getting divorced I have no police report nothing to show my deep concern for my kids safety so I do the right thing by never calling it was always so borderline yeah that's a tricky spot to be and for me personally man pulling my daughter at all I'm like I'm out I have such strong opinions on that there is no reason for a man to ever touch a woman in any regard I mean pulling your daughter by the shirt especially that how traumatizing is that for a young woman I am a big believer that the way in which you treat your daughter is what she will come to accept in relationships and it's the reason why I have like never had a relationship where I have a lot of men to yell at me one in high school when I was super young but never in my adult years more adult years in my 20s I've ever had anybody help me relationship because my dad didn't yell at me growing up so it's weird to me if a guy raises his voice I'm like are you good you need a walk or what are you what are you doing or saying why are you yelling you're completely out of control and the concept of somebody my sweet little angel baby Louise of a man grabbing her by her shirt in front of me uh yeah I would call the cops and I would say you're gonna have to come get me because I'm about to kill him so call the cops on myself if somebody put their hands on my sweet little baby Louise next comment this one is from Frank Boykin on the same topic he says the only time it is okay to call the cops is if you are in physical danger or you want the other person dead my ex-wife and I had an argument 22 years ago I'm 47 now and still because I have a domestic violence record over a simple argument she bills me out of jail and even told the judge at the time that she didn't want to press charges he said it was not up to her anymore till this day I cannot get a job that requires a background check and so for the last 15 years I've been basically homeless because you have to do a background check to get any kind of housing so I pretty much lost my life and rights over an argument a simple argument that was corrected the next day so now I have in my mind if someone today threatens to call the police in my mind you just put in a life and death situation so my life is worth more than theirs that is a very valid concern and that was my point in bringing the question to women a man can lose his entire life I think sometimes people don't understand that when once you call the cops you can't undo that action right so you call the cops and you can't go oh never mind I was a little bit upset the second thing arrive they are able to assess and Take Over Control the situation entirely that is that is what it means to call the police and so even if you have calmed down in the 45 minutes took them to get to your house it doesn't matter at that point they can say why were we even called obviously it's you're using taxpayer dollars why are we even called something obviously was wrong is she now lying because he has asserted control over her and I'm not blaming the cops in this scenario because they don't know what's happened they don't know what's transpired because there are some domestic violence situations where the women lie to protect the men and then once you're in a legal system of course it's not advantageous for men and that is horrible to think that you have had to deal with this your entire life because of one decision that she made in a you know a flash in the pan decision and yeah I think it's sad it's why I want to talk to women about it women that listen to this podcast is to really think that through it's a big difference between a man grabbing your daughter by her shirt and you and a guy just getting into an argument and you can break up with him and say I don't like the way you speak to me because that's that's what I would do I would say I'm not tolerating this whatsoever I don't like the way you speak to me and now we're not in a relationship so there is my personal opinion on it this has been a hard year on the economy and that means an essential practical gifts will be in high demand this year and that is why I recommend gifting Meat and seafood from good Ranchers with discounts on orders of five boxes or more you can save on gifts for the whole family when you give a box of good ranchers you're giving them a true Steakhouse experience with 100 American USDA prime and upper Choice cuts of beef Chicken and Seafood other meat delivery companies and even your local grocery store Imports lower Quality Meat from overseas don't give your friends and family less than America's best this year and if you're not sure what to order good ranchers now offers gift cards so you can let your friends and family members choose for themselves or you can give the gift of a subscription and inflation proof someone's grocery bill go to goodranchors.com and use code Candace at checkout to get 35 off your gift that's good ranchers.com code Candace for 35 off good ranchers American Meat delivered the next comments are about yesterday I shared with you guys my stalker story I read so many of your comments I was so shocked by how many people also survive stalking situations and I do also want to clarify because some people said Candace this doesn't just happen to celebrities and you're right I did not mean to imply that whatsoever uh people that are insane are insane it doesn't really matter whether or not you're a celebrity this person wrote women being stalked in the UK have to wait until they're physically attacked before any actual Intervention when it comes to Violent relationships women and their kids Bounce Around women's refugees because refuges party because unless actual harm is caused there's nothing the police can do but bounce them around the country not enough is done to protect women from stalkers as well as abusive exes I completely agree with asylums I've struggled with mental illness for almost a decade and but there's a difference between the mentally ill and the mentally insane protecting good people should always come before psychotics psychotic feelings nobody should be abused obviously but every institution has abuse still to this day so it's difficult to tackle such a topic you are correct I really love the idea that we need to understand there's difference between someone that's mentally ill and mentally insane person that I dealt with is mentally insane and this is not a person that can be brought back to reality and that's been proven time and time again and also you are that's a very valid point that every institution still has abuse I mean I shared my birth story I did the hospitals now I've taken over the insane asylums and they treat women like they're insane when they give birth and then they don't want you to leave the hospital and they want to get the bills up so it's still taking place there's kind of been this this transfer to the hospital the hospitals now have those same powers to put you on a psych 5150 hold and to do whatever they want to you so it's almost like they just satisfied this social need of we don't want insane asylums put more women at risk and then transferred power over to the hospitals do the same thing to be able to abuse patients so I've agree with you 100 cerebella on the same topic says my thoughts and prayers go out to anyone who has gone through such an experience one thing I learned from my therapist is to never refer to a stalker as my but I had a in their sick minds they can see that as an attachment still wanting to take power from someone who tried to tarnish yours is not only uplifting but extremely cathartic that's great I that is probably great advice from your therapist I never really saw a therapist about it and you're probably right that when you say my they kind of see that as a relationship but the thing is is that he thought every single one of my tweets said everything that I said was somehow related to him so whether or not I use the word my or not in my particular stalking circumstance wasn't going to make a difference but I think of that is great advice for other people very valid advice next comment is regarding Botox gate did you guys see the entire Crossing yesterday I was on tiger cross and talking about botoxy and how shocked I was that women were so passionately angry that men basically said we like you naturally but women think that you know Botox helps it makes them feel more confident and I'm a big person that whatever makes you happy if you like it I love it you know I was not at all trying to attack women I just wanted to know what men in particular thought about but look because I I wanted to essentially use the scientific method of Instagram and Twitter to kind of assess whether or not women were doing something that was attracting men or doing something that was detracting men Carolina says I always ask my husband if he'd get mad if I ever got Botox he says he would because I don't need it and it brings up my mom as an example by saying how pretty she looks without getting Botox or any of those things little does he know that she has been getting botox for like 10 years I love you Candace this topic just is not your Forte just like it isn't for men a good Botox job is one where you can't even tell and trust me you literally can't tell it's there Instagram models and influencers are not a good example I heard you guys loud and clear you guys think that I don't know anything about Botox guys I haven't said anything about Botox I just asked Ben the question and that is why the reaction became so funny and like botox gate because men were just saying they don't like it and women were angry at men for saying they don't like it and then there were examples of people that were showing pictures of like see you can't tell but men could tell and they are what that they're saying is that I get in your circumstance he can't tell but a lot of men can tell and they're just trying to be polite which is what members saying is that they can tell because what happens is the forehead is too clear and the face moves and at a certain point it starts to look weird that you can't wrinkle so I am totally in agreement that I am not educated about Botox I do not get it but I think it is fair to ask men their opinions without just assuming that they're all too stupid to recognize it even if a few of them are as a whole and we're talking about a 99.89 percent of men that came back and said they don't like it and then a few said well if it's Tastefully done and those few happen to be people that were injecting the botox they were actually doctors they were estheticians so I don't be mad at the way men feel about it don't be mad at me for asking the question but I hear you the next comment is from another person that goes by dkg hardtails I believe a lot of women do it to compete with other women to outdo each other men at least men who are respectable and pay attention we love natural it's appealing and also it's real in a world where you don't know what to believe we like to be with a woman who we know is 100 real who looks natural I would rather a woman who looks her age than a 50 year old who has had worked on and now looks like a 24 year old lizard it was another element of this where a lot of men said when I see a woman and they can tell that she's had Botox is they start to wonder about her inner peace and that it signals to them that this is a woman that is vain or is this or is that and again I'm not agreeing with that I'm just sharing with you guys what men said resoundingly in the comments section when I asked this question is that they think the woman is not whole especially if she's too young to be getting it so uh Mike cernovich as just one example who has a following on Twitter he's an author and he said that to him if he sees a girl that's beneath the age of 30 getting Botox she immediately assumes that she's 40 because why would somebody at the age of 30 be getting Botox and women think that it's just maintenance and doing a couple of tweaks here and there but he thinks that it actually makes them look older and a lot of men agreed with that now can there be Botox that's Tastefully done of course I know people that have got Botox and it's so tasteful done that you I would not be able to tell but the thing is those people tend to be young and I think that as you get older it becomes a little more obvious because most people have some lines and some movement in their forehead as they age again I'm not the expert and so I'd like to back away peacefully from this topic because as I said guys just be very clear so many of my friends at Botox so it was not at all meant to be an attack I know one of my girlfriends says you basically launched a war on white women and it's because it's not fair because you're black and black don't crack and no I just was curious in it and I do feel very strongly against everyone that's getting the same face and that was kind of I think what a lot of men were responding to as well which is that a lot of women are all starting to look the same it's like somebody decided on a standard of beauty maybe that person was Kylie Jenner or something and everyone just kind of went for that face and because there's so many trans people that are getting that much work done men who even say they used to like it now say that they are not sure if they're looking at a man or a woman because everyone kind of has that same you know face when you go onto Instagram and I was only fascinated by the topic because you guys know on this podcast I cover our psychological immune systems and US constantly being online and to use a phrase from a psychologist we're taking in these digital talk toxins and I think that women are in many ways more susceptible to those digital toxins because we are more aesthetic and that when we start to see people looking a certain way we start to look at ourselves not the right way so all I'm saying is everybody's beautiful I love everybody I don't want any beef in these streets profiling surveillance data harvesting there are a lot of things that I do not like about the big Tech Giants but there's only so much I can do I

going to be talking about a strange Twitter account called pup ravage where members of the army are posting photos of themselves in pup play Kink costume so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "ipEXhvE15TU": "happy Tuesday everybody okay question of the day really the question from yesterday I caused women online to have what I can only describe as an implosion because I directed a question for men here's what I tweeted and here's what I posted on Instagram I wrote serious question for men do you think that the botox filler fake lips look is attractive do you envision long-term relationships with girls that look that way male opinions only please people did not understand the assignment women saw this and said no no no we will be weighing in we'll be weighing in on this Candace because men don't understand the question and of course men all very much did understand the question I asked women just weren't happy with what they had to say we're going to get into that later on in the show but first up a story that has divided the daily Wire by the daily wire I mean the people in the control room I feel a certain way they feel a certain way basically if you have missed it in the news there is a principle of a school and a former principal because he committed suicide after he and his wife had an argument and she called the cops yeah let's talk about that all that and more today on Candace Owens okay so when if ever and of course there are many circumstances when it is appropriate but what is it appropriate for women to involve the police when they are in a dispute with a man the reason why that question is on my mind is because there was a story yesterday that seems to have divided the men and the women that I have asked the question to the story is pertaining to a man named Chris Christensen he was 51 years old and he was the principal of William T Newland Elementary School in Huntington Beach California he took his own life at Disneyland which he he basically jumped to his death but in a final post on Facebook he said why he committed suicide and I'm going to read you the post verbatim because I want your opinions on it and I will prep You by saying I don't have an answer to this one I just have a lot of thoughts I'd like to share I'd like to keep the dialogue going because I think it is an important dialogue to have about the judicial system as it pertains to men so here was his post his final post I hate when people leave this earth with so many unanswered questions so I hope this provides some insight and perspective this is my my wife Marlena Yes you heard me correctly most of you don't know this but we privately married three and a half years ago Marlena and I love and adore each other and our relationship has been amazing up until recently unfortunately two weeks ago she and I got into a heated argument at home in front of the girls tempers were flared and strong words were exchanged between us however never in this exchange did I hit slap or hurt Marlena in any manner nor did I ever touch the girls I never have and never will I love the girls like my own and they know that as does everyone else who truly knows me unfortunately Marlena's anger got the best of her that night and she called the police which landed me in jail that night yes me a man who has never hit or harmed anyone in his life I think it's safe to say that Marlena truly regrets making that call because the events of that night have completely unraveled both of our Lives I I am on the brink of losing my job as I am out on administrative leave until my case is quote unquote resolved however the legal system is extremely flawed especially against men and fathers and it's sickening how quickly and easily an innocent man can be thrown in jail based on zero evidence or proof in fact take a look at the attached screenshots of Marlena's message to my friend about the matter she too had no intention of having that night come this far she knows I would never hurt her or the girls and she too has been trying to clear my name with little success again the legal system is deeply flawed to say the least so here I am writing my final Facebook post to all of you I need you all to know that a gentle kind loving and sincerely good man has been destroyed by one unfortunate night it really is unfortunate this is not me this is not something that I ever thought would happen to me with all of this said I have truly loved educating and leading thousands of students and families as a principal in the fvsd for the past 21 plus years I have made so many wonderful connections with families over the years and those who know me closely know how much I cared for my students staff and families please remember me for all the good that I brought to the world of Education now the post had a couple of more paragraphs in which she just sort of said Thank you to his bandmates he also played an instrument and went around and this post was met with an outpouring of love from the community itself apparently he was a much loved principal very involved with children and when I read this post I was deeply saddened for it it seemed like an absolute tragedy so here's what I'm going to say a couple of things I first want to be very clear it is not at all the fault of this woman involved who called the police and he committed suicide it is so ridiculous to ever think that when somebody commits suicide you should blame somebody else these are the actions of one person and I think that it's important to state that over and over again that as we discuss a situation I in no way believe that it is Marlena's fault that the situation that she led him to his death because she called the police that's just simply not what happened and I feel very sad and compassionate for her because she is now dealing with a tragedy of somebody who she has expressed after his death was the love of her life she is resp she had responded to some people that responding to this post and she said he was love of my life you guys don't understand and so they obviously had a very loving relationship and something bad happened second thing I'm going to say is that I want to take this post at face value I know our minds tend to go into conspiracy land some people were commenting saying oh this seems manipulative it seems like you know he is trying to make us think that she's wrong how could he blame her yes I don't think it's it's nice to as a final post say my wife's temper got the best of her and she made a mistake and called the police of course that's not a good feeling at all but I want to be clear that I want to take this post at face value because I don't necessarily think that he posted this to be manipulative because when people use suicide to be manipulative they don't actually commit suicide he actually then committed suicide after posting this he has no history of being suicidal they have no history of being violent together for what I can discern from just doing a cursor research of him obviously if he had some history of being violent he would not have been able to serve as a teacher for 21 plus years I would think that that would immediately make you you not able to become the principal of a school if they obviously do very severe background checks when it comes to principles now this circumstance is particularly different because the child endangerment charge that he faced he faced simple battery and child endangerment so I want to clarify for you what those things mean if you have an argument in front of your children and you call the police and the police arrive of course if the police want to charge you with something they can charge you with child endangerment that's just the way it is simple battery it varies definition from state to state but it can be just menacing Behavior so if you're yelling at someone I did just for the sake of this episode look up what the simple battery California Penal Code was the definition that's coming up is a battery charge definition says that simple battery occurs when a person unlawfully touches another person the touching that occurs and is considered simple battery does not have to actually cause any harm or injury so I I again I have no idea what happened in this circumstance he could have put his hands on her saying you need to calm down whatever it is she was upset she called the police there were no injuries he did not beat her he did not beat the children he's not being charged with that but again if you have an argument in front of your children it can be considered child endangerment that's a very heavy charge for a man to face ever in life but when you are a principal that can that can spell the end of your career obviously you cannot just have a lingering child endangerment Clause uh child endangerment case in the background that's going to let you just keep continuing being the principal uh to minors and so obviously for him men have a higher way higher suicide rate in society than women and lots of times that suicide rate is directly contributed to their career I think it is fair to say that men attach their self-worth to what they're able to provide in society right their self-worth I think is tied to whether or not they have a job when a man a man does not have a job and is unable to provide they do tend to go through bouts of depression again I am making generalizations of course there are probably a lot of specific things that happen in this case case but it got my mind churning and I would like for you guys to give me your opinion first of all I want to say this I came from a household where my parents screamed to each other more my mother screaming at my dad a lot of people grow up in households where one or both parents screaming each other I have friends who are in loving marriages when they get into a fight they scream at each other it's just what they do and they do it in front of their children I think it takes a lot of emotional maturity for people to realize it's not good to yell in front of your kids me and my husband don't do it I'm grateful for that we don't yell in general I'm one of those people that when I get very angry screaming to me always signals that somebody is out of control if I ever get into a circumstance where I feel like I want to scream I will go have a workout I'll remove myself until I calm down we just don't yell at my household it's just not something that we do which I'm very proud of but I also don't be garage people that do I think that especially if you grow up in a household where you see people yelling it does one of two things to you it either makes you want to yell because you go I this is normal I don't understand what the problem is I recall having an ex-boyfriend who yelled at me for the first and last time not because I left him but I said if you ever scream again I will be gone he was so surprised that I had such a strong reaction to him yelling because his parents always yelled at each other he thought that that was an acceptable form of communication when you were passionate and I said it's not an acceptable form of communication the other way is it works like it did for me I don't want to yell in my household because I know I just didn't feel good as a kid to see your parents yelling at each other to see your parents in a shouting match I didn't like that so I did not want to then when I had the opportunity to emulate that in any fashion but again I don't want to make it seem like now yelling is just akin to physical violence and that every couple that yells it means that their children are forever going to be ruined and things of that nature I think there's a little more Nuance to the situation I think people should Aspire not to yell at each other and I always tell my friend hey you shouldn't do that you really should not yell in front of your kids or even make snippy remarks I don't think it's healthy for chill children but I also know that children are tougher than you give them credit for and sometimes in the circumstance of me you're better off for it because you don't emulate that in your own households now the reason why I think his point is something that is worth discussing when he talks about the legal system being flawed again the legal system is deeply flawed he says particularly as it pertains to men I believe that and that's not to say that there are not instances in which the legal system is flawed for women there are many instances and we're going to talk about that in topics du jour particularly when it comes to women that are being stalked there are so many flaws but I think now we are sort of sort of heading toward a society where and I think this is sort of the post me too Society I would almost say if we could Market the post me to society where I don't know if women are accurately um I want to say assessing I want to be very careful in choosing my words here uh what is violence what is a threat we now live in a society we're not just women men too we'll say silence is violence somebody's presence can feel threatening you can feel unsafe I'm not kidding I once was in front of an editor at Vogue who said that she felt unsafe because I was in the room you hear I hear this word actually a lot when I'm on college campuses that kids think that if they say they don't feel safe because Candice is coming to speak that they feel threatened by me just being there that that should somehow make it legitimate their claims that I shouldn't be allowed on their campus because they don't feel safe right it's on a safe space we're kind of sort of living a society now of safe spaces right and so I don't know what happened in this scenario so I don't want to at all condemn this woman whatsoever but if we take this at face value right assuming that everything he said in this post was true is it appropriate when you and your husband are having a fight for you to call the police when is it appropriate when you and your husband are exchanging uh a verbal fight a verbal assault on one another is it appropriate for you to call the police now you might say maybe she or any other person again I don't want to be too specific because I feel terrible terribly compassionate for this woman who is now dealing with a suicide and her children are are dealing with this there's a lot going on but if you are a woman and you are thinking okay well maybe a woman might think that those words are going to transpire into something physical so she called the police right just to sort of say okay he might start hitting me so it's a good time to call the police is there not something else like if you call the police it's going to take at least 45 minutes for them to get there so if he's going to be physically violent he's still going to have the opportunity to do that my personal instinct is that if I felt unsafe because a guy was yelling I would remove myself from the situation and I would remove my children from the situation right and then if I really thought this guy is violent I would call the police because I'm not going back into that house right but if I'm calling the police because we're just exchanging words maybe I'm not thinking through what the consequences could be for this individual again these consequences are extreme for him because of his job in his career and obviously has spiraled into a suicide not her fault whatsoever but worth a conversation worth the conversation as we are sort of entering into the society where everything is violence everything is a threat to safety everything we nothing is normal anymore anybody getting mad losing their temper is seen as oh my gosh you know we're sort of I always say we we over therapeut right everything is a form of therapy now it's well how did it make you feel when they said that right oh my gosh well this child has suffered a trauma because they saw adults yelling is that traumatic yeah it's also traumatic to see your dad taken away in a cop car right it's not removing the trauma it's it's it's compounding the trauma to see your dad taking away in a cop car and having them spend night in jail if it was in fact just a verbal argument so again I'm bringing this to the Forefront because it has led to spirited debates with everybody that I've asked I was asking my husband we thought about this asking my cousin I've asked my team and none of us really have an answer to it and maybe that is the answer that they're that everything is nuanced when it comes to this but I do think think that it is legitimate to say that in this regard when we are talking about abuse when we're talking about children uh the legal system does tend to condemn men immediately in the post-metu era so it wasn't always that way I think the legal system used to very much favor men but I do think that we've seen a shift in the last few years want to hear your thoughts but that's all that I'll say about that it is no exaggeration to say that becoming a mother has been one of the greatest joys of my life being able to bring life into this world is a miracle that every mother and child deserves unfortunately our society has brainwashed us into believing that these precious lives are nothing more than a clump of cells that is why I am so excited to let you guys know that my show has partnered with pre-born pregnancy clinics pre-born is a pro-life Ministry that provides ultrasounds to women who are considering abortion because when a mother sees their child and hears their heartbeat she will more often than not choose life the work they are doing is so important and I want to share a client testimonial with you so you can hear it from one of the mother's own words take a listen to Olivia's story so Race's father is he was my mentor we met working at the shop I was comfortable being alone with him I thought we were good friends I kind of took that as an opportunity to just get to know him on a deeper level I guess he wasn't interested in that he was more interested in the physical aspect of everything when I found out I was pregnant he was not okay with that either he pushed for an abortion and that's how I came to the clinic so I felt like the only ones that were really there for me were the women at the clinic and it actually did Empower me and help me I was late enough to get my ultrasound still remember you know feeling everything um is changing I said I would not get an abortion so I was going to raise this baby with or without him so he said without I think if I didn't find the clinic then I probably would have considered abortion the women there are just so kind they're just so genuine I would not be this strong without the clinic my dreams now revolve around my son I want to let people know that it's not over no matter what age you are you know you find out you're pregnant it's not over and that there's there are places to go and I want the individuals that are involved in the clinic to know how much we are all eternally grateful for everything that they do if I did abort my son I would live with many regrets now that I have them I don't think I can be in this world without him my son saved me I can honestly say that changed my life for the better isn't that amazing it's so powerful to hear these women's testimonies over the past 16 years pre-born has counseled over 450 000 women that are considering abortion and they have saved more than 188 000 babies when preborn introduces expectant mothers to their children via ultrasound eighty percent of the time she is more likely to choose life than an abortion my show is on a mission to rescue 1500 babies before the end of this year and so far together we have already saved 378 lives which is amazing so I know that we can do it one ultrasound cost just 28 you can sponsor five ultrasounds for 144 dollars however some of you may be in a position to give even more and I encourage you to do that if you can through a match program going on right now your tax deductible gift is doubled whatever you donate you're saving twice as many children to donate securely dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby that's pound 250 baby or go to preborn.com Candace that's preborn.com Candace if you consider yourself pro-life now is the time to act help us save 1500 babies at preborn.com Candace today okay now it's time for some topics to show so yes I do believe that in many instances the legal system is not fair to men but there are some instances where I strongly feel the legal system is not fair to women and one such category where I see that is when it comes to stalking women that are being stalked and so I'm going to do something rare on this show and I'm going to strongly defend Kim Kardashian and all of her sisters I've seen a lot of these cases come up as it pertains to the Kardashians and I've stayed mum on them because I had a situation that happened with Maple chain to a stalker that I'm going to share for the first time now that we are years Beyond it but it was not fun when I was going through it but yesterday in the news Kim Kardashian received a restraining order against a man who believed that he was communicating telepathically with her she obtained the restraining order this is just her latest stalker by the way against a man named Andre Prasad and that was granted on Monday in La he's forbidden now from contacting her coming within 100 yards of her he showed up at her home three times claimed to be armed and insisted that the two were communicating telepathically and she was worried that he could become physically violent that is terrifying terrifying just imagine in your home where you should feel the most safe you have a man that keeps showing up he's armed and he is saying that the two of you are communicating telepathically this man is obviously very insane and this has happened again over and over again to her her sister Kendall Jenner I've read cases her sister Kylie and we tend to sort of glean over these cases without giving it much so I go it's another stalker's famous person they deal with it like that's just a part that's just the price of Fame and it's no it's not just the price of Fame this is a mentally traumatizing situation to go through and Kobe Bryant's daughter has also recently been in the press for the same circumstance so she is 19 years old her name is Natalia and she claims that her stalker has an obsession with her and guns and has been living under the delusion that they are in a relationship and she says the harassment has been going on for two years and escalating he recently showed up at USC which is where she goes to school creeping around the buildings where she takes classes and he even showed up at her sorority house what's especially scary is that he has been convicted of at least four crimes including one involving a Firearms you are talking about a girl on a college campus who has a man that is talking to her showing up where she lives and where she is taking classes this is a child I mean she's she's so young she's 19 years old you know I guess just became an adult but she's 19 years old and you should never have that experience a traumatizing experience simply because you are the daughter of somebody who was incredibly famous this is what happens people will see famous people online and if they are in fact insane they will convince themselves that there is some sort of relationship that they are having with them now I said I wanted to talk about this because I went through something a couple of years ago that it still traumatizes me but I'm finally ready to talk about it I'm scared to talk about it which is a part of it is that a lot of these women are under even more duress because the first thing that police officers tell you is not to say anything publicly about it because it could further set that individual off and that's a scary place to be in you're not supposed to talk about it you're supposed to pretend it's not happening and hope that the police are going to do something so for me it started about two years ago right before my son was born while I was pregnant I had a young man who went by two names uh he was schizophrenic who began sending me documents of his psych 5150 hold basically his discharge document from the hospital and he would write about 40 emails a day saying to me you know like I know Candace that I was in the hospital because you somehow convinced them that we weren't in a relationship you know that we're in a relationship you put me there how could you possibly do this to me you know what we have just truly believed that he and I had some sort of relationship and that he was in the hospital because I was lying to his doctors about the relationship that we had So that obviously instantly flagged me this I'm doing with an actual crazy person the emails became more and more aggressive I gave birth to my child he basically wrote to me and said I forgive you for you know accidentally becoming pregnant with another man and that we're going to raise this child together and everything's going to be fine and his personality would oscillate from extremely angry at me to extremely loving and telling me that he forgave me and he had convinced himself that every single thing that I wrote publicly and said publicly was directed to him so I'll give an example I could tweet something like only women can give birth pertaining clearly to the transgender a transgendered agenda and he would come back and write an email and say I saw you wrote this yes we're going to be happy and have children I could tweet something Trump 2024 and he would somehow see as if it was like a code between me and him he would sometimes how think that it meant signaled something to him that I had to communicate via code and it was increasingly bizarre increasingly scary and things really culminated when a this was right when I moved to Tennessee he began sending me emails again he had two names he had his real name and then a pseudonym and he sent me emails of a link to Eminem's song which you guys remember Stan needed that song with Dido and the video the song is about a crazed fan who convinces himself that he is receiving hate because he never gets an answer from this person he's obsessed with and then he ends up killing his wife and his child and he sent me a link to that and he said this is going to be our ending that was terrifying again we have the cops involved but the cops kept saying to me well there's nothing that we can do until he does something think about that there's nothing that we can do until we actually physically hurts you so him sending you this song and threatening to hurt you doesn't mean anything things culminated when uh after moving to Tennessee he sent me a photo of him with a gun on his lap and said that he was coming to me and it turned out that he had escaped his mental facility which was holding him now my understanding of the laws surrounding these mental facilities depending I think I believe it's state by state but where he was essentially they can only hold you for so long and this is because years ago there was a very liberal fight to end mental to end insane asylums now was there some rightful reason for that yes of course people were being abused and insane asylums we know that they were testing drugs on people that were clinically insane that our government was using them and experimenting on them which is horrible and horrific a lot of women that were in the same time were sometimes sexually abused so they put an end to insane asylums but then what happened is that people that are actually insane now are able to roam the streets freely so there are all these laws governing this person can only be held maybe for 30 days for 60 days and then you have to release them because these are the rights for mentally insane people well there are victims at the end of those rights for mentally insane people some people are actually clinically insane and should not be allowed to Simply roam free in society and send pictures of guns on their lap and say that I'm coming for you so once he left the mental facility obviously thankfully we were alerted immediately it made the press that he escaped and it was a very compassionate Post in the Press which was just you know we're looking for this person he may need mental help if anybody sees him and every single day where they did not find him I was living in a mental prison I have never I am not a fearful person I get death threats every day online I think most of those people are absolute Chumps you know who just don't have the courage would never have the courage to say things face to face to me but when somebody believes that they are in a relationship with you similar to what Kim Kardashian is going through what Kobe Bryant's daughter Natalia Bryant is going through it is another level it is they're not living in the realm of reality right and so he is trying to find me they don't know where he is is every minute I didn't want to leave my house I had an event I remember at Turning Point USA we were on high alert I didn't want to do a meet and greet I didn't want to see anybody because I was so fearful that what was going to happen to me would be similar to what happened to that former American Idol Star I believe her name was Christina grimey maybe it's a Christina Grimmie um and she was at a meet and greet and a fan stalker fan who was sending her weird tweets shot her and killed her and she died in her brother's arms and I just kept replaying that scenario in my head and was so paranoid in believing that I was going to die because I didn't know where he was and he was just going to shoot me in public and so that is when I got Security in place we were on high security alert but nothing there's no way that I can communicate to you how traumatic that is to to go through not only as a mother but as an individual as a woman just really believing you don't know where this insane person is he has sent you threats telling you was going to kill you and the cops are telling you if they can't arrest him and they can't do anything because he hasn't actually killed you yet right it's just a threat it's just an email there's nothing we can do and they're frustrated though I'm not trying to say cops are wrong here because they are just doing what they're legally allowed to do they're they're saying they are not legally allowed to arrest him for sending a picture of a gun in his lap and saying that he's headed towards me right and fortunately for me what ended up happening was they had guessed that he wouldn't be able to get too far because his mother and father were in communication not with him but with the police and said that he has no money he has no money how far can he really get and I'm thinking he can get on a bus you can get pretty far you can bum cash and get over to Tennessee and what ended up happening was that he went to a blood bank to donate blood in exchange for cash and they because they had him in the system he was captured there the police showed up and they took him back to wherever he was living in a mental home of some description who knows how long they can hold him there but they at least know that he is stalking somebody and that I will be the first one to learn if he ever leaves again makes me feel a little okay now that some time has passed but it's a scary thing to go through as a person a public figure because there are people that are actually insane and it is why I am not uh in support of the idea that there should not be insane asylums I do believe that a lot of women would be alive today if our legal system was better and if there were a place where people that are displaying very clear signs of clinical Insanity that they're not living in the same realm as us most these individuals now just end up on the streets these are the kind of individuals that randomly throw a woman into the subway station right throw in front of the train tracks and she dies like as what's been happening a lot in New York City there have been a lot of these random crimes from homeless people because if they weren't homeless these people would probably be in insane asylums so I did want to shift to also talking about a lot of issues that I see in the legal system as it pertains to women and launch a rare defense for Kim Kardashian and her sisters and just make you guys aware that stuff like that happens moving on to another story since we are talking about homicide and suicide today I think I'm talking about in a productive manner though right you guys still feel happy I hope while Elon Musk has come out and he says that he is not suicidal Elon Musk has felt necessary to make it clear to individuals that he is not suicidal and if you've been listening to the show you know that I have been very clearly covering strange death circumstances surrounding people that are perceived as a threat to the government cryptocurrency obviously a huge threat to the monetary system uh that is in place and there have been Wars that have been launched if they feel that the monetary system is being threatened that their control over all the banking system and all the money in the world is being threatened a lot of times you will see that they will just say oh this person's a terrorist and suddenly that person gets killed so we know that's happening with amongst crypto millionaires one who we covered last week who literally tweeted that he was going to be killed by the CIA and the Mossad and four hours later he was found dead with his wallet and in the middle of the ocean fully clothed so we don't know what happened there but Elon Musk does feel it's necessary to say that he is not suicidal he said this while addressing the Twitter files leak obviously that is a huge threat to the government and the DNC and people that have been communicating telling Twitter and other social media companies they must control the speech they must control the flow of information to accomplish their own ends they want everybody to roll up their sleeves and get a vaccine well they need to make sure that the social media companies are staying in line and censoring speech and that every time someone says I had a reaction to the vaccine or my Administration changed because of the vaccine that that person is taken off of the platforms and called a liar that a post has gone up and saying missing context right this is where fact Checkers come into place fact Checkers we know are acting they are bad faith actors that are working with in my opinion government agencies right they because it just seems strange that these social media platforms are seem to be supporting exactly furthering the ends of big Pharma the FDA the CDC they are basically saying that you must get in line you cannot question the science we are of Science and so now that Elon Musk is revealing all that corruption it is fair to assume that they could come after him and while I don't think that they would suicide him right because I think he is way too big to be suicided I do think what I could see happening is that the FBI swoops in and takes all the servers of Twitter and that they try to impoverish him and that they tie him up in the legal system and that they accuse him of crimes they never committed I could 100 percent see that being the protocol of how they deal with sound like an Elon Musk that is not helping them to further censor the flow of information and so he said quote I do not have any Suicidal Thoughts if I commit suicide it's not real terrifying terrifying he talked about his safety in general and he said quote maybe I should be more worried than I am but I think generally if you do right by the people you have the people on your side there is no question that people are on Elon musk's side the bigger question is whether or not the government is on his side and I think that it's very clear that they're not they have indicated that they find Twitter to be problematic that people the bad faith journalists are already writing Twitter is over and Twitter resistant Twitter is that and trying to make it seem like it's this hostile social media uh company that is being run by far right fascists and Nazis and in reality all it is is something that is not under their control so I just wanted to bring that to the Forefront that Elon Musk is not in fact suicidal but he should be expecting some horrible things to happen to him in my opinion from the FBI because they are not fighting domestic terrorism that's obvious every time there is a shooting or a bomb that goes off the person is always on the API list the FBI just want them fall for their cracks let there be a grandma walking through the capitol questioning the results of the free and fair election which we now know was no longer free or Fair because the government was censoring speech and censoring information uh yeah that woman's gonna spend some hard time in prison maybe the FBI are the domestic terrorists there's an idea and I'll just leave you with that idea alright guys I want to take a second to talk to you about Bond charge formerly called Blue blocks they

not going to believe the story this is my light-hearted story and it involves a lady with extremely extremely big boobs this woman that is on Tick Tock and saying that she is being slut-shamed for breastfeeding in public just because she's busty now if you're listening to this podcast I implore you to find this on YouTube because you need to just see this woman I'm going to show you a picture of her looks to be a size Z if they make that size she has enormous just enormous breasts and she's breastfeeding looks to be about two years old fully topless she just like when she wants to breastfeed she just takes her whole top off it looks like she's in a store she's pushing the cart she's smiling I don't even know it's taking a picture of her she's proud she's just holding them just holding her sizey boobs and shoving into her kid's face and it's like I'm just a mom you can't hate this my child's hungry and so it the hashtag of course that she's using is normalized breastfeeding right who cares I'm at I'm walking through Target and my child says he's hungry I'm just gonna take my whole top off and I'm gonna shove my double Z's into his mouth and you better take it and understand that there's something wrong with you because you don't think that it's normal for me to do that well it's because it isn't normal for you to do that okay I brushed about two kids I never had to take my whole top off in the middle of Target to feed them right it's not a normal behavior and I'm so sick of women who are trying to kind of repurpose this as some form of feminism like moms are just trying to feed the kids it's like there are a lot of natural bodily functions that take place that would be bizarre right if we just did them because immediately there was an urgency right like people generally have to go to the bathroom right imagine if every time you had to pee you just went pull down your pants in the middle of the aisle and you just peed and sleep and said normalize peeing normalize going number one which is normal I had or had to pee I'm nine months pregnant why is that normal I take my pants off what's wrong is you thinking that it's weird that I'm peeing at Target not the fact that I'm doing in public not like I couldn't just even though there was an urgency make it to the bathroom to privatize this that's what she's doing it's gaslighting people right it's going you're just you're not normal what I'm doing is totally normal it's totally normal but I go potty sometimes in Target what's abnormal is that you guys are so civilized and you think it's not okay for me to do that have a little bit of decency ladies honestly I'm so sick of this weird Trend people pretend it's just not normal for people to go hey that's a little weird like you could obviously make it to the restroom if you had to go to the bathroom you obviously would make it if your child went potty five minutes after that you would take your child all the way into the restroom and you would change his diaper be weird if you threw them down and we're like poop somebody hand me somebody hand me the wet wipes they got we gotta poop we got a situation we had a spill in aisle eight no you would make it to the restroom and you would change him because that is Decent Behavior so just because everything is normal every bodily function we have is normal does not mean it is then therefore normal to do it in public you know why because we're a civilization so I'd like to normalize civilization how about that yeah that's all I'm gonna say about that if you have a coffee

trending yesterday on Twitter over something that felt so innocuous the time when I shared it I was working on this episode I was interested in I have been interested in the psychological immune system of women and men and the online world and social media and I specifically wanted to lean in to women that are getting lot of work done obviously the people getting worked on has exploded over the years and it was not so popular 20 years ago now it's very popular I have tons of friends who get work done I do not hate on women getting worked on whatsoever but I was curious as to whether or not women that get work done we're getting it done for men so obviously I thought a good question a good starting place for this investigation would be me asking men if they think that women that get work done if it's appealing to them if they find it attractive and so I wrote serious question for men do you think that Botox filler fake lips look is attractive do you envision long-term relationship with those girls that look that way male opinions only please working on a show about social media mutating our appetites male opinions only please haha that was a sick joke women came in instantly and angrily they were like no no no no no this question is too big this question needs to be more specific Katniss men don't even know when we get a little bit of Botox they don't even know what they like like you need to be more because if a woman gets a little bit of Botox they can't even tell it's just a little maintenance and the thing is I think men understood the assignment because they all came back and said they didn't like it I mean I am talking 99.98 of men in the comments both on Instagram and on Twitter said no we don't like it women just could not accept or believe that answer it was just really bizarre watching how angry women were getting in the comments trying to justify having this work done they were going well you go look at the the follows of those men they all follow these girls that look like porn stars okay fair commentary back but why don't we just believe men when they're telling you that they don't like the overdone look and I think some men clarified yes you know I assume that these girls have low self-esteem that they're trashy and that they could be good for a hookup right but I don't want to make her my wife which means they understood the assignment that I was asking them because I just wanted to know if they're into that look and usually typically women will say my husband says I don't need it my husband says he doesn't like it and these other women that were for some reason answering this question even though I only asked men were basically arguing that will they prefer women that look younger but men were saying we don't actually think you look younger right they said actually I think it ages a woman that when I see a woman that gets a ton of work done my immediate mindset is okay she must be at least 40 and trying to hang on to her youth because it doesn't look natural and then women came back and said oh well you wouldn't even it's just like the makeup argument men think most women are natural with their makeup they still have a little bit of makeup on okay well that still proves if they only like women that have a little bit of makeup on enough to fool them that they prefer natural looking women to women that are all the way done up so I think men are being consistent here and telling you that they prefer natural beauty and what was weird about the women getting angry is that this would have been a good time to say thank you men right thank you for saying that I look beautiful without make makeup and without a bunch of work done because now I know that I don't have to spend this much money on work done but instead women were sort of imploding and were very angry at men but so the end of this I'll read you a few of the guys comments here huge turn off Botox and lip fillers can take an already gorgeous woman and suddenly make them significantly less attractive with only that small change natural is definitely 10 times more attractive and preferred another man writes no never to the question of do they like it I don't know why this is even a thing a woman wrote woman don't get toxins and fillers for men they do it for who judges them most which is other women don't believe or read any thread on Reddit and see how women break other women down by speaking of their hair nail skin routines and even how they parent I believe that is true I do believe that women do it for other women which I wanted to investigate and I believe that women do it because of other women beating them down or because women as I said earlier have a weaker psychological immune system when it comes to the online world I think women are more responsive to things that are trending on the internet women spend more time on Instagram I think women spend more time you know following Keeping Up with the Kardashians and watching The Real Housewives and seeing women that have all this work done and then they somehow view it as aspirational they see it as a form of luxury and that these women look better somehow but the men when they weigh in on this across the board said no we actually think that given a picture when you show me a girl before she said work done after I prefer her when she looks natural maybe just believe that that is what men believe another person man writes no no and no another guy writes like shoes and nails they don't do it for men but for the competition between other women another man writes they all look alike when they do it they look like they are all cousins another guy writes no it looks fake and bad I love a more natural look all day long again these were all of the comments they were consistent so I am still working on the episode where I would like to talk about women's psychological immune system and why women even when they are told you are beautiful by a man just the way you are still do not accept that what does making women believe that men just are lying online and that they just don't know that they're tricking them with botox but there's probably a lot more to unpack and we're not going to get to it today all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now thank you", "KzHmA7o8Uqk": "all right guys before we even get started I think I need to address some of the comments that I received yesterday regarding me covering an actual story that took place with Trump obviously I said that he was pretty rude to me and I was wondering whether or not constantly fighting was getting to him totally fair question Fair assessment never said I'm jumping off the Trump boat I hate Trump trump is awful despite me being totally reasonable in this assessment of course there are people who were vicious about it how dare you oh Candace the daily wires getting to you oh you're about to become a never Trumper like Ben Shapiro oh it's very obvious there's some coordinated attack oh my gosh cash is becoming a rhino yeah you guys are being a little dramatic honestly let's just take it down a couple of notches first and foremost obviously I can never be a part of the never Trump campaign because I have been one of his most vocal supporters but also I'm a responsible supporter meaning that it is crucial if we want to win the election in 2024 that we have an honest discussion about the conversations that are taking place on the ground people that were Avid supporters of trump are we getting to break with him it's not a coordinate native media attack I also had people that were saying no it's very obvious that she's about to be in the camp DeSantis absolutely not absolutely not I'm not saying never to SanDisk but I'm saying is I can only say that he is a good Governor I don't know if I agree with him and his foreign policy stances it's a way bigger conversation when you're talking about being president so when we have candidates that are legitimately running in 2024 I will assess them based on their merits not because the media is suddenly teamed DeSantis and kind of trying to say oh to Santa's is the next big thing and his wife's amazing all of that may be very true but I am not someone that goes to the crowd I have been very clear about that from the beginning I told you the truth about how I felt about Trump I think he's angry and he's starting to attack his allies and that is not a good thing it's not a good thing that he was angry with me when I spoke to him some of the comments also said well goodness did you pick up the phone and call Trump yes I spoke to him actually directly to his face during New Year's and he was mad at me and he said had I got in so much trouble for that interview that you did and it's like no you didn't get in trouble for the interview that I gave you got in trouble for what you said during the interview that's called taking personal responsibility I don't I think that he's going to have to Pivot and he's going to have to look like somebody that is not just angry and biting his allies that is me actually trying to help Trump right and obviously there were tons of comments of people who agreed so pay attention to those comments these are his actual supporters don't condemn them for asking questions and feeling differently if you want us to come together we all need to actually listen to one another okay saying that you are never Trump to me is a ridiculous statement it's never Trump no matter what he could be amazed never trump it is also a ridiculous and the opposite side of the same coin to say always and forever no matter what Trump even if he becomes a leftist and he supports uh you know uh pro-choice policies and even if he becomes even further onto the left and says that he loves Hillary Clinton and wants to run always and forever Trump no we all need to think critically right we are very close to losing our country and we need to make sure that we have the right leadership Trump for me was an amazing president as I said I was honored to be able to stand by his side I am honored that part of my platform is in due part because I spoke out about my support for Trump um but I think the reason that I have my platform today is because I'm committed to truth and I'm not committed to any narrative so I am not off of the Trump train I don't even know if there is a trump train he hasn't announced yet if he's running uh but I am going to allow myself to continue dedicating myself to the truth enough about that jumping in to the topic of the day the question of the day could you imagine a place where you could go to prison for questioning the mainstream media narrative you might be thinking that's a ridiculous question it's not it's a real place and that place is called Germany you're not even going to believe what they are attempting to get past as Law plus I'm going to be going over a recent episode of Emily ronajikowski's podcast the podcast is called high low and she had a conversation with Julia Fox we don't remember Julia Fox nobody knew who she was she dated Kanye for about two months after Kim Kardashian him split up and she kind of Hit the scene and in that conversation her and Emily talk about why they're buying her one-year-old son a baby doll and a tea set because they want to balance out his love of trucks I'm sorry what yep all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] so I asked you a question and I already gave you the answer to it this time I told you Germany it's a weird thing Americans don't travel enough or travel often actually the majority of Americans don't travel too much outside of their own state yet alone to another country and this is something that I'm grateful that I have the opportunity to do I'm grateful that I have I am well traveled it gives you a very good perspective on your own country right you start to really appreciate America when you leave America and realize that you don't have the same freedoms everywhere else you would assume that you go to Europe and Europe is something like America it's the Western sphere of course we must have all freedoms and that isn't actually the case freedom of speech the first amendment is unique it is incredibly unique they do not have it throughout the world and they certainly do not have it in Germany Germany has all sorts of enforcements against hate speech and one thing that I noticed and I don't even fully comprehend is that basically every time I tweet I get an email now from German Twitter I know it sounds weird but like German Twitter has an an enforcement program and I get these emails and like this is one example it says hello Twitter is required by German law to provide notice to users who are reported by people from Germany via the network Enforcement Act okay so I get reported Often by the people of Germany to the network because of the network Enforcement Act and then they always tell me what what I tweeted that deserved the report so this is the last time I received this is just a couple of days ago this is a tweet that was reported to the German Enforcement Act popo the Tweet was welcoming myself to elon's Twitter does this mean I am allowed to say that only women can give birth without having my account locked again our biological realities no longer considered hate speech may we meaningfully differentiate between mental disorders and Truth Ah that's okay in America not so much in Germany you cannot say these things in Germany we will report you and my account was reported and they informed me that my account was reported and by the way that is not the only thing that I have been reported for here's another tweet that I wrote that got reported I wrote tweet I mean quote president zielinski is a very bad character who is working with globalists against the interests of his own people I will not move one inch away from that assessment ever over no matter how flowery the media depictions of him are no you must not say that the network Enforcement Act says that you are reported for these words Candace Owens I hope my German accent's good I've got German friends are probably listening to this and are going to tell me it's not that great but yeah this is kind of a thing in Germany like they you do not have free speech and it's not just in Germany it's all across Europe you don't you can't just say whatever you want and so it's Unique To America that we do have it the reason I'm telling you this is because one of the laws that they have in place it is section 130 of the German penal code is regarding incitement to hatred and under this code you are prohibited from publicly denying the Holocaust and the penalty is three months to five years in prison so you can literally go to prison for this uh just giving you a recent example there was a woman she's 93 years old and she was sentenced to one year in prison for Holocaust Denial in April of this year now why am I telling you that well you might be thinking okay well that makes sense obviously it's Germany you're talking about the Holocaust they probably put these laws in place because of the extreme guilt that they have following World War II trying to make sure that they don't have an instance where crimes are allowed uh to happen again and so they kind of went very extreme and just said listen guys nothing we will accept nothing all that might make sense to you but the reason I'm telling you that is not to debate whether or not Germany should have free speech or whether or not this woman should be in prison uh the reason I'm telling you that is because they are attempting or I should say they attempted to add to section 130 of the German Penal Code okay so they're extremely anti-hate speech and these laws obviously are in sharp sharp contrast to our first amendment laws but what happened a couple of weeks ago was the German government quietly changed the scope of 130 to include a much broader definition of incitement to hatred which now encompasses for instance ready denying or questioning the Russian war crimes in Ukraine I'm sorry what what do you mean denying or questioning do you mean like me tweeting that president zielinski is a very bad character yeah that's what they mean they are quite literally trying to under the guise of the night say okay well this is bad we've already decided this is bad so why don't we just add to this Penal Code so that people are not allowed to question the mainstream media narrative regarding what is happening between Russia and Ukraine so they brought in the definition intentionally wanting to keep it vague on purpose because they wanted to create this environment of fear and uncertainty that would make you very scared to imagine you're a German citizen you see that they are trying to quietly extend this law right a law that obviously had some real meaning which is why I always say that the left does right they start with something that is substance like racism and sexism and then they start to say ah but it could kind of be anything racism could kind of be anything it's kind of in the eye of the beholder and that's what they're trying to do to this section 130. hate speech can really be anything hate speech could even be just questioning the narrative and of course you should always question the mainstream media narrative today because we know that they have lied to us so many times in the past imagine if they said it was hate speech to question the covid narrative imagine if they said it was an act of hate speech for you to question the safety of the coveted vaccines as I have done if I lived in Germany today they would be looking at me because I have said from the very beginning I am not pro-russia but I sure am not pro-ukraine government either we know that Ukraine has always been a laundromat it does not make sense to me that we have given them 50 billion dollars that is the amount that we gave throughout the entire Afghan war we've already given that to Ukraine very quickly right we're fighting a proxy war it's very clear and we are not going to know where those tax dollars went just like we don't know where those tax dollars went in Afghanistan we have no idea where they went in fact we ended up just giving all the Weaponry to the Taliban we did not win that war and they know that we are not going to win anything in the region of Ukraine and Russia they know that what is the purpose of this in my opinion money laundering again from the American people at a time when that money should be better spent at home now all these things are reasonable to say at least today I guess originally when the war broke out it wasn't okay people were angry at me how dare you question the mainstream media narrative but you would never even if you disagreed with everything that I just said suggested I should spend time in prison for not agreeing that president zielinski is just wonderful amazing person even though the Washington Post and the New York Times a couple of years ago spoke about the fact that he was way too involved with these Ukrainian oligarchs they spoke about the fact that he was basically funded he was an actor that was literally funded to become the president you were allowed to question to Lindsay couple of years ago but then the mainstream media changed their mind and now the German people are going to be beholden to the mainstream media narrative right that's what they were attempting at least to get past fortunately this change in legislation was opposed by both the right wing and the left-wing party and it need it would need to pass the upper chamber on November 25th but the direction is clear dissent is not going to be tolerated uh and they do not want people they're attempting to essentially weaponize the German legal system against people who question the official narrative and I just think that that I was so blown away by this it's so easy for us to Simply focus on what's going on at home but I was just so blown away that they would attend potentially do this even if it's happening in Germany because you're seeing more and more of this happening here right you're seeing more and more of them people saying that to question things is an act of terrorism we're seeing almost this overreaching definition of terrorism as it exists January 6 the Insurrection these people were domestic terrorists did you support Trump you're a domestic terrorist oh my gosh be so afraid God forbid you ask meaningful questions about January 6th as I have done as in are we still going to pretend that some guy dropped off pipe bombs the night before January 6th on January 5th and that our FBI still has no idea who that individual is smells to me like an inside job right oh how dare you say that Candace maybe you should spend a month in prison no maybe you should understand that when our government works in lockstep with the mainstream media problems are going to arise that is very scary and it is not right that is all I have to say about that okay guys I want to take a moment to talk to you about Black Rifle coffee this is my go-to coffee brand

voters are looking for a vision they're looking both left and right by the way we agree we do not like the direction that our country is headed toward it's not nice to go to a gas pump and realize that you're spending so much more money than you used to it's not nice to go pick up some groceries and see how expensive it is to Simply feed your family and who do we turn to to tell us that they have a vision well you would think the president of the United States Joseph Biden of course Joseph Biden please tell us what you're going to do differently maybe you're watching this and you're going I voted for you and you know what I I kept it and I voted blue for the midterms all the way down the line because I believe that even though this is not the greatest country at this moment right even though what's happening right now isn't so great rather that's a better way to state that I do believe that Joe Biden can fix this and so a reporter came to him came to this great President Joe Biden asked him what he would do differently and here's what Joe Biden had to say what in the next two years do you intend to do differently uh to change people's uh opinion of the direction of the country particularly as you contemplate a run for president in 2024. nothing oh nothing okay well uh that's remarkably honest of you Mr President I uh you know I I think I appreciate the honesty I didn't we weren't thought you were doing anything you haven't done anything I've even run for president really you hid behind a screen the entire time you had some cars talking at you at random moments and you got interviewed by cardi B you didn't really do anything to even deserve to live in the White House but uh okay I guess I'm sticking with you but let's get a little more specific let's ask him another question obviously a lot of attention on 2024 now that the votes have been cast in the midterms two-thirds of Americans in exit polls say that they don't think you should run for reelection what is your message to them and how does that factor into your final decision about whether or not to run for re-election it doesn't watch me [Laughter] nothing you say factors into anything don't care just watch me dude can't touch this I mean you know what I I used to get so angry and frustrated but I'm just learning to laugh at this I'm learning to laugh because it is the only way to get through it I mean he doesn't care he's made it abundantly clear he doesn't care if you're suffering he doesn't care if you don't like him he doesn't care if you don't think he's the right man to run 2024 your opinion means nothing to your president okay because it doesn't matter at the end of the day and I think as midterms have shown uh people are going to vote down party lines they don't even care about how much they're suffering they're just gonna boat down party lines they don't even want change they just want to say I feel like a good person because I'm still voting Democrat so who are we to say anything to them there's your president guys he ain't doing nothing moving on I saw this story on Twitter lives of tick tock you know that account phenomenal account and incredible they used to get banned all the time for quite literally just sharing videos of what was happening on Tick Tock um and they've really kind of leaned into wanting parents to understand how aggressive the pornography that is happening in school is as well as this transgenderism which I think is very closely uh very close to the topic of transgenderism is a topic of pornography I think a lot of it is trying to Prime people trying to Prime children for abuse I believe that for sexual abuse it's very strange to me that there's suddenly this hyper focus on children's genitals and their sexual desires it's not right it's strange and you don't you should not allow the media to Gaslight you to believe it's not strange that you're just not woke enough for understanding enough so lives of tick tock recently spoke to a father who confronted his daughter's principal in Oklahoma in the Owasso Oklahoma Public School System about a pornographic book entitled blankets which depicts sex masturbation and a child getting raped you would think good for this father that's absolutely what you should do you should be storming into the schools and you should be saying what is this is unacceptable what are the principal do the principle responded by calling the police and banning the father from school grounds yup that is true the father told lit to tick tock that when he asks the principal if she thought that the content in blankets in blankets was okay for children she replied I'm offended by your questions how dare you even ask the question dad and now he is not allowed to pick up his kids without written permission in fact they even issued a letter to him now so angry that they could even asked the question about the pornographic material they wrote him this letter in the letter reads in light of your actions that took place on the grounds of the district on the evening of October 10 2022. after the board meeting it has been determined that you have committed one or more acts that interfere with the peaceful conduct of activities on District property and your presence interferes with the peaceful conduct of activities on District property therefore pursuant two there's a code in the law you are hereby directed to leave the Owasso Public Schools and all of its grounds including sports venues and not return this prohibition also includes any District activity or field trip not conducted on school property as I have determined that your presence is a threat to the peaceful conduct of students should you fail to leave the school grounds immediately or should you return within six months without first obtaining my written permission to do so the school district will have no alternative but to take such legal action as is necessary to maintain a peaceful educational and work environment as per board policy 1.24 a request for consideration may be filed by you so long as it is received by the district within five calendar days of your receipt of this letter sincerely Dr Margaret Coates the superintendent of schools who is a freak absolute freak to allow this graphic book to be something that is attributed to children and the idea that you're going to bully talking about the state just saying actually these are our kids now you're going to bully him you're going to say now you're not even a lot of student grounds because we're not Predators for showing this sexual material which depicts child rate you're a predator for asking why we are showing this material so I'm going to State this again I've stated this many times to parents and I hope that if I saved enough time other parents will start saying it and we'll kind of catch on here Distributing pornographic material to minors is a crime you actually don't have to March into the school you should be marching into your local police station you should be saying let me tell you superintendent what the code is under the laws okay the actual laws in this city the actual federal laws that we have in this nation okay let me show you what codes and what laws you violated and tell you that actually if no action is taken I am going to file a complaint with police officers we need to start having teachers and we need to start having superintendents that are Distributing this sort of pornographic material to minors arrested until these individuals are arrested there is not going to be a strong enough signal sent to the school system to tell them that we are not going to tolerate this Behavior we should never tolerate this behavior and that is what I believe is going to be the action that will make that incredibly clear to them all right so it's no secret that inflation continues to be a plague on our economy our families and our savings and irresponsible Democrat spending continues to

internet because something something something feminism something something something something the patriarchy it's sexism it's classic misogyny it's always a classic sexism and classic misogyny no matter what if you have an opinion that is not in line with her as well good news guys Emily rochkowski has launched a podcast okay I'm saying launch maybe she always had one I wouldn't know but her podcast is called is called high low and recently she had a conversation with Julia Fox Julia Fox I actually all I know is that she is a mother who dated Kanye for like two weeks is trying to spin this into a career and Emily has hosted her because I don't know she is all about being sexy and naked and girl power or something and they recently discussed their one-year-olds um or their children rather Emily discussed her one-year-old he is a boy and here is what these two ladies had to share with one another my morning routine I like bring science I make him breakfast whatever and then I get in the shower inside comes with me and then when I get dressed and like do my makeup he's just chilling playing around me so now he does it he'll put on my clothes he'll play with the makeup yeah it's so crazy Sly like loves trucks and oh my God Valentino love strong okay well they need another reason freaks out freaks out he stops everything he's doing he's like whoa whoa Sly literally is like oh oh oh it's like so excited loves to play with things with the wheels and I'm like I I'm not kidding this morning I ordered him a baby doll and a tea set because I'm like we gotta like bounce out but also like is this just what he likes well naturally he loves pushing around a little stroller with a doll in it okay yeah yeah yeah and and I bought him a pink truck oh so I have a pink convertible thing okay yeah so yeah you know I don't know I'm like are those the little ways that you can start to help with the like making sure that the conditioning doesn't happen so yeah yeah so essentially they're diagnosing their little boys with being little boys I know they just love trucks they just every time he just actually naturally likes trucks because he is a biological male and I have a one-year-old also and he loves drugs never because we conditioned him to do anything right he just eats a truck and just like she's describing he goes oh wow every time he sees one and every time we're driving and he sees one he stops and makes a big face because I have a little boy right and there are differences biological differences between boys and girls that is just the truth women are born little girls when they grow up they want to have Barbie dolls so what she's essentially saying is there's something wrong with my little boy because he's acting like a little boy and so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to diagnose that as being I don't know incorrect something's wrong with that and I'm going to Instead try to condition him to act like a little girl and so she's going to buy a baby doll and she's going to say okay it's enough when playing with the truck play with the doll okay it's enough I see that you're really drawn to that naturally here is a pink truck he's just you should like pink because you're a boy or something I mean you just need to I just need to get this out of you this boy thing you're doing I mean this is what I'm talking about when I say that crazy parents create crazy children right Emily rajkowski is crazy I know that she's getting a divorce and I hope that her husband her former husband I guess like current husband is listening to this podcast and recognizing that this is what your son is going to be around someone that thinks that there's something wrong with him for being a boy right like she actually thinks that's something that she needs to try to fix because he's presenting symptoms of being a biological male absolutely and pointedly ridiculous and really allows you to see behind the curtain in terms of what we're talking about when we say that people in Hollywood are demented right it's constantly about virtue signaling right they need to Virtue they need to Signal it they have virtue and they can do this by destroying their children that's what she's doing and it's trash in my opinion moving on to Hollywood have you guys ever seen the Saw movies doesn't matter if you've seen the movies you know what I'm talking about when I see the Saw movies have you at least seen a poster for the Saw horror flicks maybe like guy on the front of the poster his name's jigsaw here he is right here if you haven't seen a picture of him well Madonna looks just like this now I just I was pointing out that Madonna looks exactly like jigsaw and she is not on a murdering spree and B at all but I think she's definitely crazy I've said this multiple times and let's just jump right into Madonna's recent Tick Tock where she's uh twerking in lingerie take a look so she's got her boobs out as usual she's wearing a ton of chains she's got log King tails and she's um sticking her big big booty she recently got that yeah six-year-old woman getting fake Kardashian implants in her butt she's tickle enough and she's wearing fishnets and she's popping she's popping popping popping why because for whatever reason nobody wants to get her the help that she needs and the love that she needs to stop doing this again I laugh at Madonna but deep down I feel sad for her I think this is what happens when you are not surrounded by stability this is what happens when adults do not tell you no because you're rich so why should I tell you no you're paying me so I'm just going to keep telling me that everything that you're doing is amazing when in fact I should be telling you to stop I should be telling you that you are almost 65 years old and that that doesn't mean that you're not free to act elegantly and to act respectfully that's what we are trying to encourage in this Society but unfortunately kids have Tick Tock and they get to observe this breakdown actually maybe we'll have the opposite desired effect maybe people will look at it as I do and say man when I ever get to that age I want to make sure that I am

like Brett Cooper you guys know I'd like to read your comments and apparently some of you guys are really focused on my appearance and not in a nice way you guys be hating is what I'm trying to say first comment you guys know that I wore the red dress on Election Day because I was like if I wear red it'll be good vibes it was a long sleeve red dress that quite literally went down to my ankle so that did not matter to this commenter who goes under out of the box seven that's his handle he writes you are married what kind of sensual dress is that I am starting to see a different Candace than the one that I had in mind you keep giving leverage to Demons they will destroy your marriage repent sincerely uh I really want to say that I would like to repent I would sincerely like to repent I did not realize that my dress which was down to my ankles and long sleeves was too sensual and that it was leveraging demons I do know that the color red is associated with Satan so maybe that's what you mean this feels a little bit games of thronesy Shame Shame Shame to me you know I consider myself to be very conservative and I really cover up but I'm realizing that I have to get to another level I have got to cover up more and I hear you and that is why I am like whoa head to toe today I'm not playing no games with this you are right next person and of course this person is Asian and I'm going to tell you why this person is Asian she's commenting on my eyebrows and this has been a long thing in my life that Asian women always got something to say about my eyebrows her name is Cho Newen it might be win I can't Nguyen and Cho says the inner corner of your left eyebrow is often lower and it's very noticeable oh well maybe it's just me if I'm your makeup artist I will leave the gap between two eyebrows a little bigger beautiful lady beautiful soul that is just my experience this is why I love Asians they just tell you things and they insult you and you just take it it's like and honestly that's in my experience because a woman named Sue used to do my eyebrows for years when I lived in New York and every time I went to sue she insulted me to my face she told me actually that she wished that my mother had shaved my eyebrows and started over but because she's Asian she got away with it like I don't know it just we keep going back and we get abused and that is I'm going to take this abuse ciao I'm gonna take this abuse from you and I hope that you keep abusing me um and I will deliver the message to my makeup artist and I will shave my eyebrows and I will start over next comment is from Billy Mitchell it is regarding my trump monologue Billy Mitchell writes no human including Trump deserves to be put on a pedestal I voted for Trump twice but I also could not understand why he folded declared an emergency and pushed the vaccine I lost a lot of respect for him Kenneth has every right to voice her opinion I remember that she was the first and only one in the beginning of code to say that it was baloney Brave and honest woman to call him out on it proud of you don't back down thank you Billy for saying that that means a lot because it is people have a very short memory and they forget that even when Trump didn't have your back during the lockdowns I did and I always just call things right and wrong as I see it and I follow the truth I don't follow people and I was very upset with him with a lot of stuff they did during covid and again I still have extended Grace to realize that none of us could imagine the weight of that what it's like to be the president what is like to be the leader of the Free World and everyone's telling you that there's going to be this Mass plague and there's remember at the time they were saying there was going to be not enough space in hospitals and people were going to be on the street trying to get treatment that they really tried to present this as if uh this was going to be the Bubonic plague and it was not that but even with that pressure I think that if I was President United States I would have never folded because I believe that people have a right to Freedom you give them the information you allow them to live the way that they want so thank you for understanding that I too have a right to criticize any person that I want the next question I mean the next comment rather is should you is regarding my monologue that I did about whether or not we should leave our money to kids we should we make a bunch of money should we leave an inheritance to our kids or is it more important for them to learn how to work by themselves and not to have that cushion in the back of their minds this person uh the handle is daring greatly 84 says if you don't let your kids stand on your shoulders you're putting them at a huge disadvantage What You Won't Do for your kids someone else is doing for theirs it's biblical to leave an inheritance for your children who else are you going to give it to a charity where one person may take it all let's face it most of us aren't leaving behind the type of wealth celebrities leaving behind so what you're leaving will be enough to make life a little easier for your family line probably not a lifestyle change I agree with that I think that's a fair assessment I was bringing into I was just calling into question the fact that I do think that hard work does determine somebody and I do think that knowing that you don't have to work as hard actually disadvantage your children so if you're talking about will they be disadvantaged they have nothing yes but they also will be disadvantaged they have everything people need to Aspire they need to be inspired and I think that people that have their backs against the wall fight harder float a bit I think I'm an example of that but you're right it's nice to leave your children something my question is a little bit more nuanced how much I guess is too much all right guys next portion of the show is

get in the weeds you go actually to san francisco which is really the capital of american communism how did you get into this sport of deciding that you were i call it a sports that's the that's a euphemism really but it's like going down and actually getting your hands into this sort of journalism well i mean i come from the radical left i was a very radical young kid i went to nicaragua to help the san anistas in 1988. i've always been committed to social justice i remain committed to social justice even though i my politics are much more moderate right now but yeah i mean i've always done investigative reporting i've been in war zones all around the world nicaragua honduras guatemala the congo and san francisco right now is as dangerous as any war zone i've been in large parts of downtown are controlled by a foreign drug cartel they've opened a supervised drug use site where people smoke meth and fentanyl under the watchful gaze of city contractors so i am outraged by what's happening i think it's absolutely an abomination on our civilization on our society i think it's a national shame and embarrassment and i'm committed to exposing it and the only way what i do is i just go talk to people i hold up my iphone and interview them and it's shocking how few reporters are doing that right now interesting to say to use the phrase social justice because it's come to mean a lot of different things to me it's some instantly a negative connotation that signals to me governments are you know doing a lot of stuff behind closed doors but they're signaling to the american population that what they're doing is good look over here sort of is what i hear when i hear social justice a social justice pursuit um and i think that you said that i still love social justice has it taken on a new meaning for you it has and i think the way i'm using the term might be different than the way many progressives use it in san francisco you remember we're spending about a hundred thousand dollars per homeless person in san francisco it's insane and we had a 16 year old girl die from a drug overdose just a couple of days ago i interviewed two people that had been raped on the streets it is absolute barbarism these are open drug scenes that we euphemistically refer to as homeless encampments everybody out there is addicted to drugs suffering from some mental illness nobody that can't afford the rent just goes and camps out in the most dangerous and dirty sidewalks in the world so for me social justice means really two things and i can't i don't know what's left or right when it comes to these issues we need law and order we also need universal psychiatric and addiction care because people that have schizophrenia or addicted to heroin or fentanyl or meth aren't out there shopping for insurance providers they need the care the time to give it to them is after they overdose on drugs but we basically just need to start enforcing our laws because that's often how you get people that are suffering from mental illness or drug addiction the help that they need inflation is out of control and we see that more than ever in the grocery store prices keep hitting new all-time highs for meat and seafood cooking and grilling at home used to be the way to save money but with prices up nearly 20 even that seems like a thing of the past if you're looking to save money

your 30 savings order now to combat inflation with good ranchers american meat delivered when i hear the term social justice to me it most nearly means it is the government having an excuse to extract a lot of wealth from ordinary americans claiming that they're putting it toward an issue that seems to always worsen the more money that they extract and some interesting statistics that you know i've learned from you california has spent at least 13 billion dollars on homelessness between 2018 and 2020. i mean that's that's literally that's two years 13 billion and i wouldn't say the issue has gotten any better between 2015 and 2018 another statistic from your book san francisco replaced more than 300 lamp posts corroded by urine after one had collapsed and crushed a car a lot of money again to be taking from hardworking american taxpayers to have this be the result i want to start by just watching a clip so that the audience better understands the work that you do because it's really incredible sure cause karen did body on the bus somebody was carrying a dead body on the bus yeah oh my god he was trying to get him to the hospital but he was clearly dead and stiff as hell ah fentanyl had to be how about this dude right here what's your name brandon drug of choice not a fentanyl all right how much what are you doing right now um okay did you get any help from the city uh yeah and what kind of help my mom started to help for a couple minutes be safe dude okay you know the brandon here yeah he seems like he's struggling incoherent people going super crazy off like meth and stuff and like running down the street [\u00a0__\u00a0] naked how long have you been in san francisco like six months i prefer uh fentanyl but every now and then uh i'll mix it with like some methamphetamines how did you get started when i was like 14 years old um just ran into like uh some emotions i didn't know how to handle and i decided to give it a try where are you from houston texas i got one of those nummy things hey check this out look yeah ow when fentanyl first came out here i think it was ancient medicine bowl stuff that the government had put something in it i don't know but they had it was the size of a pin drop literally this big this big sir when dragons fly they sweat right right i watched all my friends growing up i watched them they just passed away from here i'm the one that accidentally stole a police car they made me steal it maybe jump in it and like then their eyes were like done it's the city of the city no more man it's it's it's this this is came to yeah it's all for them everything when i first came here this was unbelievable place they said i left my heart in san francisco yeah really real 13 billion dollars in two years in california does the government want to help these people they say they do but they're in the grip of victim ideology and victim ideology is this idea that you can divide people into victims and oppressors and to victims everything should be given and nothing required but that's a death sentence if you're suffering from serious drug addiction that's why we have four times higher drug overdose deaths in san francisco than the national average it's why people are being raped on the street it's why i mean including kids are being sucked into it so it's a crazy ideology i wrote san francisco in part to just expose it because i think once people realize what's happening i think ordinary folks left right and center will all see it for being as sinister as it really is thanks for joining me on this segment

is should children have jobs for a second plus we're going to be covering a scary new AI technology that you need to know about and some breaking news regarding the Pfizer vaccine hint you were lied to by the government could you imagine that all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] thank you in case you didn't know there is so much uncertainty that comes with buying me at the grocery

codecandis at checkout to claim your special Oktoberfest offer so I'm going to give you a little background on how I came up with the question of the day but I have to preface this with telling you how much PTSD I had doing this monologue and this topic and this question because it was inspired by my visit uh to I think honestly the best pizza that I've ever had in Nashville which is called Manny's Pizza now why did I have PTSD because I promise you the strangest Firestorm that I've ever existed in was when last year you will recall I went to New York City and I interviewed Eric trump it looks great that day by the way looked so great and I wanted to make sure that I took some photos of myself this was during covid not the lockdowns but New York City was requiring that you had a vaccine passport so you were unable to go into stores and buy anything unless you had the vaccine of course I did not get the coveted vaccine I've been very open about that and I still wanted to have New York Pizza I'm from New York and the pizza down south is just not as good everybody knows that and so we had orchestrated a manner to somehow get the pizza and I took a picture of it of me eating the pizza because I thought this is so great look no vaccine and I have a slice of New York Pizza and I was shocked when a bunch of people commented throwing me into pizzagate like they actually thought that me eating a slice of pizza in New York correlated to me being a part of some John podesta ring and the people that were the most sensible in the comments I'm not even kidding they were so angry that I posted a picture of me eating pizza and the more senseful people said you know what I don't think Kansas has anything to do with John podesta but it's irresponsible for her to talk about or eat pizza publicly she knows how some of us feel about pizza guys let me tell you I love myself a good conspiracy theory but you are going to have to be able to think a little more clearly than believing that John podesta's emails yes they were freaking weird I can totally say that I have no idea what they amount to but they were completely weird and and I had a lot of questions about them but to then not be able to differentiate between a person who just wants to eat a slice of pizza you gotta you know you gotta maybe take off a tin foil hatch just a little bit so anyways yesterday I went and went to Manny's Pizza in Nashville because my assistant has heard me gripe about this that there just is no good Italian food full stop I would say in Nashville it just is lacking but the whole culture of just grabbing a slice doesn't really exist here and she kept telling me over and over again there was just one place she had to bring me to that was in the arcade which is an area here in Nashville and I went and it lived up to the hype it was amazing it was this adorable family they are from Sicily they've been running and operating that for the last 30 years and they are originally from Brooklyn New York I mean they immigrated they emigrated from Sicily and they came from New York down to Nashville and established this pizza place and it was fantastic and so I posted a picture even though I was scared to do it but in talking to this family and hearing their history and they were talking about how much they loved Nashville and just how they got to this moment where they're now being hailed as the best pizza place in Nashville he told me that he actually learned uh the owner this is he told me that he actually learned how to make pizza because his first job when he lived here was when he was 12 years old and he used to deliver pizzas in New York City and he sort of described riding this bicycle and holding pizza at the same time trying to figure out like this is this was his job and the image for whatever reason made me nostalgic in a way it made me think about my brother's first job which he must have been about 12 years old as well and his job was to deliver paper so I started thinking about paper boys and people that deliver pizza and I just thought of these young children that used to have jobs like jobs that were substant having to wake up and commit to something that bore responsibility that ingrained responsibility in them and then of course it made me think about my grandfather you guys know I always talk about him but just I'm just amazed that he lived in a time where at the age of five he was working five years old North Carolina having to wake up in the morning and lay tobacco out to drive having to do real farm work and I thought about these individuals I thought about my grandfather I thought about my brother I thought about this Sicilian now living in Nashville Tennessee and owning being a small business owner a successful small business owner and I craved an older time in this country where we had values and I started asking myself why don't children work anymore now I know you're interested thinking of Candice because I don't know it's a form of Slavery to have children work children should just be able to enjoy their childhood but there is something about working that establishes a better human being we are not creating better human beings anymore or quality human beings anymore do you know what I mean like it just seems that everyone is so entitled to everything I shared with you many episodes ago the story about the assistant that I had 22 years old is how old he was asking to make a hundred and thirty five thousand dollars a year after a month of work why because he's entitled because he doesn't even act actually know what real work is you have children that grow up to become the adults like they're facing right now at Goldman Sachs that say we're being abused yes we make I don't know almost a hundred thousand dollars a year and we are but we're working long hours and we shouldn't have to work long hours I was talking about this with my husband last night it's just thinking we need to teach children these values in some way and is it really that bad for children I'm talking about from 12 to 15 years old to have work you know to to understand where money comes from is that really such a a far away concept would we produce more well-rounded human beings and we started talking about uh the economy right the various economies that we have operating first and foremost the primary economy being the agricultural economy people that work on farms the secondary economy that we moved toward being the industrial economy think about factories think about China think about China being a place that is driven by a primarily industrial economy and yet when we look at the Asian Americans that are here what is the result of that they they tend to work harder than most Americans they're they're harder workers and maybe it has to do with the fact that they're operating primarily under the industrial economy but of course today we've landed into this tertiary economy which is largely Services insurance companies banking services financial services Health Care Services it's a largely digital economy that is producing the human beings that I'm talking about who feel so entitled because they're sitting behind a desk all day and they really think that they're just working so hard but these people don't have what it takes of course to work on farms and and they look down at people and I started exploring just the history of the labor laws in this country and when we decided that it was no longer appropriate for children to have jobs and by the way this is not an argument that we should be having children working in factories and getting burned and getting hurt and almost human slave-like like what we see in China but just in general having a job having some form of a responsibility and it brought me back to the Reagan Era initiatives now of course there were a lot of steps that happened in government before this so I'm giving you the shorter version here but during the Reagan Era the labor secretary Raymond Donovan proposed that existing child labor policy be updated the administration's plan would have opened more opportunities for employment for children aged 14 and 15 years of age it would have also extended the number of hours per day and per week that children might be employed and it would have revised standards for the employment of child workers and jobs that were once considered to be too hazardous so they the child labor laws basically said you know this was the standards Act of 1938 also known as child labor laws they were enacted to ensure that when young people work the work is safe and does not jeopardize their health their well-being or their educational opportunities and I want to say I do of course think that in any capacity where children are working not just children by the way adults that the circumstances are not so hazardous that they might die right but that last one is interesting that the fla flsa standards want to make sure that it doesn't jeopardize their education educational opportunities so anyways when they propose this obviously there was a lot of criticisms and the criticisms that came actually generated a bunch of protests from educational groups and labor unions who expressed outrage over what they described to be a scheme to enable restaurant chores to exploit school-age workers right so there was backlash that was coming from educational groups and I find that to be very interesting I find it interesting that the law is that the idea here is that we want to make sure children have educational opportunities but what's the result of that the result of that is that we now have children that are not working we have now have children that have no idea what entrepreneurism is we now have children that think and have been conditioned to think because of these protests winning in the end by the way in the end the Reagan proposals did not go through they conceded and let them go because of these protests but we now have children that think that there is a safety and a cushion in just going to school and learning and learning what by the way my answer would be nothing as I've said before you now have circumstances in inner cities where they can't find a single child that is proficient in reading and writing and math that's in inner cities like Baltimore the education system is actually systematically dumbing children down so they're not learning how to start companies they're learning a bunch of fluff they're learning Marxist ideologies in fact what they're learning is how to become dependent on the government these people eventually become uh proponents of welfarism right the government should just give me handouts because I don't know how to do anything so we removed again power from the individual power from the households that importance of the values that are instilled in children when they learn how to do things like I don't know hand out newspapers I know that that's not a thing anymore people barely read newspapers but what the vow the values that are taught when you have a job like that right we remove those values away from them and they said don't worry just go to school we don't we don't want you to be exploited in the workforce we want to exploit you in a classroom because that's what's happening we're exploiting children in classrooms we're exploiting them to nonsense we're exploiting them to bad information we're exploiting them to a zero skill sets right zero skill sets is what they're learning in the classroom they're just learning that hey but you got a degree and therefore you should feel pompous you should walk out with your head held high because you have this degree in gender studies and you're going to be you're going to do something one day what that something is we don't know probably what's going to happen is you're just going to be able to become a professor because when you learn what the free markets are which is not going to be in this classroom you're going to realize that nobody calls a gender Studies major when something goes wrong at their house and there's a fire you don't call a gender Studies major when you're being robbed you don't call a gender Studies major when you need to have your air conditioning fixed in the heat you don't call a gender Studies major you don't care about whether or not a person has a degree no they wake up and they realize that what they really have been exploited by is the education system and they can no longer become productive human beings in society and what does that turn into angry human beings you're angry because you did exactly what you were told you were told that it was glorious for you to apply to a bunch of colleges get into the best one maintain your GPA have your parents humble brag on Facebook up dropping him off today at the University of so-and-so so so excited bye bye waving him off spent four years getting yourself into debts received a meaningless degree only to discover that nobody nobody wants to hire you you don't actually know anything you don't have any skills and those people who have a more traditional understanding about work and what values are in this Society those people that maybe didn't go to college at all but do know how to fix an AC are making more money than you so you're angry and the best way to channel that anger is through meaningless protests so maybe you you joined the women's March the women's March it's about misogyny maybe you joined the black lives matter campaign it's because you know why I suck and I'm not getting a job it's because I'm black or it's because I'm a woman you know you joined the ism game you you try to rinse off the anger that you have through meaninglessness so yeah I don't know um exactly the policy that needs to be written or how we would make it make sense to people that it is good for children I'm talking older children 14 15 years old to have jobs but I do believe that the answer is yes they should have responsibilities that should be instilled in them when they're young and that's all I have to say about that okay guys I want to talk to you about front page magazine founded by conservative writer David Horowitz front page magazine has spent over two decades combating the radical left's efforts to destroy America there are two new podcasts the right tape with Mark Thompson and the Jason Hill show offer riveting interviews and insightful coverage of politics culture and current events it takes a village to combat the radical left's efforts to destroy America that's why as a fan of my show you should also check out these guys over at front page magazine by visiting frontpagemag.com and while you're there you can support their cause by making a tax deductible donation inside every Progressive is a totalitarian screaming to get out and no one understands that better than the team over at front page magazine so go to frontpagemag.com today okay now it's time for some topics to show foreign [Music] first up have you guys watched the series on Netflix called Black Mirror if you have not you definitely should I actually think it's a very important series it's incredibly compelling and essentially it explores the way that technology is invading into our lives and these are not things that are actually happening there are scenarios that could be happening and I think now when you explore the series you realize that they are happening it's almost like the series was supposed to be futuristic and now it seems to be in the moment when I read the news I go oh that's another episode of Black Mirror Black Mirror by the way it has that title because of the Black Mirror of our TVs of our cell phones when they're turned off and this story is just really scary to me um the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has been brought back to life by artificial intelligence in an eerie fake interview 11 years after his death it's part of a new podcast series by podcast.ai to demonstrate how its AI Tech can be used the voice of the iPhone innovator can be heard for almost 20 minutes being interviewed by podcaster Joe Rogan whose voice was also digitally replicated so to be clear uh this conversation of course never took place but they are using artificial intelligence to make it seem as if it did they're being open this is just AI now the first couple of minutes of this which I'm going to play for you you can definitely tell it's robotic right it's it they especially Steve Jobs I think Joe Rogan actually sounds a real person but Steve Jobs uh does not sell it does sound a bit like a robot in the beginning but as it goes on and you should pursue the Phil podcast to see how scary it is it you can't tell it just sounds like two individuals talking so here are the first couple of minutes of that conversation take a listen so without further Ado my friend who's difficult to describe and wonderful and I'm so grateful he came on the show how's it going good to see you buddy it's been a long time since I've been on the show I've missed this it's always fun how's it going come on tell me about jobs [Laughter] it's always good to see you buddy I'm so happy you came on man yeah it's great to be on the show your audience is just so different from your normal Apple users and that's a good thing it's cool well you know I was an Apple user way before I did this show I've been a fan of yours at MacIntosh since the 1980s well you know we just kind of figured that out even though apple is Big it's still like half a percent of the total users people who listen to your show are a different group they're weird well that's good so you must be a fan of the show then right I am I am a fan I mean it's nice to sit back in the car and listen to you ran I've always liked you well uh appreciate that and we have some weird tie which hooks into the fact that I was a big fan of Gizmodo and I still go there all the time but then there was some controversy or something well you know we always thought it was very funny we were as surprised to see that stuff as you guys were to see it on Gizmodo it's kind of a game to us I got you man that's cool so let me tell you why this should terrify you so we know already of course that and we talked about this yesterday on the show that consumer technology is obviously behind government technology people say it's about 20 years behind we talked yesterday on the show about Concord the sonic boom Jets right that could get you across the Atlantic in just two and a half hours and of course that doesn't exist anymore we now have you know Boeing 787 and it'll get you there in about six hours six to seven hours if you're flying from London to New York but of course the sonic boom technology the government still has it and of course the planes and the Jets that they're flying the military are flying are nothing like what we have of available to Consumers that just makes sense the reason why this kind of sent to chill down my spine is I remember the big conspiracy theory back when I was a child surrounding 911. and it was a bunch of people who had lost loved ones on the plane now maybe they were saying this because they were grief stricken I'm not trying to add Credence to these claims but the individuals who received those phone calls those last phone calls that were saying oh there's a hijacker on the plane some of them said that wasn't my loved one who called me that was a fake voice that I was listening to it wasn't my loved one right and this sort of fed the fuel that 911 was a big conspiracy theory and at the time that's unimaginable how could you have fake voices calling you from the skies well this now makes that an entire plausibility going into the future you can assume that government has better technology so it's not going to sound a little robotic as it does with these people that are experimenting on podcast.ai it's now entirely plausible that they could use all of the video and the audio that they have of Canada and speaking in her various podcasts every single day five days a week and they can make me pretend that I said something that I never said just by combining words together very quickly and making it sound hey we have this exclusive audio of Candace ranting you know and saying a bunch of homophobic racist uh and and horrible language that is entirely plausible and that should scare you I go back to Black Mirror and that series because there was an episode on the series where a couple one of the male was driving and he got into a very serious car accident and he died and his wife who was completely grief stricken realized that there was an availability in which they had could download and sort all of the audio voice messages that he had given her things that he had said on the internet and basically create fake conversations so she could still have him close to her she could still talk to him right so just being able to talk to this person because they've created this AI version of you based on everything that you've already said and so she would talk to this voice it wasn't really her husband but actually was her husband right because this is again audiophiles together to create an AI robot and then she takes this next extreme step after she feels comfortable and this is kind of helping her with her grief and she still feels like he's here and she's talking to him on the phone she takes this next step and she orders the robot version of him which is something that of course Could Happen down the line an audio version of someone that exists in a robot to make you feel like the person is still here so you don't ever really have to lose someone of course this is dystopian and it's dark and it's terrifying and that is why this seemingly light-hearted thing of course they're they're not doing this to be dark or to be nefarious they're just thinking how cool that AI can do this artificial intelligence can create a conversation 15 years after the fact that never took place they're not doing this because they're thinking about Black Mirror but you should be thinking about where this could potentially go I also think that it's got to be super weird for Steve Jobs wife to hear this conversation and going back to Black Mirror like she's hearing AI create her husband having a conversation even though he is dead that must be weird for his family full stop moving on in a not so shocking admission a Pfizer executive has stated that the company did not know if the covid-19 MRNA vaccine that it developed would prevent viral transmission before bringing it to the market last year yeah her name is Janine small and she is the president of International Development markets for Pfizer and she was made to testify before the European parliament's covid-19 committee on behalf of the Pfizer CEO Dr Albert borla who was summoned by the committee but he had to pull out because pull out of his appointment so she testified in his place and they asked her straight up did you think that these vaccines when you brought them to Market would make people immune to covet 19. take a listen to what she had to say was the Pfizer covet vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market if not please say it clearly if yes are you willing to share the data with this committee and I really want a straight answer yes or no and I'm looking forward to it thank you very much regarding the question around um did we know about stop and humanization before it's entered the market no these um you know we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market I'm sorry what you just didn't know you had no idea whether or not it was actually going to make people immune and yet the messaging the lockstep messaging and the censorship all said that it was safe and effective so do you want to then give us the updated definition of effective you had no idea whether or not people that were rolling up their sleeves testing the product of course because if you didn't have people that tested the product and knew that it was actually effective then it meant that millions of people around the world were the test dummies million people around the world became the lab mice for this product so please let us know you updated the definition of vaccine the CDC updated it because they could no longer say that it makes you immune so can you at least now let us know what the updated definition of safe is because children dropping dead from heart attacks and myocarditis is still allegedly safe so can we get that update we need it can we also do an updated effective if it means that it actually isn't effective and you can still catch and spread covid which people like me have been saying forever that people I knew that were getting the vaccine obviously understood that it wasn't nearly as effective that they wanted you to believe when they demanded that you roll up your sleeve and get it we were all being censored so yeah I do think that it would be best if we just keep changing the language to update the criminality that has taken place to go and line the criminology that has taken place is what you guys are are a bunch of criminals and you should all be in prison right and I promise you and I will eventually figure out who this person was on Twitter who tweeted the other day so what you got the vaccine because you wanted to get the vaccine no one made you get the vaccine oh the ultimate gaslighting now they're telling you of course we knew that it was not going to make you immune to covid-19 but so what you agreed to get it a threat that you'd never see your loved ones again right you're not going to be able to get on a plane or go into another country if your loved ones live there unless you agree to get this product which we had no idea whether or not was going to make you immune yeah threat that if you didn't get the vaccine you weren't going to be allowed to keep your job or feed your family but no that's your decision it was your decision the ultimate gaslighting and I just want to say I am so grateful that I had to wherewithal and that I had no response to the very concerted effort the media the Western media propaganda that took place during copen19 it was the most severe propaganda that I've ever seen take place during my entire life and yet I withstood it and me and my family remained and remained unvaccinated because I will not allow criminals to dictate what I put inside of my body how's that for a little truth moving on to the dark Direction keeping in line with this dark dark direction that the big Pharma and the medical industry is headed toward I have been beating the drum about euthanasia and I've been shocked that people think it's totally fine some people at least I read your comments on YouTube and some of you guys are like so what if someone's suicide they should be allowed to kill themselves so they don't kill themselves in a messy way and I just keep thinking to myself who do you think has the right to determine if you should kill yourself I mean what school what a school of medicine to train people to kill other human beings because they're stressed out or they're under they understandably are stressed out they've gone through something traumatic so rather than dealing with a trauma we should just kill them well that's what just recently happened so there was a woman who survived the Brussels Airport terror attack and she has now died after choosing to be euthanized due to severe depression and PTSD that she suffered following the incident at that airport her name is Shanti de Court she was 23 years old and she was having constant panic attacks and bouts of dark depression from which she never felt that she emerged from despite attending a psychiatric hospital in her hometown of Antwerp for rehabilitation and taking a range of antidepressant medications she was unable to shake the depression and she attempted to take her own life on two different occasions once in 2018 and again in 2020. well earlier this year she just decided that it would be best if she was euthanized a procedure which I told you is legal in Belgium it is legal in Canada and she died on May 7 2022 after two psychiatrists approved her request it's always a psychiatrist that just have this amazing ability I went to school I'm a psychiatrist and I have assessed you and decided that you are somehow stable enough to want to kill yourself obviously if you want to kill yourself you're not mentally stable but they can determine that you're stable enough to make the drastic decision at 22 years old after surviving a real trauma the best way to deal with that trauma is you didn't survive you did survive the attack in the airport but you're not going to survive the emotions that you're dealing with after so kill yourself it's psychiatrists decided that she was fit to do that the same psychiatrists that are deciding that children are fit to pick their gender that children are fit to take puberty blockers that children are somehow capable of understanding the long-term side effects of their puberty blockers they're now being allowed to tell young adults that they should just kill themselves it's disgusting in one final social media post the day that she was euthanized she wrote quote I was laughing and crying until the last day I loved and was allowed to feel what true love is now I will go away in peace know that I miss you already is that not at all disturbing to you seriously I'm going to read your comments I want you to if you're listening to the podcast to make sure you find a place to comment on this segment and tell me whether or not you're not disturbed by that that you think yeah well it's better as some people in the comments said before because it can be messy when people kill themselves and jump off of buildings and so it's better for everybody else it's more convenient if they're just given a pill or an injection and allowed to just die in peace you just starts to start killing soldiers that come back with PTSD by that very same logic right oh are you stressed out because you saw people dying overseas and you haven't been around your loved one for years as you were stationed overseas yeah well here's a pill just kill yourself people think that that is a healthy direction to head toward and they trust that these psychiatrists who don't know difference between men and women are qualified to determine that and torp prosecutors rightfully have begun an investigation after receiving complaints from a neurologist at the UCC brugman academic clinical Hospital in Brussels who said that the decision to euthanize the young girl was made prematurely yeah go figure euthanizing 22 year olds might be a little premature but the federal commission for the control and evaluation of euthanasia in Belgium did you know that there was actually a federal commission that oversees this they actually had no concerns over the case the neurologists argued that there were still different modalities of care and Treatment available to Shanti that were not tried yeah so there you have it and I am just continually sickened by the death industry that has been perpetuated around the world and it sickened me that some people think it's righteous it really does I'm very disturbed by this over and over again speaking of things that I'm not even gonna say I'm disturbed by at this point I just have more questions and I have answers a lizzo of course she I almost feel like she's the new cardi B it's the person that the media has decided should be glorified no matter what in fact this past week they are hitting Kanye over suggesting that clinical obesity is not something that should be promoted and understanding that clinical obesity instead is something that we should be discussing and trying to fix so Twitter has run a banner that has been for the last I don't know three days saying that lizzo hits back at you know Kanye West by essentially just saying that she likes being fat and they're making this seem like this is the right way to hit back no we should discuss political obesity and we should discuss it with a sober analysis so lizzo did this Vanity Fair cover story she was a Vanity Fair cover story and here are a few of her quotes on Race she said quote the way black women have been treated in this country has made me feel very hopeless I don't think there was a time when we were treated fairly and with respect if I see hope in this country it will come from the accountability of the people who have the privilege as a fat black woman this country has no ever gone forward it's stayed pretty much the same for me okay so I do want to just ask the question to lizzo what's it going to take for you to feel like you're privileged like I actually want someone to tell me that's like when will lizzo get on stage and say I have a remarkable amount of privilege I am a multi-millionaire I'm giving awards I am doing deals with Netflix I am doing deals with instacart I am being handed questionable trophies for the work that I am doing I am now on the cover of Vanity Fair one of the biggest magazines fashion magazines in the world and I am essentially being glorified for things that I actually should make a committed effort to better in my life like my clinical obesity but despite all of this they're telling me that it's great it's amazing and I'm being defended by everybody but it's not it's not a privilege because I'm black so I'm just wondering what does it take for society to admit that any black person has privilege any black person give me Malia and Sasha Obama I I'm sure that despite their perfectly cushioned life despite their multi-million dollar homes despite their Martha Vineyard Mansion despite being able to have a party for their dad while everybody else was locked down in covet in Martha's Vineyard maskless whoa we're having a good time because my dad was a former president I'm sure they could still get on stage and they could still do an interview and say that it's just hard for black people and that they still feel that pain so I am wondering I'm posing a question to the world give me a list give me the comment that I can read out loud that says this is what it is going to take for us to admit that a black person in society has privilege because to me lizzo is now a stunning example of privilege but she's black so we're not allowed to say that no no matter what you are still allowed to be a victim and she is speaking out by the way about this idea that when she performs there's a lot of white people in the crowd she doesn't like that she has said quote I am not making music for white people I am a black woman I am making music from my black experience for me to heal myself from the experience that we call life end quote oh okay well I'm gonna have to say hashtag White lives matter to that I don't know why we say these things what is I am not making music for white people mean could could a white artist could Taylor Swift could have been interviewing say I am not making music for black people I am making music from my white experience for me to heal myself from the experience that we call Life Could Taylor Swift say that question again just wondering I have no answers here I'm just wondering if there would that would be totally fine fine and if it is fine then okay I'm okay with this interview then we have achieved equality we've achieved a quality of Taylor Swift can say that she doesn't make music for black people if it's only fine when lizzo says it then no we haven't achieved equality we have just recreated a form of racism that we feel is permissible in society moving on to more black suffering no matter what um I don't even really know how to tell you about this because it seems like it's fiction but New York City May in fact need Batman or Spider-Man somebody that can beat up the Green Goblin gang because there is a Green Goblin gang and if you have no idea what I'm talking about a bunch of black women that were dressed in neon green part of a gang jumped on to the subway and began to Pummel two 19 year old women at a Time Square subway train stop and they were released without bail on Tuesday but I want to actually have you guys take a look at this video take a listen to this video because it's insane to take a listen now my producer as we were watching this video it looks like there's about eight uh younger black women that are just beating up people that are dressed in these neon green nylon outfits covering their faces but with holes cut out for their ponytails which is even like just more weird I don't know it just this is a very bizarre video and I don't mean to laugh at these victims but when my producer saw this video she said who is the person recording this right like how could you just allow this to happen and I said in defense of the person recording it I wouldn't know what to make of it I don't think that my brain would be able to process that I was witnessing a crime I don't know what I would think if a bunch of people that were dressed in neon green from head to toe but with spaces cut out for their ponytails jumped onto a plane and started screaming and shouting and cursing I would I would I would maybe think that I was watching the Jabbawockeez like they were maybe going to break out into a dance or that I was being a part of something I was being entertained or maybe it was an experiment and this was some sort of art experiment I definitely would not have thoughts that people were being harmed or mugged instantly your brain just can't process something this bizarre but yes this is this is what has happened in New York City who has been lacks New York City which has been lacks on crime for a very long time now you are having people that are indulging in Fantastical crime is what I see this as honestly this is a Batman plot line so the woman that was arrested her name is Miriam esoph they caught one of them she was 26 and she was cut loose on supervised release after being arraigned on a second degree robbery charge in the October 2nd video that I just played for you one day after she turned herself into the cops with her defense attorney at her side so she actually turned herself in and hopefully they will get the rest of these young women and hopefully Batman and Robin and Superman and Spider-Man will Assemble and save the people in these liberal hellhole cities yep that's all I have to say about that all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on Botox and pro-choice OB gyns and then later tonight is the premiere of my documentary guys 8pm Eastern the greatest lie ever sold that is where you need to be make sure you're wearing black make sure you are tagging me in your funeral outfits as you watch this I'll be sharing some of the best outfits and the best greatest I ever sold parties all across my Instagram throughout the night so if you are not a member that is even more reason for you to go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "1XSd_QB4uwY": "i also want to get to some great news uh that parlor which was the second twitter it's actually pronounced parlay but we're american so we say parlor um is back on iphones the social media app has returned to the apples app and also in the news today which is being reported and which has been me having to keep a secret for so long the new ceo of parlor is my husband george farmer i can get on parlor now yeah get on parlor get on parlor can't say that enough you know after the january 6th thing happened and you guys will recall apple just took them out and if there's any proof that apple has become a monopoly and that they're all including together it's taking out a brand new tech company um and saying january 6th is somehow your fault but also donald trump's fault even though trump was never on parlor i have a question is george aware that parlor with an o is a pornographic site which i found in the hotel lobby this morning is that your excuse where is the ogo hopefully where it should if you know what i mean um i stepped in that oh my god but you know we got involved after the january 6th thing happened you know obviously i'm always trying to do everything i'm suing facebook when i salvated a parlor we instantly called people that were behind and said how can we help we want to help as much as we can um my husband has experience running companies he you know stepped in and was sort of informally helping them and it kind of went on uh to a bigger role and now he's he is the uh ceo of the company and i can't say enough how important it is like these battles that we're talking about with big tech collusion these these monopolies that are going on even alex jones love them or hate him the idea that on the same day apple facebook twitter and google all banned him should let you know that they are literally controlling a monopoly right now in this country and they're trying to control our voices you know there's no reason that you ban alec jones and all of them and ban parlor but you don't ban these other people who are lunatics they're caught lying on a day-to-day basis they're threatening people like chrissy teigen and they don't do nothing to them there's no consequences and i hate to see it because you know whether whether you like alex jones or not there's a lot of things that he said about kovac that has come to fruition and i remember riding my bike in the in the room getting my extra listen to alex jones all day going crazy and he was right right you know so but i don't like the fact that they use their platforms and they're supposed to be impartial if they came out and said we're a complete leftist and we support the left then that's different they're supposed to be impartial and they come out and counsel us and going back to the first segment that's why i like what happened to chrissy teigen is that they need to get a dose of their own medicine when it comes to cancellation for justifiable wrongs right well i mean yeah absolutely yeah ronald applause that and what i will say is that you know the reason that we were given that parlor had to be taken away was because it was inciting violence for january 6th you know which will forever be to me the grandma selfie party that took place in congress um you know for january 6 you were told also alex jones had to go because he was inciting violence you were told that donald trump had to be white from the internet because he was inciting violence even though factually speaking they cannot produce a tweet in which donald trump incited violence and yet christie tegan gets a platform in accolades and she has literally on their platforms been sliding into the dms publicly and privately saying commit suicide what's a more clear example of inciting violence what about blm right how does black lives matter have a actual instagram they probably have accounts everywhere and they have killed people right people businesses have been burned down they threaten people on a day-to-day basis racial threats they're an anti-semitic hate group that's a delaware corporation by the way and by the way the leading case on incitement everyone cute on the internet is like inciting instruction and inciting an instruction i actually read the case of brandenburg versus ohio where those words are used and it explains what inciting an insurrection is and it is nothing that we have seen the defendant in that case was a neo-nazi kkk member who is a horrible unspeakable crappy human being and the supreme court said he he advocated essentially for like horrible things for jews and i'm a jew i converted i worked really hard to be a jew and i read this case worked really hard i did it's hard they don't just let you in i worked really hard but i read that case with an open mind knowing that you know these people would hate me and want to kill me and my family and that wasn't even inciting an interaction yeah saying to basically kill jews yeah so you the people that say incite an insurrection because it's a buzzword and a buzz raid phrase need to go back and read cases like that and understand what it means it's not anything that we have seen in the last year right weakest insurrection on planet earth yeah they walk i saw grandma's in there taking selfies oh podiums and they didn't they didn't come with it and then and then the same day that they supposedly had the worst insurrection in american history they still finished the vote right they didn't do nothing they finished the vote and they went on about their business i just i like what they tried to do with the word fight as if like we wouldn't notice that everyone says fight all the time in politics because you know trump said fight and they're like he wanted people to go down and kill everybody what like i don't know the what about isms people hate that's literally the only thing that matters he goes you guys say i almost cars fight all the time that was gross um yeah man i couldn't agree more and so yes you guys you can if you have an iphone you can now rejoin parlor they were at their peak millions of millions are joining every day and that's why they took him out because they want to really what we know is they don't want conservatives to be able to convene they want to criminalize conservatives coming together they tried to criminalize mega rallies they tried to criminalize being on parlor even though they say we don't want you on twitter then we go somewhere else and suddenly it's like well you can't be on there either and you know it is a it's a very serious topic because the censorship that we're seeing in america is not something that i think

folks and my question for you today is are you on Reddit you guys know what I'm talking about the red is a bunch of forums a bunch of different communities have you ever been there have you ever jumped on to see what's taking place on Reddit if you haven't don't worry because we're going to discuss it it's turning into something very dark plus I'll be giving you my thoughts on the Gigi Hadid and Kanye drama as well as the Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen divorce all that and more today I'm Candace Owens [Music] thank you okay before we continue I want to take a quick pause to talk to you about the app hallow you all know that my faith is super important to me my relationship with God is how I find my strength and peace in this crazy world and with all of the insane anti-religious ideologies that are being pushed by the left on a daily basis it can be hard to tune out the noise and remember what we know is good and true which is why I love hallow hallow is the number one Christian Prayer app in the U.S and the number one Catholic app in the world it's rooted in the Catholic tradition but an amazing resource for any Christian looking to dive deeper into their prayer life this is perfect for me and my family because as most of you know I'm in a mixed Faith household my husband is a devout Catholic and I am Protestant hallo has prayers and meditations to guide you throughout your entire day morning tonight some of the most popular prayers include the daily Rosary Gospel reading and daily Psalm with Bishop Baron plus there are minute meditations meditations for Sleep kids prayers and meditations hallow helps me sleep better lower my anxiety levels and find peace and calm throughout the day and I think it will do the same for you try it for three months free at hallow.com Candace that's hallow.com Candace reclaim your piece and download hello today all right so A continuing theme on the show is that we have been talking about the harms and the ills associated with social media I think that's very important and I want to make sure that I use my platform to continually impress upon that point and to make sure you know what's happening online so that if you have a child and you're thinking about allowing them to explore social media you know what harms they should look out for as just one example last week we discussed Tick Tock which I still hold the opinion is the most harmful app of them all but we talked about how this chinese-owned app was artificially boosting these perverted accounts remember there was this guy who was frolicking through the woods in a video saying this is my first day as a woman you would think that it was meant to be a joke but now he's receiving an award third over at Forbes for the Forbes Women's Summit and so you start to wonder if there's something more nefarious going on if they're intentionally putting a spotlight and highlighting these horrific accounts because they want to further corrode American culture and what we're talking about by the way when we talk about that it would be essentially an anti-marketing firm right so if you are running a marketing firm you want to promote things that are good right I want you to buy my product I think my product is great so how can I get more eyeballs on this product but if you're an anti-marketing firm if you're thinking about it in the same vein and you're China and you're thinking forget me wanting to sell you a product that I think is good but I want to detract people and bring them to something that is harmful to make sure that in the end it benefits me right it benefits China we want to weaken Americans over time what better way to do that than to destroy and attack the American Family destroy and attack what it means to be a man destroy and attack what it means to be a woman conflate the two confuse the children and promote bad principles this brings me to Reddit now I used to by the way be obsessed with Reddit especially when I was pregnant for the first time because I was not able to sleep well and I'd be tossing and turn learning and I used to love to open Reddit so if you're not familiar with what Reddit is I'll tell you what it is it's basically a social media app that allows you to subscribe to certain threads right you can start a thread so let's say I want to start a thread and I my thread is fashion and you like fashion and it allows people to anonymously post under that thread so you could be the writer and you can say just saw Candace Owens wearing this amazing outfit and then a bunch of other Anonymous people everyone on Reddit is anonymous want to make that clear can comment and upload it and say I like this or I like that I started realizing with time that Reddit was incredibly left leaning and if you ever posted anything as a conservative it would be downloaded all the time but if you promoted promoted things that were clearly left-leaning ideologies it would suddenly get a lot of attention I started asking my question myself a question how do we know these are actually real people it's Anonymous so if you are operating and as I'm describing it an anti-marketing firm this would be a perfect place for you to promote artificially artificially boost up these Reddit threads of things that are horrific and bad and backwards and you could even employ people to full time just write comments and to pretend that the majority of people feel this way the majority of people think trans is good look it's got a million upvotes this person coming out and saying that he is a woman or or this girl that's coming out and saying she now identifies as a male so I'm starting to realize that this app is getting deeper and it's getting darker somebody reminded me of a particular community on Reddit that is so dystopian and it's so dark and that Community is called Child free okay so there is a legitimate community on Reddit and everyone that is subscribed to it's 1.5 million subscribers these are Anonymous subscribers some but sure actually these people unite around the idea that your life will be better if you never have a family right if you never have children I remember seeing this feed because it had been heavily promoted and I remember seeing content of individuals who would just post a photo let's say you're at the airport and you see a kid crying and you see the parents struggling with that child trying to calm them down well an individual that was a part of this community would snap that photo put you into this Reddit community and say a reminder while I'm why I'm so happy that I don't have kids and people would upvote it and they would start laughing and they'd say oh my God yes look at that toddler throwing a temper tantrum and this is what the community is based on I remember reading a particular thread where somebody had posted legitimately asking for help so this was a male that was posting and he was turning this community saying please intervene and give me some advice because I'm going through a horrific situation and the situation was as follows he was dating a woman and they had agreed to be Child free they had agreed that neither of them had wanted children they had been together for some eight years suddenly the woman was about 32 years old she decided that she wanted to have children go figure I guess suddenly her biology was catching up with her and he freaks out and says oh no there must be something wrong with this we Post in this community saying please somebody help and then he says I think that she's going crazy because she recently switched her birth control so I think that she's becoming hormonally imbalanced and this is not actually what she wants so I'm reading this thinking oh my gosh what an insane individual he's basically has a woman in his life who is having a natural biological physiological inclination to start a family and he thinks that she's crazy that something's gone wrong with her birth control pills surely everyone's going to tell him he's out of his mind nope all of the subsequent comments that I read on this thread were people telling him to sit her down and to explain to her that this can be the effects of changing your birth control and that she needs to go back to the old birth control they were apologetic they were sympathetic they were saying to him that he was going to get through this and he just had to make her realize that she was having a hormonal reaction from being on the wrong birth control I mean how dystopian and anti-family is that to think that they're trying to essentially diagnose this woman as crazy because she wants children so if you see this thread you'll see this over and over again here's one such example of another post and this one is entitled not having the abortion is the biggest regret of my life and I'm going to skim through this she writes I posted about this on another sub to Vents and I was recommended to post here for support when I got pregnant all I wanted was to abort I never wanted to be a mom it was the time between getting my arm implant birth control replaced so we were using condoms but part of me now wonders if he sabotaged them somehow I always thought we were on the same page about kids but he was so happy when I told him that I was pregnant I was horrified I wanted to get rid of it and decided telling everyone and having them guilt-trip me was the best way to handle it but I guess he was right because it worked I caved I kept telling myself and it would be okay he was sticking around to help me this didn't have to ruin my life I could go back to school and finish my degree it would be fine I read all the mommy Forum posts and Reddit posts of moms in my position who talked about how glad they were that they didn't go through with the abortion and were so happy and loved their child more than anything and I convinced myself to believe them I was wrong so effing wrong biggest regret of my life he left one month before the birth gone no way to contact him I was left to do this on my own I wanted to kill myself then and there it was too late for the abortion I missed my chance to be free he stole that from me when I decided to go to route of adoption all of my friends and families treated me like I was a monster my mom was especially cruel I was sub-human disgusting how could I not want my own baby and I made the second biggest mistake I paid for a second time and I kept him I never got that flood of love and emotion that people talk about I felt too repulsed to breastfeed him everyone told me to give it six months that sometimes it takes a while that I would love him more than anything that never happened I was more miserable than ever then they told me to give it a year that being unhappy is normal but I can't imagine disliking your own child as normal I spent my whole childhood faking how I felt and going through the motions and I did the same now I dissociated most of the time and sunk deeper down in a mental spiral at a year old I couldn't take it anymore I felt like if I didn't give him a someone else I was going to kill myself six months later the adoption was done and it was the first time that I felt free in so long I cried I was so happy so it goes on and on and she's describing how happy she is that she got rid of her child in this child free community and basically she gets 549 comments applauding her telling her how sorry they are and how awful children are and and she's grateful and writes back and says thank you guys so much for all of the kind responses they're overwhelming I am so glad that I found this community um and I wanted to just bring this to your attention because we routinely on this podcast talk about this leftish push towards anti-family now I'm not saying that there are reasons that she had a traumatizing experience I can't imagine having a man that walked out after you became pregnant and wasn't there to assure you it's very difficult by the way being a single mom which is why it's horrific that the single mom culture is glorified so much in the media and throughout the music but what is horrible is that she can plug into a community that mocks families and that makes it seem much people that have children are doing something that's antithetical to their species right like it's like why on Earth would you want to have productive families why on Earth would you want to raise a child why would you think that you're going to feel love at the end of that and when we talk about all of the various topics the one thing that unites all of the leftist talking points is an attack on the family we talk about the climate change Lobby which insists that it's irresponsible to have children right we talk about the trans agenda teaching children to mutilate their bodies before they can become reproductive adults and start their own families we talk about why they hate God so much why they are so atheist and committed to atheism is because ultimately what they're after is statism right they want the state to be able to control every aspect of your life and what stands between the state and omnipotence are strong families so keep your eye on this know that this stuff exists the more that we know the better we can make decisions down the line in terms of what access we provide our children to these social media apps which have become so harmful and that's all I have to say about that okay now it's time for some topics to June [Music] I feel like I'm getting better at saying topics every time I feel like I say it now better because I went to Paris and so I'm trying on my French accent everywhere um speaking of Paris you guys obviously know that I broke the internet because I wore a white lives matter t-shirt how dare I well I dare to do it because it's true my lives matter right if black lives matter White lives matter Asian lives matter I don't know what the problem is but apparently there is a problem and speaking of Reddit I want to draw this to your attention so problematic so problematic was it that Connie and I decided to wear these t-shirts that a Reddit thread uh was started the community on Reddit is called NYC influencer snark and somebody anonymously posted celebs that follow Candace Owens question mark question mark and they are doing this because they want to draw to attention what celebrities follow me you know I have what 4.3 million followers followers they can now conclude that if you follow Candace Owens you must therefore be somebody that supports ideas that they disagree with and so what they're trying to do is create an army to go after and to attack these individuals now I speak about a range of topics who knows why people follow me it might be simply because they hate me and they're following me because they're journalists and they want to report on the things that I say a lot of journalists follow me maybe you're an influencer and you follow Candace Owens because I speak out about the childhood vaccine schedule because you are pregnant and you are thinking about having children and so you follow me because you're waiting for that information maybe you follow me because gasp you like me and you think I'm awesome and you just want to follow maybe you follow me because you love the family stuff the pro family stuff that I that I post maybe you follow me because you enjoyed the stuff that I said about Donald Trump during his policy I don't know what the reason is for each and every individual follow I know I have a lot of haters and I have a lot of lovers out there but irrespective of what your reasons are This Thread is essentially demanding that people are harassed that's what they're asking for right the the party of Tolerance the tolerant people they're so tolerant that they want to have an army to send on you they want to send an army out to say this person should lose their job if you read throughout the thread people commenting it's like oh my gosh this person oh my God this person we should report this person for this I hope this person gets fired they're even suggesting that somebody who works for Peloton who recently got fired and happened to have followed me maybe he got fired for following me which would be the most bizarre thing in the entire world Imagine your boss sitting you down and saying we're letting you go because we realized that you follow Kanye West would be like I'm sorry what yeah we realize that you're following Kanye West and so we're gonna have to let you go is this really where the world is coming to that individuals now have to be concerned about who they're following on Instagram I accidentally follow people I mean sometimes literally I go to my phone list and I'm like wow I must have just been scrolling and hit the follow button I have no idea why I'm following this individual well you better be careful with your thumbs and careful with your fingers because God forbid you accidentally followed me you might be losing your job this is what the people on the left are all about acceptance tolerance we love love is love except really we hate you unless you agree with every single thing that we say and unless you comply with the individuals that we say you should like how's that for the party and the group of the most tolerant in America keep your eye on that because it's pretty sick and it's pretty Twisted moving on however I want to talk about Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen allegedly divorce right they're saying it is being alleged that they have both hired divorce lawyers we know that she has not been present at any of his games which is strange um it is out of habit for her again I'm not trying to draw conclusions but it was recently linked to page six that they have been living completely separately and that the trouble began because you know he notoriously announced that he was retiring from football and he gave um basically comments that it was time for him to let his wife shine Gisele Bundchen stepped back from her career to raise their kids and he was excited to be spending more time with his family so getting back to the importance of family this was a celebrated announcement everybody knows Tom Brady is arguably the best quarterback of all time he has proven that time and time again that he is an incredible athlete even as he is getting older he still seems to be the best quarterback and people applauded him and there were tears and just celebrating the amazingness of all that he accom published on the field well now a source says that quote there's been trouble in the marriage over his decision to unretire Giselle has always been the one with the kids they had agreed that he would retire to focus on the family then he changed his mind end quote and there was also a quote that Giselle gave herself to British Vogue she said I don't think relationships just happen it's never the fairy tale people want to believe it is it takes work to be really in sync with someone especially after you have kids his focus is on his career mine is mostly on the kids and you know I think that that is true uh and and that he has admitted that as I said by himself so it's very sad to me that it appears at least that at being given the option to have had everything he wanted to have had the amazing career he wanted to have accomplished things that most people will never know who knows when Tom Brady's record will be broken his Super Bowl record will be broken but despite having everything the perfect life quite literally the model wife that he's unable to do something that is selfless and what marriage takes is selflessness right you have to renew that commitment to a person every day and say that I am not the bigger person in this relationship sometimes it's you having to uh remove a little bit of yourself sometimes it's the your partner and spouse who has to remove a little bit of themself so that you can have this Union so that you can stay in sync and it seems that when this came to Tom Brady when he had an opportunity to say thank you so much for being a wonderful wife thank you so much for being a wonderful mother and thank you for allowing me to have this career I am now going to step back he changed his mind and it's understandable that she feels this way I can I can understand how broken she must feel she must be questioning whether or not he ever really loved and supported her or if he really just loved how much he supported his career if there was always this underlying selfishness that's always existed My Hope Is that despite hiring these divorce lawyers that both of them understand the commitment that they made to one another um and the vows that they said which people I feel today say and don't truly mean don't really understand what it means to have a union that exists um and I hope that he re-explores it and that he announces randomly in the middle of the Season that he's leaving and he's going back home and that he goes and loves his wife in the capacity that she deserves to be loved for all of her tremendous sacrifices so Tom Brady if for some reason you're watching this us we all love you we love you as an athlete but I promise you we will love you more as a true leader of your household go get the girl next story I want to jump right into is that you know if you were imagining that Facebook and Twitter were interfering in elections and you maybe said that and got your post taken down Facebook has come right out and announced that there will be 40 teams with hundreds of people working on the midterms focused on quote preventing voter interference connecting people with reliable information and providing industry-leading transparency for ads about social issues elections and politics so they're going to prevent voter interference by interfering does that sound confusing to you yeah I mean they're just they are going to make sure that people don't share things without their approval they have hired the teams that are going to be smart enough to understand exactly what it is that you need to see just like they were super smart and understanding um that Hunter Biden's laptop was not something that needed to be seen and so they all colluded and took down the information which would have let you know that the Biden crime family had a crackhead who was doing deals overseas using his father and doing deals in Ukraine and doing deals in China right they made sure that you didn't know about that until after the election because they wanted to make sure that Biden won but so it's it's interference what's their interference essentially they are going to be the people that is going to be between you and the information that might allow you to think for yourself allow Facebook and Twitter to do the thinking for you So Meta Meta I know Facebook is now called meta Nick plague his name is Nick Clegg pardon he's the president of global Affairs and he said that they will partner with the Biden Administration through an alliance with the cyber security and infrastructure Security Agency the reason why that makes me laugh and uh when I say laugh I mean it is a dark sense of humor is because weigh that against the headlines of them telling us all the time that Putin is interfering with elections and we are the only ones that know how to do things fairly Putin is censoring people evil Vladimir Putin censoring getting involved in elections and we're just supposed to go yeah that could never happen in the west except it's happening in the west and we're not even allowed to say that we believe that our elections have been stolen even when they come right out and they say that they're going to interfere with elections we still can't post and say Facebook is admitting at their interview with elections because that could be information that is harmful to the regime that we are existing under okay stop thinking that the Western philosophy is somehow better or different than the Eastern philosophy in the East they just do it outright to the corruption in the west they do it outright and then they make sure that these social media companies and these Legacy Media companies hide all the information from us so that is all I have to say about that next up in the continuing drama between uh Kanye West and all of these celebrities who love black lives matter you know they just really care about black people Gigi Hadid was apparently very upset and thought that it would be a good idea to use her platform to speak out on behalf of Vogue editor Gabriella karifa Johnson probably because this Vogue editor is black and this would have been some good virtue signaling for Gigi Hadid so she speaks out because Gabriella karifa Johnson the Vogue editor was invited to a show she was there and as she was at the show she somehow made the show about herself and pretended that she was under attack so she was posting live on Instagram throughout the show first she posts a black model walking down the runway who was wearing a white lives matter shirt she posted a photo of her and wrote here comes the [\u00a0__\u00a0] followed by I'm fuming collecting my thoughts DM me for my working thesis indefensible behavior and then she wrote on her Instagram page it's become clear that some viewers think my previous post containing my working evolving thoughts on Kanye's show was some sort of distorted justification for the incredibly irresponsible and dangerous Act of sending White lives Matter t-shirts down a Runway dangerous my God please understand it wasn't the t-shirts this man conceived produced and shared with the world are pure violence okay there is no excuse there is no art here I'm sorry I failed to make that clear I thought I did I do think if you asked Kanye he would say there was Art and Revolution and all the things in that t-shirt there isn't as we all work through the trauma of this moment especially those of us who suffered in that room let's have some Grace for one another Gabriella K Vogue editor trauma violence dangerous suffering all of my favorite leftist bingo words she's so sad guys she had to go to Paris and go into a room and watch a billionaire present his show and God forbid she saw a T-shirt and she's now suffering trauma I mean could she speak even louder could she ever be clearer in the message that I have about how weak Black America has become decades ago you had people like my grandfather who grew up on sharecropping Farms right who had to wake up at the crack of dawn and Under the Carolina heat lay out crops to dry when he was five years old fast forward and you got big girl Gabriella uh in her really ugly shoes which is what Kanye came back to her and said that you are clearly he posted on his Instagram and said this is not a fashion person and he's right if you see what she's wearing she looks absolutely ridiculous she was probably a diversity and inclusion hire over at Vogue but fast forward to years later decades later and this woman thinks this is suffering she actually thinks she's suffering because she was made to go to a fashion show in Paris this is pathetic this woman is pathetic worse than unfashionable she is emblematic of the corrosion of Black America while they're trying to tell you that we're strong right because we're wearing BLM t-shirts and writing looting our own communities what you're actually seeing is a severely weakened Community severely with the community and emotionally weak Community that's the truth and that's why people hate me because I just tell them the truth you're weak so Gigi Hadid decided to jump in in defense of this woman and she wrote to Kanye you wish you had a percentage of her intellect you have no idea if there's actually a point to any of your she might be the only person that could save you as if the honor of being invited to your show should keep someone from giving their opinion LOL you're a bully and a joke that's from Gigi Hadid what interesting about Gigi Hadid by the way fun fact her sister is Bella Hadid who's another model who I actually thought quite bravely used her platform uh they are Palestinian and she sort of stood up to the Mob that was telling her that Hollywood is not allowed to be pro-palestine I don't have a horse in the race don't need to get into it but you know Israel and Palestine have been in Conflict it feels like since forever the Israelis and the Palestinians pardon um and she Bella Hadid stood up and said what's happening a Palestinian is wrong you head up the media attacking her and she kind of withstood the storm to say this is my perspective as somebody who is Palestinian Gigi was silent though she didn't say anything so it's weird that this is what she decides to use her platform for a fashion dispute and I weighed in and asked her if she is going to be speaking out on bullying in Hollywood I'd love to see it I think you're great I think your mom's great I think Bella's great where were you on Chrissy Teigen because she was actually if you think Kanye posting a picture of this woman and saying that she dresses bad which is like saying water is wet right it's a form of bullying where were you on Chrissy Teigen when she was celebrated by the media for years and I used my platform to expose how she was telling teenagers to kill themselves Connie didn't tell Gabriella to kill herself your shoulders should dress better and she should because she's at Vogue and Anna Wintour probably doesn't like her shoes like Kanye said I don't know just an opinion so we will leave that out for Gigi and and see if she's going to continue to weigh in on bullying The Bullying that takes place in Hollywood routinely and the bullying that is taking place right now because Kanye refuses to conform to the black lives matter narrative which all of you just wear the t-shirts and post black squares to make yourself feel like you're getting involved in helping Black America when the evidence is in front of you you're not you're harming us so please stop doing that please Gigi next up we have Matt Walsh my friend and my colleague versus Media Matters Media Matters for those of you that know they watch every second they're watching right now but they do do something even more interesting they will go back right and they will climb through everything you've ever said to see if they can pull something up re-share it and present it as if you're a monster so they did this to me notoriously when they took an excerpt out of a speech that I was giving in London actually the night that I met my husband and I was talking about nationalism as to whether I was speaking as to whether or not it was a dirty word and they took me out of concept out of context and they basically had me saying well you know if Hitler just wanted to stay in Germany that would have been fine obviously my full thought which they did not want everyone to see was basically saying that for some reason nationalism is wrongly attributed to Hitler and obviously he wasn't a nationalist because he was invading other countries if he had just wanted to stay in Germany and lead the Germans into Prosperity then no one would have had a problem but instead what he was doing was being a monster executing atrocities against the Jewish people and invading into other countries but who cares don't let facts get in the way of a good time especially if you're on George soros's team and so they Unearthed a Matt Walsh speaking about teenage pregnancy and I guess what they're trying to make it seem is is as if he is a groomer because he's talking about the fact that teenage pregnancy used to be normal so why don't you take a listen yourself to what Matt Walsh said and let me know if you view it as problematic in fact ever since the beginning of time teenage girls have been getting pregnant it used to be more common the peak ever since I started keeping records of these things which they only started doing recently like in the 20th century but ever since they started keeping records in 1957 was the peak for teenage pregnancy 1957 not 2009 not today all of them were supposed to have kids like that's when we had kids that's my point okay um so to all of a sudden act like this phenomenon of girls getting pregnant at that at a young age that we consider young 16 or 17. to act like it's a new thing is ridiculous it's always been that way uh even biologically and this is me just stating I'm just right now I'm going to start by just stating facts so fact number one it's not a new phenomenon fact number two in fact it's a phenomenon that was more common earlier in history and for you know the first six to ten thousand years of human existence it was a normal thing uh fact three girls between the ages of like 17 and 24 is when they're technically most fertile yeah okay that's biological that's a fact all right I'm just stating facts that's all I'm doing but what happened recently and this is the the fourth fact recently in the last 30 years or so we decided that that's way too young to start a family why and uh because now horse rates would probably go up and once you're that young you can't really make sure that no no no no no no no no no no girls were getting married early and marriages were lasting longer you very rarely hear about like these these relationships that go to their uh what is it your diamond anniversary your 50th anniversary and all this I it's that's a dying breed of people out there yeah and those all were all people that got married very young that's why that's why they're still alive yeah that's why you can have someone in their 70s who's celebrating their you know uh 55th wedding anniversary so you you get it yeah everything he said makes perfect sense obviously my mother had her first child when she was 17 years old my grandparents my grandfather was one of 17 they had children also they got married when they were 17 they stayed together until my grandmother's dying day some 40 plus years later so it is true people were obviously having children younger they were getting married younger and they were staying together for a longer time so what Matthew is talking about is that there was clearly a social change we decided suddenly that teen pregnancy was wrong that getting married wasn't aspirational that women should instead go to college and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars getting an education only to realize that they can't really make money in the real world and then to freak out as they're running up against their biological clock and try to find someone to marry last second only then discovered that maybe that marriage didn't really work out yeah that was a social change not a biological one not a physiological one it was just like hey the education system suddenly decided that it was all backwards and wrong because this anti-family idea has been permeating our cult culture for a while so for whatever reason soros's team who is clearly attacking Matt because he had a documentary what is a woman which was a success in which he exposed what is going on with the Trans agenda he exposed what they are actually doing to children with these drugs like Lupron he exposed all of this stuff and he made an enemy of the lgbtqrs ITV agenda right the anti-family agenda and so they are after him and this was their best attempt to take him down to hear him speaking factually about the fact that our values have changed over time and questioning whether or not that's a good thing uh I don't know who needs to hear this but teenagers that get pregnant are not all being um raped which I think is the implication here they were calling him a groomer as if they were all in these relationships with 90 year old men and they're getting pregnant at 17. nope they're just they were getting pregnant by their boyfriends and then a lot of them were just getting married to that individual and going on to have more children so so if we want to you know have that debate again about whether or not Society was better when teenagers were in relationships and were committed and had children and stayed together until their dying day like my grandparents then we should have that debate but really honestly stop these pathetic attempts to distort the things that conservatives are saying because you are so hell-bent on destroying the nuclear family and that's all I have to say about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my feelings on birth control and

your husband gets you flowers your kids maybe make you breakfast mine are too young i just feel excited that i get to be in the game of mother's day it's it's there's no greater job i've said this over and over and over again nothing more important and nothing more rewarding than being a mother i want to start there because it's got me thinking about how much the intentional disappearance of mothers has contributed to virtually every societal ill that we see today when i say the intentional disappearance of mothers i'm referring to the proliferation of the modern feminist movement we know that right around 1970 the department of education came into shape and there was also this radical wave of feminism that started telling women that it wasn't just enough to have equality with men it wasn't just enough to say women can now go to work but now it was sort of this idea that it was incumbent upon women to go to work right you should want to be just like a man not just have equality but be men go to work climb the corporate ladder all of these things that i am convinced do not make a woman feel fulfilled i believe that women who fall into this trap of trying to compete with men and and be men wake up one day and they wonder where their life went because they didn't focus on these more personal elements so i want to talk about where society is and and what's really happened uh since the disappearance of mothers the education system rather than having mom overlook over your shoulder and say oh what are you studying in school you've got teachers i think that they have a right to raise your children a school student that's saying we get to decide what your kids are learning topics about gender uh telling children that they don't need to listen to their moms and dads sex ed right it's led to society becoming more promiscuous for six hours a day you're handing your children off and you're thinking oh this is going to be a good thing so i can go to work but in reality you're now sharing custody with the government and that is incredibly bizarre you know a lot of people say that conservatives are being dramatic when we say oh you know the government wants custody of your kids the government wants custody of your kids but i think now they're beginning to peek their heads up a bit and go wait a second things have gotten a little too far kovid participated in that obviously kovid made people moms and dads no matter what side of the political spectrum they were on go wait a second this is getting a little creepy this is getting a little weird you know i don't want to mask my kid well you have to i don't want to vax my kid well you have to if you want your kid to be able to go to school who's the mother you are the principal who's the mother you are the board of education well last week i received a flutter of emails you guys know that i was raised in stamford connecticut that's in fairfield county and i received a flutter of emails from parents in fairfield county telling me that they attempted to change mother's day in greenwich connecticut basically say this is old and backwards it no longer represents who we are as a community so i'm going to read you verbatim the email that went out to mothers and fathers in greenwich here it is so the title of the email is important grown-ups day and it says dear second grade families in keeping with the spirit of celebrating our diverse community of learners we have decided to shift our thinking about mother's day and father's day these holidays no longer serve who we are and rather than finding a way to fit ourselves into their boxes we have decided to make a change beginning this year the second grade students will be celebrating important grown-ups day in between mother's day and father's day they'll be provided with school time to make something special for any and all the grown-ups they believe are important in their lives we'll of course discuss some of the grown-ups that they may want to choose if you have any questions or concerns about this shift please email your child's classroom teacher directly thank you in advance for your understanding about this just that sentence there these holidays no longer serve who we are they're talking about mother's day and father's day no longer serves who we are who who who are who are we even talking about when you say who who who are i want to know were you guys talking about you think that you are the most important person in a child's life because that's what it signals it signals that this is outdated and this is backwards and it should signal to every single person especially these individuals living in fairfield county and living as a part of this greenwich school the parents that they are saying you're not required anymore they are saying the nuclear family is what is outdated and what is backwards the very concept of having a mother and a father which goes in line with what we're seeing right now you're telling kids they can pick their gender that moms and dads sitting around the dinner dinner table is backwards that it's a part of some white supremacist philosophy i mean this is true marxist ideology that's why it's so important for your your children to understand if you want to teach them anything exactly what marxist ideology is who was karl marx why did we say that they're following his doctrine well because he believed that the nuclear family had to be destroyed and the reason for that was obvious if you want the government to become omnipotent if you want the government to shape children's minds if you want children to salute the government in the morning you have to remove the pillars of faith and you also have to remove the pillar of family you should be turning to important grown-up in your life maybe that's the teacher themselves maybe that's the principle we're all just important grown-ups in your life mom and dad don't have any other significance that is what they are trying to single to these children digital eye strain from staring at our computer and our small screens all day sometimes it causes headaches sore eyes watery eyes fatigue

fortunately there's a happy ending to the story it turns out that moms and dads were pretty pissed so i received this follow-up email because this person blurred out uh who this email was written from i have to make an assumption i would assume that they all began writing to the board of education that this response came from the board of education and it says this hi parents this week we were made aware of an email that was sent to the second grade parents from greenwich's glenville school that stated that they were no longer celebrating mother's day and father's day because quote these holidays no longer serve who we are and rather than finding a way to fit ourselves into these boxes we have decided to make a change it goes on to quote that email and then the email continues this email was upsetting for many parents within 24 hours enough parents had responded to express their dissatisfaction with this change and the school ends up apologizing and reinstating the more traditional mothers special persons day and father's special persons day celebrations we would like our community of concerned parents to be aware that if the schools are making changes that make you feel uncomfortable or uneasy with please do not be afraid to voice your concerns is important that the schools we are sending our children to every day are places that we trust and feel confident in it's important that we come together we feel the schools are overreaching and taking away our parental rights thank you okay so the parents won and like i said this is a happy ending but in reality this should have never even been a situation what madness that parents had to even write to you to say that this is ridiculous that we won't we won't accept our own disappearance from your curriculum i mean what madness and what was the basis of this madness of course we understand that people can come from a different structure we can understand that there can be you know kids that live in in foster families that are attending school but to say that you're just going to disappear mothers and fathers to accommodate that and pretend that it's because you're trying to be more inclusive when in fact what you're trying to do is be more exclusive you're trying to exclude parents from children's mind all throughout the day there's no special holiday celebrating your mom and your dad we want that gone and mean just just think about the story and know that we are not being dramatic when we say that there is a war and there is a push in a pool that is taking place a a tug of war if you will a figurative tug of war that is taking place between the government and parents and if you're like me then you know that you are not willing to split custody of your kids with the government thanks

these are major conglomerates that have a lot of yields a lot of power in this country so to parents that might be watching this wondering what do i do i mean i immediately unsubscribed from disney plus i texted my husband i was like get off of disney plus we will never ever ever go to disney world but i mean that's those are the small steps we can do in one household what else can parents do i think there's really two steps to turn this into sustainable activism that might have a chance at influencing the company obviously you're completely right first off boycott disney cancel your subscription to disney plus send the communications to the disney pr team and the executives letting them know exactly what you think as a former customer but i also think that the solution to these media conglomerates that are trying to really engineer the narratives and in this case engineer kind of the narratives around children and sexuality there's a very simple recipe we have democratic power that is superior to corporate power that's how our country works that's how it's always worked and so i think what we're seeing with governor ron desantis in florida is that he's channeling maybe the spirit of teddy roosevelt he's willing to go to bat and fight these big corporations he's willing to go toe-to-toe with them he's dominating the pr battle he has between 70 and 80 of the public supporting uh the very simple language in that children's parents bill of rights and so you have to then elect people and support elected officials and politicians through the democratic system who are willing to go after these companies and in disney's case there are a number of very clear solutions disney has a massively unfair corporate tax subsidy in the state of florida disney has i think unfairly uh pressured congress to infinitely extend its copyright protections that expire next year florida legislators should take a hard look at removing special privileges economically from disney and federal legislators i think are absolutely going to stop a kind of nonsensical inspection extension of disney's intellectual property uh next year that will deal billions of dollars of damage by putting characters like mickey mouse into the public domain if you've been following along on my instagram you know that dinner time is special for me and my family i love to cook and prepare delicious meals it is therapeutic for me that being said i'm busy so anything that makes it easier for me to sit down with my husband and my little one and enjoy our meal is priceless i love good ranchers they source and sell meat that's 100 born raised and harvested in the usa it's locally sourced ships straight to your door and it's completely affordable i don't know about you but i'm not a fan of store-bought meat that's imported from overseas and only stays in business by lying about its origins or creating made-up labels like cruelty-free to ease your conscience so head on over to goodranchers.com owens or use my code owens at check out to get 30 off your order good ranchers makes gathering around the table easy once again get your box of american meat delivered at goodranchers.com owens today i like to think that in looking at this what we are actually seeing is a a radical minority that has a lot of power and is very loud um what is the advice that you give when these employees come to you because this extends beyond disney right you've got teachers that are going hey man you're asking me to now be a predator i don't want to teach this material to children this is not my job i'm just an educator i'm not a parent and yet because of these minor voices that are so radical and so loud they don't feel comfortable coming forward and so they stay into the in the inboxes of you and me and say hey this is some information that i want to pass to you what can they do because they're actually behind the lines and they're seeing the stuff take place other than leaking information they're in a very difficult position i've done dozens of these stories on critical race theory in companies and government agencies and public schools and in virtually every case people have asked to remain anonymous but i think we have a responsibility as members of the media as members of this political community to fight on their behalf even if they're remaining silent and eventually i hope we can create enough space so that the same employees at companies at k-12 schools within government agencies can can be given the latitude for them to push back within those institutions and i think what it will really take ultimately is legislation that protects employees legislation that creates guidelines k-12 public schools and that also gives these people levers of power to enforce norms to change the institutions from within so this is a public policy problem we need to start getting busy on solving it so we can empower these sane employees that represent the large majority who are unfortunately being bullied into silence and conformity you know i'm a big believer that america has um unwittingly grown soft on pedophilia there's a lot of predators that are that are roaming around we see this we just spoke about this on our panel about you know katanji brown talking about her leniency uh you know towards these certain criminals and you've certainly done a lot of covering over the years parents may have not been paying attention but disney also has a predator problem and i know that we have um some screenshots of just a few of those headlines um can you just speak to us here we got x disney cruise officer i was ordered not to report molestation i mean that's that's huge disney employees another headline disney employees registered nurse among those arrested in undercover operation targeting child predators another insane headline trial looms for disney cruise line employee accused of fondling boy aboard a ship ice it's funny that i'm reading these headlines disney workers among 16 arrested for possession of child porn polk county sheriff says it goes on and on and on i have said often that when i walk through times square and i see these people dressed up as pooh bear asking for money what a perfect job if you are a pervert to blend in and have nobody say anything to be surrounded by children and pretending that you're their favorite animal um you've sort of covered this extensively can you just speak to us about this problem yeah that's right this is a problem that unfortunately is widespread and in 2014 cnn of all places did a six-month investigative report that discovered dozens upon dozens of disney employees arrested for child sex crimes cnn said that it was a crisis it was a scandal they recommended legislation to try to allow companies like disney to take greater methods of of restricting or weeding out employees who could be child predators and so this is a pattern unfortunately every year over the past decade more and more disney employees are arrested for these child sex crimes and i think it's relevant because of this i think it's relevant because disney is presenting itself as a moral voice on children and sexuality um but meanwhile in its own record it has this really horrific pattern that doesn't seem to be abating they haven't done enough to stop it and so when they enter politics on those terms they will be scrutinized in politics on those terms and so this is a problem you know it's not a conspiracy theory it's not q anon that's what the left is saying now if you just look at the history of cnn they've reported on this problem for years and now they're trying to avoid it or cover it up because it's politically inconvenient but if your interest is protecting kids from any institution unfortunately from the catholic church from the public school system from children's theme parks we have to do more it's a significant problem the data from the department of education for example suggests that millions of kids are sexually abused uh it's an absolutely horrific scandal we need to do more you are correctly you are so correct in that and i i couldn't be more firm on that i always say to parents this is the hill to die on you're talking about your children and i do believe honestly that in this country we are facing a pandemic of pedophilia that nobody wants to talk about thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new

crime I'll give you a hint the answer is actually yes and I've just realized it plus a 22 year old woman has opted to get her Fallopian tubes extracted from her body not just that she then turned them into a piece of jewelry to tether around her neck because she's just so proud of the fact that she does not want children all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] thank you so I asked the question am I also contributing to black on black crime in our society and I'll tell you why I asked the question I received a comment on a recent episode in which I stood up for Kyrie Irving and I talked about this spiritual desire that I feel that I must stand by black men in this moment in time and a woman comments on it a black woman commented on this episode and she said as a black woman in society I wish that she would be this positive about other black women in society the message it sends is that only black men who are well known for disrespecting black women are deserving of loyalty and protection this comment was from Ms HW and when I saw it I have to first say that I kind of saddened me a little bit like I felt I had to really sit there and consider that comment a lot I thought to myself am I actually sending out a signal that black women don't matter which is obviously very ironic because I am a black woman and I really started to think about all of my past commentary I do comment on not just on black women but women in general wider I actually said like how many times do I use my platform to defend women and it was kind of hard to me to come up with many examples I mean obviously I did defend Nicki Minaj when she was speaking out against not wanting to get the vaccines and the whole media came down and crushed her and I felt like that was not just but in general when I Do cover women I am harsh in my critiques I often cover Madonna I could cover Emily rojakowski and the reason I go after them is because I do believe that these women for example cardi B are contributing to the corrosion of society and so this commenter is correct to feel that I am neglecting really all women in my lot of my analyzes and I don't use enough of my platform to talk about women that are providing good examples and I think that there's an element that I guess really about our culture that is so disturbing to me and that I feel that the only way that our culture is going to get back on track is for women to stop believing that they need to rinse themselves of their Womanhood and their femininity so that's one element of it the other thing is that women in general aren't very nice each other it's not just Candace it's it's women in general are just not that nice to each other I always say the movie Mean Girls is kind of real life you know what I'm saying and a part of this is biological there's an underpinning of biology I've often spoke about a book that I read which was written by an author named E.O Wilson who is a biologist and uh who basically underpins he has this thesis that everything that we do in society and the way that we behave in society you really just have to examine our biology and you can look to examples in the wild to fully understand why we behave in that manner right so why are women a bit cattier with one another than men are right men are kind of they hang out they're totally fine but women are a bit more competitive and a bit more catty and the argument that he puts forth in this book is that well women have to compete and they have to compete for men and by if you speak about our biology women have 400 eggs that's it we are born with all the eggs we're ever going to have so our body is telling us to compete with other women to find another man to start a family man on the other hand can produce as much seed until they're 90 and they are that therefore trying to increase their numbers and increase their pack size so again biology is what's underpinning a lot of our action but it's not just that and I do agree that that is quite legitimate there is also a I guess I would say almost a social contract that I feel that we women have with one another where we want to make other women in our image as opposed to just accepting them for who they are and I spoke a lot about this particularly as it pertains to black women especially that it was very difficult for me growing up I had all these black friends in elementary school then we had to take the state tests which would decide what classes we were in in middle school and because I performed well on these State tests my classroom had no black people in it so obviously you make friends with Weber's in your classroom and there was something about me being in a higher classroom right by IQ standards that made these women really resent me and they were mean to me I mean I was in Middle School very much bullied by black women for no reason I never had any drama never said anything to them but I always talked about I talked about this frequently in the past but also in my book I described how for being smart there was like a crime for being smart and there was this one girl who used to always kind of like bump my shoulder every time she saw me into the hallway intentionally she'd come all the way across the hallway and she's going to bump my shoulder just to be mean they should say like this isn't cool and then there was another girl who I spoke about in my book who I was very much into the Harry Potter books still am I think they're awesome books and they were this is when they were dropping them all we were waiting in line trying to get our hands on the next book and I was racing home to read the Harry Potter novel and I've spoken about how this girl sort of made fun of me in the lunchroom and I thought she was like the most amazing I thought she was so pretty I wanted to be friends with this girl her name was Sheena and how she called me over to the lunch table in front of this whole table of black girls that were in her classroom made fun of me for not knowing the lyrics to a rap song and so I think it's really interesting I consider this comment and I considered my relationship with black women over the years of my schooling and I realized that much of that behavior of not liking me because of this invisible social contract Candace does not act black enough Candace speaks proper English Candace I don't know likes books and isn't partaking enough in in hip-hop culture it still exists right I constantly am feeling that I'm still getting bumped in the shoulder in the hallways because I'm just being who I am this is actually who I am there's no one that I'm trying to be this whole she's acting white she wants to be white no and I think it's a sad commentary uh that black women feel that way that black woman feel that they have to exist within a prototype to be black that to me feels like a form of slavery it feels like you're restricting yourselves and I think in further consideration of this that black women are almost the most responsive to culture right constantly trying to do whatever is cool and is acceptable and that black men are maybe establishing Trends whereas black women are kind of responding all the time to the trends that are being established it sort of creates this toxic relationship between black men and between black women and black women are trying to empower themselves in ways that don't act really make them feel powerful and one of these ways is they've sort of accepted this narrative that men are trash and I vehemently disagree with this narrative that meant our trash I would be able to agree that and I understand that we have a culture where we kind of put a pedestal on men that don't act well and we also Place uh put women on a pedestal and when they don't act well that's why I often talk about Madonna and cardi B different races but the same idea but I do believe that black women are not being true to who they are right and I can see this even in the pettiness in the comments when they are if I'm saying something and it makes sense there's always this really Petty response like oh well I'm not going to listen to her because she looks like this or her hair looks like this or blah blah blah it's always a commentary on how I look and not actually the words that I'm saying again trying to tell me that I need to be in your image in order for us to be friends so I had this thought in my head reading this comment for a couple of days and as I said it made me very sad because I don't want people to feel that I don't see them or that I don't hear that hurt I do hear that hurt I do actually believe that black women are the most hurt in this Society for a lot of reasons a lot of it stems from government policies in the 60s and a lot of you know the single motherhood rate and feeling left alone constantly being left alone and having that loneliness reinforced by bad incentivizations from the government and I was having this conversation yesterday with Dr Ben Carson who is somebody that I very much admire here and somebody that I wrote about in my book and I was on his podcast and I was talking to him about my brexit movement and my brexit charity and the work that we're doing in these inner cities and how much these kids uh mean to me that we get to provide them with just opportunities to be something else right to say actually it's pretty cool if you like to read Harry Potter it's pretty cool if you like to read books you don't have to just exist under the weight of what culture is telling you to be today and in response to me saying that I wanted to sort of bring black people back together this is what Dr Ben Carson said to me take a listen but you're very courageous and very articulate and uh Express that very well but it there's also always been a tendency to try to keep the black community divided uh and that started all the way back in the times of slavery when the particularly the slave owners in places like Mississippi and Alabama were very concerned because there were actually more slaves than there were honors and they appeared an uprising so they would tell the slaves in the house that they were better than the ones in the yard the ones in the yard they were better than the ones in the field and keep this internal turmoil going all the time and then after slavery the light-skinned ones are better than the medium skin ones you're better than the dark skinned ones and there's always been a way to keep them divided and of course now they want to make sure that conservative blacks and liberal blacks don't combine forces so they try to create tension and hatred there as well and uh you know I think some of the things that you're doing are really helping to alleviate some of that tension so I appreciate it but what about black lives matters uh what's your diagnosis there I respond to what you just said because it was the exact words I needed to hear this week and I've spent this entire week defending Kyrie Irving and defending my friendship with yay and there's been this media peer pressure for me to dump Kanye West because I'm better than him and he's made a mistake and this media peer pressure for black Americans to speak out and to say something wrong about Kyrie Irving and I have felt over the last month very spiritually conflicted because there are so many people telling me that this is what I should do right these people are bad but then there's a party that's going no this has gone on for too long you keep telling black people not to support each other right I want to create an ecosystem where we can support black people when they're wrong and we can support black people when they're right and that we can just support one another full stop and that is actually how I feel and to hear him put it to learned behavior from slavery just hit me in my soul right the idea that you can't like Candace Owens you're not supposed to like cancer there's this concept of she's a they always call me on Instagram actually a lot of black women were oh she's she's a house negro who taught you that why are you saying that do you actually believe that I think that I'm better than you right why do we do this because we've learned this behavior and just like Dr Ben Carson says there is somebody that knows that all of us coming together there is a society that understands that we would be too powerful if we all came together I don't want to contribute in that slave economy anymore I do not feel and if you need to hear it that in any way I am better than you I am not better than you because I like politics and I like to pay attention to politics and you maybe like to pay attention to culture and you know more about culture that doesn't make you better than me because you might be able to name more of the top hip-hop songs we're different people we need to accept that we are different people and figure out how we can come together despite being perfect people being different people I don't want to have to be someone that I am not to be your friend and I hope that what is happening now and I do feel it uh that we are beginning to have these conversations and we are beginning to understand that we would be way more powerful as allies and I hope that what you take from my commentary because there was a lot of it and I know that the media intentionally portrays it as though I'm always just talking back about Black Americans that could not be further from the truth but I have been trying to communicate to Black America and to all of America is that we can do better than what we're doing we can do better we can be better beings we can strive towards better right and I've realized that that message represents a threat to people I don't know why that is but I do know that it needs to end and that we all need to stop participating in this slave economy and that's all I want to say about that okay guys I want to take a moment

first up let's talk about Nicki Minaj speaking of women and women empowerment she has recently given an interview and admitted that she wants to be a role model for black women and give them confidence due to their lack of representation in the music industry she's 39 years old and she spoke about how she always felt that she was not good enough growing up because she didn't see black women on the covers of magazines she also said that she wants to empower young girls to believe that they don't need a guy for anything and she did this by the way speaking to ID magazine while fronting their winter 2022 issue I definitely want to pause there because I think that kind of goes in line with uh the Nuance of what I'm trying to say I think it's great that Nicki Minaj wants to show people that they should be confident and show women that they can do whatever they want but I don't quite understand why it always has to come at the denigration of men like I don't understand that they don't need a guy for anything it's like you do need a guy for something you do actually I believe that men and marriage and relationships are aspirational and that men make women better people and women make men better people I can say that since becoming married I have become a better person and my husband has become a better person and I think women calm men right and I almost want to say that we focus men in the way they need to be focused and Men calm women in that it's very easy for women to become Petty and too obsess about things that don't really matter and Men kind of give us the clearer and the bigger picture they calm women down and so I do realize I think that this is one of the bad elements of feminism is that it kind of teaches you that in order to empower women you have to say something about how they don't need a man and I don't agree with that but there are elements of this interview that I do agree with she goes on to say that there's always been a lack of representation for black women as soon as you start becoming famous you owe it to the entire culture to say things that other black women can repeat to make themselves feel great she told the publication that probably speaks to the black women that feel like I don't represent them or I don't give them a voice is because usually when I'm talking about black women I'm saying that we need to do better and so I'm coming in as kind of the harsh parent here and saying that we used to have a wonderful culture of black women that should have been celebrated when you talk about the old music when you talk about Soul there was something that was so wonderful and glamor immersed and aspirational and I feel truly that it has just completely disintegrated over the years and I don't I don't know how we go from Patti LaBelle to cardi B and that's another topic and I don't want people to feel offended by that topic I actually want people to consider it and and to realize that the larger question that I always have is who said that this is Black Culture you know what I mean I I feel like we keep being told this is our culture but actually this is not our culture at all this has been intentionally created for us and I try to speak on that in a harsh way but maybe I need to be a little bit more compassionate in saying that and I hope that that is as compassionate as I can possibly be in saying it Nikki went on to say that hearing young women saying her lyrics makes her want to give them confidence and help them realize they can do whatever they want to do she also addressed misconceptions around her personality because she's outspoken saying that she feels it is important to speak out in issues that matter to her you know Nicki Minaj notoriously got in tons of trouble as I mentioned in my monologue because she spoke up against the vaccines and said to people don't do something with your body that you're not comfortable with doing she also spoke about a vaccine reaction that somebody that she knew had and the Press tried to make it seem like she was crazy and that she was a liar because everyone got in line with this narrative and she stood by her guns and I respect Nicki Minaj for that I respect her for actually going against the Hollywood web because they feel like I say there is a Hollywood mafia they feel like once they allow you to have a platform that you have to get in line with all of their narratives whether that be BLM whether that be LBGTQ RS issues whether that be the vaccine and the second a celebrity gets an idea of wandering off of that Hollywood Plantation it can be pretty severe the punishment can be pretty severe uh Nikki admitted that she has suppressed some of her beliefs over the year due to having reservations and being fearful of losing her job wow that seems to be a common theme amongst artists amongst black Americans right now that we feel that we have to be careful in how we speak because there's some control and there's some money and there's some bottom line that says that this is what you're allowed to say this is what you're not allowed to say and that's not right we live in a country where we have free speech of course Free Speech does come with consequences but it hurts me to hear that so many people are feeling this way and I know that it must be felt tenfold in Hollywood where that media Mafia is running rampant however she has decided that she is now not going to give an S anymore and speak out on issues that matter to her because she has realized her fans will still support her and that is what really matters that is where I draw my confidence from I know that people understand that I'm committed to truth first and foremost and I said to someone the other day that at the moment that I stop being allowed to tell the truth I've lost the plot at the moment that I've decided that there is a check that is too big for you to tell the truth anymore I've sold my soul and so it's important that everyone understands that whether you're in the NBA and you're Kyrie Irving uh whether you're you know having a show like I do or have shows that I have had in the past it's all great it's an amazing opportunity to be able to share my voice and to be able to share my thoughts but if anything ever changed all of us would have to simultaneously understand that this country values Freedom if we're not acting free in our own personal capacity then it's incredibly hypocritical for us to yell and scream about freedoms on our various platforms moving on guys um in a topic and speaking about lgbtq issues being one of the lines that has to be towed in Hollywood recently the first biological mail was announced the winner of Miss greater Dairy which is a beauty pageant that is held by the Miss America organization so this individual goes by the name Brienne and he's become the first transgender to win the title under the Miss America organization he was named the Miss grader Dairy of 2023 which landed him a crown and a scholarship and it was announced this past Sunday now the Miss greater Dairy scholarship program provides scholarships to quote unquote young women between the ages of 17 and 24. now of course every woman should be upset with this because this is quite literally the Erasure of women right it is saying that if a man jumps into a caricature of what it means to be a woman puts on some lipstick and a wig and starts talking in the way that he thinks women talk basically puts on a performance that he should be receiving priority over actual women who are having women experiences throughout their entire life we've been pretending that somehow a man's fetishes mean more than our actual existence I can't think of anything that could be more misogynist than that right and I have said this over and over again when I see a man that says that he's a woman and he's got fake boobs and he talks like a valley girl and he's got a wig on and makeup I feel mocked I feel laughed at especially when they're being over the top as that Tick Tock or a Dylan Mulvaney has been and I'm afraid of bugs and screaming and things of that nature it's a mockery you're looking at women in the face and you're saying there's nothing special about you I can put on aforemention just like you are putting on a performance there's nothing real about you there's nothing substant about you I can be you and now that we've gotten to a place in society where we don't recognize the wrongness and that and we penalize women who speak out and say I don't like that right why I am called a transphobe for saying that rather than calling that man pretending to be me a misogynist you punish me for saying it that is a very scary space to be in in society when people can no longer tell a difference between a lie and the truth and it begins to yell at the truth and tell the truth that it needs to shut up we should not shut up and I'm glad to see that the reactions on social media were mixed and that some women really believe that the win is a reflection of internalized misogyny and one tweet as an example somebody wrote you all know how the left likes to talk about internalized misogyny this is what it actually looks like I could not agree more of that statement how much does a woman have to hate herself that she pretends that a man pretending to be her is more worthy of love and acceptance just makes entirely no sense to me and here is a video by the way of Brienne winning [Music] can we skip to the good part [Music] so there you have it a scholarship opportunity taken away from other women who are all standing next to applauding pretending that they think that this is fair it's obviously not fair at all for a man to take an opportunity from a woman especially when this opportunity was carved out to be specifically for women but that is where rat and our society Up Is Down and Down is up all right guys I want to take a moment to talk to you

Candace speaking of this responsibility that women have in society and I always say that it's going to be up to us to get Society back on its tracks that's why I'm often speaking about the extreme things that women are doing and for whatever reason it seems that social media is a special place where women compete to be more and more extreme in their actions for attention so it started with women saying okay I'm on social media and I want attention then it said I'm on social media and to get attention I'm going to take all my clothes off okay I'm on social media and to get attention it's not enough for me to just take my clothes off I'm also going to start getting procedures online right we talked about your psychological immune system in previous episodes being broken down because of social media because it tells you that you need to be more and more extreme and because you're becoming more extreme because you're trying to find a community and so I spoke to you about these women that now just go on Instagram and cry they literally just they cry as soon as they have a feeling they go and they cry and they're doing that because they want likes right there's this dopamine hit you're getting a like and you're being extreme you're being extremely unstable and so you cry and so social media is encouraging the psychological breakdown and it's encouraging you to want to be more extreme so that another community of people can find you and go wow she's so brave look she's not just on social media she's not just naked on social media but she's naked and she's crying and like like like like what can I do to be even more extreme than that incredibly Brave cave woman well Savannah blew in was a 22 year old woman heard the call and she is here to answer it how can you be more extreme on social media what about saying I don't want kids now you might be thinking that's not that that's not that true who cares there's a whole community of people on Reddit who don't want kids yeah but Savannah's figured out a way to get attention from that she has decided to get a surgery to have her Fallopian tubes extracted from her body still not enough you're thinking yeah people get their tubes tied okay but do people ask to take their Fallopian tubes home and turn them into a piece of jewelry yeah because that is what Savannah has done it not only has Savannah blue and done this but she is obviously documenting that she created a necklace out of her tubes saying that the creation makes her feel empowered oh wow she said quote I had my Fallopian tubes removed because I've always known that I never want to have children the vegan restaurant waitress felt inspired to make a necklace following the decision to overturn the court case Roe v Wade talk about an absolute Psychopathic response to overturning a Supreme Court case and simply saying that all most beautiful abortion by sending it back down to the States and this woman is so distraught that she decides that the best way to respond to this legal matter is to have our Fallopian tubes removed and to be put in to jewelry and to speak out and talk about that on tick tock so yeah she's from Connecticut which is where I'm from and I'm very embarrassed she's from Connecticut and she posted a video on her Tick Tock that has since gone viral take a listen so a lot of people said this and a lot of people also grouped together and said a couple other things and those couple other things where they're going to mold in the resin you should have sent them to pathology so you know if you're gonna get sick and three is how do I get so lucky so I am going to use you uh to Lovato uh to answer those questions so yeah they are a little I was expecting them to be bigger as well because I had Googled it and it said it was gonna be four inches each uh and they are not so I don't know if it's because they're no longer hydrated and they got a little scrunchy um I know they shrunk a tiny bit because I put them in the refrigerator for one night um so maybe they were bigger when they came out but yeah they're they're pretty tiny um the other thing was that people wanted to make sure that I sent them to pathology I did I got them back from pathology that's how I got them um so what I did is I asked my surgeon if I could keep them she said probably not and I said I want to make them to jewelry and she was like oh I'll ask pathology that sounds sick and so she had asked and they had originally said no but I didn't even know that um because before I got an answer back I had already written a letter and sent it to them that said um essentially I looked at the laws in my state and I know exactly where my rights begin and end regarding this I am tremendously lucky to have been able to get the surgery um I don't deny that one bit I am 22 years old and I happen to live in Connecticut which is a very safe state for women right now um I'm really lucky in that sense but regarding the getting the tubes back um that was just because I was self-advocating and I did my research and I was you know I was very determined about it and most of the time if you say you know I'm well aware of my rights I've already done the research they're not going to want to deal with you I don't have the money to sue anybody but I mean it sounds like I did so that's how I got them back so if anyone has any other questions feel free to come in and ask and I'll make a video or if you want to look at my Instagram I documented the entire process of my surgery if you're looking to get this done so my Instagram is salve blue and I'm going to put it on my hand right here um so there it's a public account and the Highlight is called No tubes no problem and all the information that I have essentially was on there but if you still have questions you can DM me if you'd like also if you look at that highlight you'll see a picture of the letter that I wrote to pathology if you want a template to threaten your local Pathology Department also I almost didn't say The Moldy thing um if they're going to get moldy they're going to get moldy they're already in resin I can't do anything so there you have it if you think it is dramatic to say that we are living in the times of Satan then I urge you to rewind this podcast and listen to that again just listen to her casually speaking on Tick Tock a 22 year old girl about how she just ruined her life she just just to sex she just sacrificed her body literally to a narrative right they told her the world was over and she wasn't going to be able to get an abortion and kill her own kids so what did she do she removed her Fallopian tubes that is how committed she is to the ideology that is how she is committed to The Cult of the left right she's literally sacrificing her own body and she's so willing to do it that she jumped on Tick Tock documented it and to encourage others to do it and then you would think okay well at least the people seeing this will tell her that she's crazy and satanic but if that's what you're thinking you're wrong you're absolutely wrong the comments are favorable Alyssa writes to her why did you have the surgery surgery was just a personal choice super cool that you kept them oh really oh okay Artemis writes hey State neighbor Alex writes the fact that you have to ask to keep a part of you like the fact that she even had to write a letter to request her Fallopian tubes back that is what has Artemis shook not the fact that she literally had her Fallopian tubes removed for a narrative she's not she's she's just like I don't even want to think about having children I'm 22 years old forget the fact that my brain is not even fully developed forget the fact that I have no idea how I'm going to feel if I meet somebody and fall in love I did this because I don't know the media told me that I should be enraged that the world was over and so I did it I was brainwashed where this person's parents are I don't know I literally don't know where this girl's parents are but these are how the comments are Serena same thing what I find insane is that they could tell you know it all like they effing belong to you they're your fallopian tubes they were inside of you nobody else should have a say which I guess makes sense because these people are basically saying that that is why you have right to kill a baby anything that's inside of you you have a right to kill and you know what there are the fact that they wouldn't give back to her is a problem she this psychopath probably thinks he should be able to request an abortion and then get the baby back right after you abort it this is how sick and demented this world has become I tell you on the show all the time to keep your kids off of tick tock it is so obvious to me that Tick Tock is driving our society into a very very very dark place and it is just not worth it to have this chatter if you're a child reading this and you're thinking oh this is normal this is totally normal all the comments are supporting this girl like this guy this is so cool thousands of years from now geologists will discover your fallopian tubes preserved like dragonflies in Amber that's a real comment that is a real comment under the fact that this girl just mutilated her own body I I am I just I'm so disgusted I have to stop talking about this because it's going to make me angry and I am practicing happiness on this Friday but I'm not going to find it in this next story because the next story is about Pfizer and there's nothing good that comes out of Pfizer certainly not a vaccine but they have one coming at anyways I've been telling you guys you know I am as they call me anti-vaxx it is true I do not believe in vaccines I'm very well researched on it I'm not telling you what to do with your own body I am just telling you that if you have an inkling that something seems up that they just keep adding and adding and adding to back the vaccine schedule that when we were kids we got 12 and now the kids are getting 74 before they leave High School do your research that's all I'm saying do your research and do not allow yourself to be bullied by stupid names and smears like anti-vaxxer okay well it's not enough that they're giving your kids about 74 vaccines from a time that they're born until they're 18 and off to college now they keep trying to front end the vaccines because vaccines equal money so they keep coming up with vaccines more and more and more to give women while they're pregnant right when you're pregnant they're like well this will protect your child from from getting sick like the Tdap one that they gave to women but of course they give your child a Tdap shot you know a couple of months after they're born but they tell you that you also need to get it to protect them from pertussis I've had two pregnancies I've never gotten any vaccines while I'm pregnant guess I'm just one of the lucky ones or whatever well Pfizer is now going to add more to the pre-birth schedule they have developed a vaccine for RSV you know kids do get RSV a lot of questions about differences between whooping cough and RSV and all of these cloths that kids get because as I have said in other podcasts my sister told me that when her kid who did get RSV and he was very sick from it and he is fully vaccined on schedule when she asks them to test for whooping cough they wouldn't because he was backs and they said well it must be RSV okay well that doesn't seem like a good system of telling a difference between the two but they wouldn't even test them for it so and he had it for way longer than a couple of days or a couple of weeks he had it for an entire uh two months which makes me think it was whooping cough which is called also colloquially the 100-day cough but they told her no no no no no this is RSV so now there's a vaccine for RSV for pregnant women to immune to immunize their unborn babies while they are in the womb and of course Pfizer was developing it given specifically to pregnant women and they claim that the infants will then be protected against a respiratory virus RSV after birth according to the CDC RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild cold-like symptoms most people recover in a week or two but RSV can be serious especially for infants and older adults it is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than one year of age in the United States so that is coming to a market near me you of course what the studies show nobody's going to know because they're going to do a huge fear campaign they're going to tell you that your kid's going to die if you don't get the vaccine the pre-vaccine the vaccine to the vaccine that they're going to probably then tell you kids have to all get it no matter what they do the idea is that every single person adult and child should get whatever vaccine they produce that increases their profits it's why that they they migrate vaccines too they tell you that it does one thing and then suddenly wait a few months and they tell you that the vaccine does something else Gardasil is probably the greatest example of this Garden so was the vaccine that I got injured by and why I woke up to the whole vaccine thing um and I could say a scam because they just are constantly telling us that it means something else Gardasil they told us was going to protect us from cervical cancer it was four women Four Women for women well nowadays they say it's for everybody actually it's now also for men and men Advocate now it's also for kids and now they're trying to get Gardasil for children that are in daycare they actually tried to pass a law that in order to go into daycare you'd have to get the Gardasil shot so so much for women in cervical cancer now it's boy boys and girls including in daycare and if you have questions about that that would make you a conspiracy theorist and an anti-baxter and I don't want you to be either of those things why should you have to be I'm that so you shouldn't be that too that's all guys that's all I have to say about all that we all know that the mainstream media loves to glorify obesity and unhealthy Lifestyles under the guise of body positivity this is a very radical and dangerous misperception of reality and in case you have been fooled let me be clear being overweight is not in fact healthy that said living a healthy lifestyle is not easy it's hard to get up and go for a run every morning it's hard to make sure you're getting the proper nourishment especially when you're running from work to school to practice to wherever else you need to go during your busy schedule that is where balance of nature

for me I hope you're being nice today first up somebody is commenting regarding the video we showed of AOC apologizing for not having her pronouns in her Instagram bio when she apologized remember she said oh I don't know what happened they just fell off they just fell off into a puddle this person comments and says I'm not even American but I can tell you that all America's current issues started when Obama became president yes it was probably the coolest U.S president but all of this stuff started with him he gave the woke movement a voice he had them he gave them a start and let's say gave them a start and now the only way to stop it is to go Republican don't make the same mistake South Africa has made USA will go all the way down if that is not checked just an opinion from an outsider looking in I think it's just the right opinion I said that I remember the night Obama won and I was a liberal and I cried in my dorm and I was like oh this is amazing Obama won yes we can yes we can move on from racist narratives and we're all going to come together and just bleed red white and blue and no we did not now we all are each other's throats all the time we started leaning into the BLM narrative towards the end of his presidency he started talking about what black men are going through and and suddenly began separating us so it is ironic that this person that was pitched to us as someone that was going to bring the nation together actually brought about so much destruction and I think at the end of the day it's because Barack Obama is a Marxist and that is the truth next question is regarding the Harvey Weinstein and Jennifer Newsome Jennifer Newsom reminding you guys is Gavin newsom's wife and she was one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers and Harvey Weinstein's defense from a very good defense saying that okay if I raped this woman can anybody explain to me why she would bring her husband around my house after that of host parties and she would come in attendance is that a normal thing for somebody to do after they've been raped um this person comments LaQuinta life and says I would see her at events all the time she was working it for sure to get parts like most of us reminding you that before she married Gavin Newsom she was an aspiring actress which is what uh Harvey Weinstein's defense also said this person continues I met Harvey at can with a group of my friends I was repulsed I called my husband and said he looks like the devil he hit on one of my friends instead of a meeting with her the next day at his hotel and skyroad like Hotel meetings she had me come with her for support I went and sat in the hotel restaurant he met us and had his assistant take her up to his hotel rooms I I was content to stay put and eat as I was hungover however the funny thing was that after my friend left with his assistant Harvey wanted back into the restaurant where I was sitting and sort of walked around my table as if he was wanting me to engage with him it was like he assumed that I too would do anything to connect with him there was no way I was remotely interested in so after several minutes of me ignoring him he left but many many women willfully jumped at the chance to meet him and went to his hotel room I am sure my friend met with him and came back down she said he hit on her but she did not as far as she told me sleep with him they did flirt and he gave her his number and this was right after he married Regina Chapman she was at the Cannes Film Festival with him I was shocked and disappointed to realize that Hollywood really was full of this BS that is true Hollywood is among other things a prostitution ring obviously people are prostituting themselves for the parts there have been countless examples of that and I do think that a lot of people are regretting their behavior and that pretending that they were not willing participants in their behavior becomes a way to rent themselves of any guilt again some examples of that not all of them obviously they're already back to examples of women that are actually raped but when people when some women are not raped and pretend that they're raped because they want it apart it significantly harms actual rape victims all right guys that is all in regards to the comments you know the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you are not a member yet go ahead click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "r-KQ-R6ExiE": "welcome back as i mentioned in my monologue today foreign policy is a passion of mine and now i want to be a passion of yours too the sad truth is that most americans have no idea what is going on overseas much less how it affects us in our country which is why i am so excited to launch this new segment foreign affairs with candace imposo with my good friend and veteran veteran navy intel officer jack posobik all right so much to get into i kind of want to start with i kind of this monologue talking about gaddafi um and first and foremost i was just blown away by his un speech but also because the ending of that obviously he gets sodomized on video shots you know the the nato hit his convoy they said it was an accident and that video footage of him being sodomized uh was passed around the world particularly putin and this was at the u.s ambassador at the time said that particularly putin was really struck by this and he watched this video multiple times and it really colored putin's perspective i think even further about what nato is and what a threat is he's like if this is a democracy this is supposed to be civilized if you guys are supposed to be preventing wars in the world right this is why we established nato after world war ii we wanted to make sure that there was a security force to stop wars and now you're hitting a convoy of a un nation country i mean i'm sorry of a united nations member country and look at how he's being slaughtered this is completely uncivilized this fast forwards us to today right now we're hearing all this talk about ukraine and russia and the general verbiage that's coming from at least the american narrative is like the soviet union's coming back putin's a threat what is your take on this well i think you're absolutely right that it's certainly the way the kremlin views things and the way they look at it is they see this as part and parcel of just a long chain a series of u.s led regime changes around the world so we don't even have to go back to the 50s and 60s what was done in south america latin america done in iran in the 1950s you can just look at what's going on in the past decade or so so yeah of course libya happened a few years before that was iraq right before that was afghanistan then what afghanistan obviously back in this just five months ago fell again to the taliban then you saw syria where syria for years had these quote unquote moderate rebels that were popped up you know because i guess we're going through to the various terrorist bans and deciding that you guys are good so we'll give you money but you guys are bad so we're going to fight you but don't give guns to the hey wait stop giving those guys the guns that we just gave you it's it's ridiculous but they attempted to do this regime change in syria as well then ukraine in 2013 2014 when the maidan protests kicked off right they were supported by u.s elements money was given to them and this is you know this has all been broken down joe biden of course is on video talking about this victoria newland was caught on a leaked call talk essentially talking about how she was choosing the new ministers for ukraine's government when their democratically elected president was overthrown in ukraine and had to flee the country and then the u.s started which is why it's so funny to me that the u.s and the uk are putting out this speech or this you know we have intel that russia is trying to install a puppet government no you literally did that in the u.s to ukraine just a few years ago you did that not them and this seems to be a repeat playbook in terms of america we say oh we're here uh because we need to establish some democracy there's some civil issues going on we somehow back the rebels people get overthrown and we establish the person that we want in power at the time and it always seems advantageous to america and we tend not to ask questions i mean i remember kind of trying to figure out like actually after 9 11 why were we why was there a war in iraq the saudis committed 9 11. why was there a war in afghanistan none of it really made any sense and they sort of rely on ignorance right on americans not being able to sort of discern it seems so messy the middle east is always conflict in the middle east we don't really know what's going on in the eastern corridor and so we let it go and we go okay we're just going to focus on american issues um that's becoming a problem right so i want to first pull up a map of nato right this is a military alliance um uh really the uk and america has the most control over this military alliance um look at how expansive this is right so you are looking at everywhere that the that nato has boots on the ground just look at this map if you're at home and try to kind of reprocess that right now the narrative is that russia is the problem that putin wants to expand his global influence you should also know that russia has a smaller gdp than california help me out here i mean how do you say this with a straight face well so the way it works is this if you're in america you say well nato is the good guys because we're nato and so to us everyone should be a member of nato because this is north atlantic treaty organization we were set up to fight the soviet union and we will defend the free world against the soviet union of course the problem then becomes that there is no soviet union anymore right and so nato's original mission you know has kind of been achieved and so what's the point of nato well if you go back to the original commander of nato who was a major uh british major back in the 1950s he said they asked him what was the point of nato and he said it very clearly and they won't talk like this anymore but back then they said it was obvious he said the point of nato is to keep the americans in the russians out and the germans down right that's the point of nato right so if we can look back at that map can you give us an assessment of why it is that nato suddenly and and they've been trying this for a while why is it that they want to expand into ukraine well so moving nato into ukraine achieves a lot of purposes and uh keep in mind it's not just about bringing military forces into ukraine it's about economic forces it's about bringing ukraine and really eventually all of that part of central europe into uh the central economic financial system with the rest of the eu and the united states in on board so you have to pair those commercial interests along with the military interests and so essentially they want it to be a situation where everyone's completely pro united states completely pro this nato access and so if they can get more countries in because then you get more consumption you get more production um that's all tied into one basic system so this is kind of the sort of that one world state you know that was originally the idea of the united nations was that you'd have these various states and qaddafi talked about this that why can't we just have trading blocks the eu the african union the americans and we all work in peace and we have economic relations but we're not all under one giant system like that right saw what happened in gaddafi right exactly and so what we're really looking at is when we talk about globalism this is this is an expansion and i don't understand and first i want to be very clear no one is saying putin is a good guy no one is saying putin is an amazing person i don't want to elect putin as president united states right obviously to me his ambitions have been very clear from the very beginning he wants to be the president of russia for 400 years after he dies like that is it like that he wants everything to do with russia um and he's done a lot of things to accomplish that and that might come true in 400 years we still might be saying president putin somehow um but it's it's it's interesting to work with elon musk and get the exactly and get the neural links yeah yeah but what's interesting to me is that they always paint this as him being the aggressor and this kind of even takes you back to the the cold war people kind of still have this cold war mentality and understanding of russia when very few people i talked about this on my last episode even understand that during the cold war america's worthy aggressor we once again put we put missiles on the border of russia and in response they put missiles in cuba right and and cuba was happy to let them do it because cuba was upset that we had a failed operation um the bay of pigs operation on the cuban border and basically saying what do you guys think you're doing you can't just put misses on someone's border if this was was flipped if the script was flipped and russia by the way bay of pigs another regime change operation that was yeah exactly too and we basically say well we're liberating people and we can go in there and we can do this and these people go who gives you the authority you know if people decide you know to live in a certain way or live in a certain country who gives you the authority to keep going and overthrowing you know various elements of governments but so you look at this and you say okay could you imagine if this this script was flipped could you imagine if right now russia had garnered that much power across europe and then was trying to put missiles in mexico and in canada well this is you know you don't even have to imagine it go back to world war one this is the zimmerman telegram this was the plan of the british or the german powers in world war one they send that telegram to mexico and say invade the united states join with the access because we're worried that the u.s is going to come into the war on the side of the uk on the side of the allies so we want you to go in and invade the united states immediately so you're going to have that problem you'll have to deal with them you'll be on our side right so whether or not we you know nato actually believes itself to be that kind of aggressor force the key is that's how the kremlin sees it that's how putin sees it and that is how by if you look at russian military doctrine they're generals they're the leaders of their army the russian duma this is exactly how they are trained to think nato is because i mean look at the actual charter documents nato is an explicitly anti-russia military alliance right that's exactly right and americans need to understand this because it seems this administration wants us to plunge to plunge us um in a war with in ukraine you know they obviously really care about this issue they're not talking about china the most obvious that we actually face you know a country that that is also rapidly expanding their global influence um a country that has been hostile to americans you know culture that's completely different from ours and yet the reason for that is very clear as well because we know that ukraine is of interest to the biden family because of hunter biden because of barisma because of all of these things that they failed to talk about when biden was running biden got 50 000 reasons a month to care about ukraine this is the family business and for some reason we're not allowed to talk about it we get fact checked when we talk about it well guess what we know the truth i've got a copy by the way of hunter biden's laptop and i've got a candace would you like a copy i would love a copy should i give candace a copy of the laptop of hunter biden we're going to do it we're going to do it we're going to do it we're going to give you the copy this is such a great discussion and we will get right back into it after this quick message i've said this before but my favorite part of each day is sitting around the dinner table with my family you make it a priority to put our phones away and have meaningful conversations and a quality meal but if you're like me life is busy and convenience is key that's where good ranchers come in good rancher sends 100 american meat from local farms straight to your door it's all individually wrapped and vacuum sealed which makes it quick and easy to cook their meat is high quality ethically raised and sustainably sourced and the chicken-based source have never been shot up with hormones or antibiotics which is something that is super important to me plus they have tons of variety you can get filets preseason

about the timing why is this going on now why are we getting this wag traditional textbook wag the dog strategy being employed when biden's domestic policy is a complete failure china is about to hold the olympics in like five minutes and xi jinping is going to be crowned the chairman of the ccp for life later this year at the 20th party congress and meanwhile they're losing the crisis theater of kovid as people are sick of it they're done with kobit this country's done with kovid so instead of apologizing for the hell that they've put us through they're moving on to another crisis because they want to keep you scared they want to keep your family scared and they want you hiding under the desk again you're absolutely correct and and me personally i have had enough of the russian boogeyman i mean this is like it's the theater of it has gone on for way too long you know it's like we have an election in 2020 oh you know russia russia interference russian interference obviously it took two years from discover that actually no there was no real russian interference and then they impeach him over anyway over oh right ukraine is what he was impeached about the first time right so this is actually russia gate 3.0 right again and what's what's really interesting to me though is candace at hsu that's over this you know who else is over it the germans and the french they're not going along with this the eu just announced this morning they're not pulling their diplomats from kiev and they're going to be holding one-on-one talks with russia in paris without the americans and without the british that is fascinating to me biden and blinken and the rest of them they are seen as a complete embarrassment on the world stage and after the fall of afghanistan could you blame them who would trust someone takes them seriously i wouldn't trust these guys so they're saying look we're going to deal with him because guess what we're the continent of europe they're on the same continent with us geography is destiny and like it or not we can't change our neighborhood so we are going to deal with him and they are cutting biden and blinking totally out and that is interesting because i think that that also to me substantiates the fact that this is really a biden effort right this is a biden effort he's kind of floating on his own it's like hunter biden to business interest this isn't even i don't even know if it's politics or just plain business that we're seeing take place and because america is so used to being able to strong-arm other people into their conflicts they just go okay whatever we're gonna say ukraine's got issues we're gonna have the cia put out some false reports and say we're hearing this is going on and that and that putin's gonna do this and we're expecting everybody around the world to get in line it is a big deal no we're going to have private talks with russia it shows you that we have really fallen down in terms of our influence in the international community can you at least give us a proper false flag i mean come on right we used to blow up our own ships and stuff like that you know you know this time around it's like we found a list of politicians that russia would prefer iran ukraine like of course i'm sure we have a list of that for every single country right when it comes to china whether it comes with north korea whether it comes to russia yeah every country has that list of people they'd rather have in charge but the only difference is nato and the united states are the only ones that in recent history have done so with bombings with assassinations with color revolution regime change operations that we've put in and guess what it wasn't the russians doing that it was barack obama and it was hillary clinton you're exactly right and it shows i think that it is not just americans that are becoming disillusioned with the american narrative it's not just americans that are no longer buying into these intelligence agencies that are you know littered throughout our you've got to play you oh you should've had the clip the hillary we came we saw he died right she was talking about moammar gaddafi when she said that does that sound like the kind of person you want to trust and who do we hear by the way is waiting in the wings to possibly primary joe biden in 2024 right and and because they need that they need to just pass on what's going on yeah boo is right actually i'm kind of excited about that i think it would be oh i can't wait are you kidding i want it yes i want it hillary yes give it bring it all on so much content to cover if she actually runs again but you know all of this to say is that yeah there is this sort of disillusionment taking place all around the world with america for better or for worse you know it's a good thing because i think americans are attaching themselves to reality more we're no longer believing in the fairy tale if america just goes over to just help spread democracy all across the world and i think a large part of the reason that that narrative has been collapsing is because for the first time ever we saw our intelligence agencies do to american people what they did worldwide and that was that was their slip that was where they messed up right we were all believing in the magical cinderella fairy tale all across the globe until they said you're a domestic terrorist until they started going after the american people until they started littering fbi agents throughout marches at you know to make it seem as though they started going after they say they started going after parents right that were showing up then we said wait a second if you can do this to the american people it's going to be very difficult for me to believe that you wouldn't do it to to foreign adversaries and you look at what they've done and because they've been such a failure on the world stage they're taking these same tactics they're taking the patriot act and they're turning it on american citizens they're turning it on american families and you know what credit where credit is due ron paul was right ron paul was right when he said that if you pass this patriot act mark my words in 20 years this is going to be used against americans man was 100 right that's exactly right guys i mean that this has been an amazing segment obviously we're going to have more for you guys because this situation will just get more insane and sadly more laughable upon the world stage to see what the bite administration is going to do uh really to keep up this narrative i mean they're playing with putin and putin's winning right now unfortunately predictions they are going to get good people killed again the same way they did in kabul and i don't want to see the sons and daughters of the american people dying in another forever war and a useless conflict absolutely couldn't agree more all right ladies and gents jack will be back on a recurring basis

Thanksgiving again you guys know I love Thanksgiving so much for tons of reasons it's the one holiday that I host at my house every year I take it very seriously I go out and I make sure we have all the right plates and all the right spoons and the Right Flowers the right settings I mean every detail is planned out and then I cook this year actually we are doing a fried turkey because I met someone in the South who said have you ever tried fried turkey and we said no and then we tried it and realized that we couldn't ever live without it in fact notoriously you guys know that I hate turkey and I think that we should instead do chicken on Thanksgiving but the solve to that is in fact a fried turkey so I asked you about your Thanksgiving traditions and I told you about mine last year and so for every Thanksgiving episode we are going to do that tradition live so our family tradition is that we go around the room and we say what we are grateful for for the year past it seems like such a simple thing but it is so important I mean how often do you actually sit down and think about not only think about but then write about all of the things that you are grateful for and then share those things actually say out loud hey today I am grateful for this it's not something we do often because well there's a lot of things not to be happy about there are a lot of complaints that we make and rightfully so it almost feels like we're losing our country but I think that's why I love Thanksgiving so much because it sort of forces me to pause and to put my head up and look around and to realize the blessings that are abundant in my life today and every day so I'm going to share with you 10 things that I am grateful for over these last 365 days this is in no particular order number one I am so grateful for the birth of my daughter Louise Marie farmer she is absolutely perfect it was a perfect birth perfect delivery she has been an absolute dream of a child she sleeps through the night since the moment that we brought her home she never cries she fusses only when she's hungry it just doesn't even make sense to me how lucky I got with this child I mean every child is a blessing but I'm telling you Louise is an extra blessing because she is just so gracious and kind and she just loves her big brother she's always smiling I always say that when she smiles she has this way of looking at you and then a smile spreads across her face and it's like she's seeing an old friend she instantly warms the room when she smiles which is very often another thing that I am grateful for this would be number two is I'm grateful for the South I was saying this yesterday as I was racing to the grocery store to make dinner and I was talking with my cousin and we had just I hate to say this I hate to admit this you might you're not even going to want to hear me say this but we put up our Christmas tree yesterday I know I'm so against it but somehow the South and the Rednecks have gotten me on board with early Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving why because Christmas makes me happy it makes you happy so yesterday in true redneck tradition we put up our Christmas tree and our lights early and we listened to Christmas music and it was wonderful my son was jumping around and dancing Christmas is wonderful and I'm just grateful to be down in the South not just because they put up their Christmas decorations way too early but because the people have their values right as a girl that grew up in Connecticut and of course was programmed to think Health was backwards and at the South was doing things wrong I am now an adult who realizes that these people in these small towns around Tennessee they're getting something right and that something right is family and togetherness so I'm grateful to be a part of that the third thing that I'm grateful for when I think about this past year of course is another sort of a birth giving birth to the documentary the greatest lie ever sold it was a lot of work and I was pregnant throughout the entire time that we filmed and we were able to deliver and create the documentary that I wanted this was a project that was close to my heart and to see it received by so many people to have so many people say thank you for putting this together to be a part of an Awakening not just in Black America but in all of America to be able to be in a position where I can put forth that sort of work that I can actually help a better Society by just exposing truth I mean that is that is the ultimate blessing another thing that I'm grateful for and this is a weird one but it just sort of came to my mind and I don't really know where it's going but I'm grateful that Elon Musk freed the bird I am grateful that Elon Musk took over Twitter I know that this moment is so relevant and why it's relevant may not come entirely into Focus immediately but things are changing I really do believe that the pendulum is starting to swing and it starts with just basic speech being able to say things and not have people tell us that we can't exist for holding a different view it feels like we won a little bit in that category like the totalitarian system of social media had to take a loss and so I am I'm grateful and I'm hopeful to see where that goes number five I say this but I don't say it enough that I am so grateful for all of you I mean the fact that this show is now going five days a week is incredible that we started this and didn't really know what was what it was going to be and now we're a five day a week podcast and that so many of you tune in to hear what I have to say every single day I'm grateful that you guys trust me and more importantly that you guys have allowed for me to grow you know I'm not the same Candace Owens that I was when I first started making YouTube videos I was probably more naive then probably for the better I never really realized how ugly politics could be and there have been a lot of tremendously difficult moments over these years over this year just just as one year it's been very difficult a lot of peer pressure to say this or to say that if you want to keep your platform and I've held the line because I know that it's important to me to remain True to Myself and I think in response to that you guys have hung around and that you have trusted that I'm always wanting to do what I feel is right and even if I get it wrong I will at least be willing to say that I got it wrong and with that it's next appropriate to say that I am grateful for The Supporting Cast of characters around me the people in the control room right now who drive me crazy I love them I love my entire Supporting Cast at home everybody makes it possible for me to do what I do every single day either there's a team of people that make it possible for me to be able to deliver on my vision and I this is not a a one-man Army by any means another thing I'm grateful for over this past year when I was thinking of moments that were so wonderful two trips come to mind a family trip to Cabo I just I don't know what it was about Mexico but my son absolutely loved it it was the last trip that we took as a family of three and it was quiet and it was perfect and it's something that I'll never forget seeing my son run around in that kiddie pool all by himself nobody else was there and so I'm grateful for that and I'm also grateful that we were are able to go to London as much as we want to and that we were able to spend two weeks in London as a family though those moments of introducing Louise to her grandparents who she doesn't get to see as often and them also being able to feel the warmth of her smile and of course number eight I would have to say is my son man I just can't say enough that he is just at a really fun stage right now he is hilarious and this year it was just a lot of first she started to say a lot of words and it turns him into a parrot sometimes he repeats things and when you least suspect it and it's hilarious and he definitively has my stubborn stubborn nature he his first word was Carr their go figure car car boys love cars and loved trucks and just being able to go home to him and to be able to wake him up in the morning and to put him to bed every day I am just so amazed by watching him grow and turn into a little person number nine it follows of course that I am forever grateful for my husband it is the number one thing that I tell women to do is go marry the right man go find the right man do not listen to feminism I almost feel like my life began when I met my husband and it was just such a collision something that I didn't expect when I met him over in London and I am just I became such a better person and a more whole person and a older person and a happier person and a smarter person just by doing one thing getting married to the right individual and it is why when I see women that seem so toxic and so unhappy what I do is I wish upon them that happiness I I hope that they find their other person that they find their partner and that they are able to transform their lives in the way that I was able to transform my own which brings me to number 10. Catholic faith you know we've been covering this in the podcast quite a bit of course my husband is a Catholic I am not a Catholic but I'm grateful for the Catholic faith because it has worked so many miracles in my husband's life and I am grateful that I am learning about the Catholic faith because what it is is it's Christianity and I believe so much you guys know that I believe in God I see God in all of this everything that we are talking about as the Bible States there's nothing new Under the Sun and so much of what we are fighting is a spiritual battle here on Earth it is a goodness versus an evil and by investing yourself in that goodness by investing Yourself by small acts every single day plugging into the real source you you remain optimistic you remain hopeful because you know that evil can't win in the end ladies and gentlemen that is all I have to say about that Happy Thanksgiving all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be playing a game of Thanksgiving this or that so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now Happy Thanksgiving

that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com candace to get three extra months free go to expressvpn.com candace right now to learn more it feels like things are to me at least i feel this positive energy on the ground i mean i can't imagine being joe biden and being more popular than barack obama was in 2008 like being such a kinetic force and energy but everywhere i go a they have to block me from being in front of crowds we still have not seen the most popular president in american history in front of a crowd of his supporters cheering for him isn't that bizarre but it's because of covet guys it's because of cove that's the only reason and every time there's a stadium of americans together they seem to be chanting let's go brandon um what do you what do you make of this this very ironic bizarre situation that's playing out in america right now oh also not just in america part of me germany italy people that are there's channing let's go brandon everywhere in the world it's the elitist versus the the rest of america i mean these elitists can't fathom how americans cannot just like you know you will take your president and you will like it and the rest of america is saying this is not what we signed up for i think even the people who voted for joe biden are like hold on a second we didn't sign up for these higher gas prices we didn't sign up for all of this inflation we didn't sign up for our meat to double the price at the grocery store we're just trying to make ends meet and put food on our table and our president is preventing us from doing that and i think that that's what you're seeing but again the elitists they live in these bubbles and they just they can't relate they just cannot relate to the everyday america and you have a topic for us going in line with biden's policies yeah yeah just another reason maybe why americans are having trouble uh swallowing the joe biden pill is uh the the binding administration is in talks uh with illegal immigrants who were separated the children separated from their parents they say uh at the border in 2018 under the trump policy they are now considering 450 000 payments uh for each person who was separated at the southern borders i'm an illegal immigrant as a taxpayer you spend how much giving back to the federal government for them to go and reward someone for breaking the law upon entering this country it is absolutely insane not to mention what is the most humane thing that you can do to a child who comes here with adults and you don't know if those adults are actually their parents i mean you have to separate them as a human trafficking situation and yet they will be rewarded and make i mean how many americans make that much money per year i just can't imagine what they're actually thinking on the inside i mean they just must be thinking we've got four years to ruin the country and do everything we want just go all the way to the wall and let's see what sticks that's what's something they don't even care it's like we've got four years to do as much as possible and here's the truth about democrats they never eat them they never eat the eat the rich they always eat the middle class that's the point they are eating the middle class right now which is to your point this is why people are going to the grocery store they're talking about the gas prices they don't understand what's happening this is what we've been trying to tell you you can't eat the rich the rich have a financial understanding that is higher than the biden administration right they understand exactly what's going on they know what to do with their taxes you know legally how they can make sure if their taxes don't get touched by the government it is the middle class that is going to be paying for the biden administration's idea they can just keep printing money and they are seeing that already i don't know if i feel bad for the people that voted for joe biden and are seeing this stuff at the stations i don't know how do you feel about it um i do think the democrats have a plan and i think they know what they're doing because if you look at the population statistics uh the black population is becoming stagnant the white population is decreasing there's only one population that's really growing in the country and when you give 450 thousand like you could've said a thousand i don't know why you had to go that far but 450 thousand to illegal immigrants as you cut hbcu funding simultaneously there's a reason for that well wait more money by the way for being separated from their families than the the american people who were separated from being allowed to work right they were separated from their jobs from their livelihoods for a year and what did they get a couple of thousand bucks six hundred dollars in a bank account it's just just absolutely unbelievable that they would even do that you know so yeah it's hard for me to feel bad i feel bad for people that voted the right way and this is the consequence the people that you know fought us at every turn i overheard you know a couple talking about i just can't believe this and we voted for him at the restaurant and talking about the gas prices and i wanted to interject and i wanted to say well at least trump's not tweeting right yeah absolutely thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video

some of you may know this but Thanksgiving is my absolute favorite holiday always has been a lot of people favor Christmas but I personally think that the pressure of exchanging presents it just ruins it a little bit for me Thanksgiving on the other hand the scents that are coming from the kitchen the family the sin of gluttony I mean what is there not to love I host Thanksgiving every single year and I take the planning very seriously down to the napkin colors down to the very specific turkey pepper and salt shakers that I have to have everything is planned except for the inevitable family feuds that break out I never put on those they just happen probably because don't talk about politics that holiday rule yeah it really misses the mark when you're related to Candice Owens I have to say but even beyond the topic of politics bickering is just sort of what families do right in fact my husband and I we got an early jump on it I said to my husband two weeks ago I looked him straight in the face and I said honey I just don't want to do a turkey this year no turkey it's off the menu and he went what yep we have to have turkey on Thanksgiving I said no no it's honestly listen to me hear me out it's just not very logical I mean we buy this big turkey right and then we spend hours and hours days trying to turn it into a chicken injecting it with butter wrapping it in baking wrapping it in wrapping and baking and can foil all of these elements to try to turn a turkey into a chicken so I thought let's just buy the chicken let's just buy the chicken everybody prefers the chicken I don't want to commit to this this weird ritual and beyond that my husband knows that one of my biggest concerns is where I know it's totally wear but I have I'm a little self-conscious about alien civilizations looking down and watching us do weird stuff like I just have this feeling that there are aliens looking down and Thanksgiving we were just like what are they doing what is this weird ceremony of buying the turkey to turn it into a chicken why are the humans doing this are they out of chicken no no they're completely not out of chicken they've got plenty of chicken so why are they doing this I'm self-conscious about that I just want to buy the chicken but my husband said that he couldn't imagine not having a turkey on Thanksgiving in fact he said specifically I've always had a turkey on Thanksgiving so I said back to him always you're English you've only celebrated to Thanksgiving since we've been married he's literally precisely two thanksgivings and he came back to me and he said yeah that's the point I've always had turkey on Thanksgiving anyways we've agreed that we are going to do both chicken and turkey see my earlier notes about gluttony yeah but when I think about it it's not the food that I love the most about Thanksgiving it's the Traditions it's the predictability of it all it's the madness of having my entire extended family Under One Roof crying babies huge laughter and my favorite tradition of all which takes place just before we eat I make everybody go around the table and share what they are most grateful for over the last 365 days we spend 364 days complaining about everything that's wrong and trust me I get it as of late there is plenty to choose from on this one day it really should be the challenge of every American to give voice to the things that are all right that are better than all right the things that are actually wonderful so I like to extend that tradition from my family table to yours here I'll go first and I'll tell you three things even though there are plenty more that I'm grateful for this year grateful for first and foremost number one over the last three years my grandfather every time I spoke to him he'd say I want to get the family together one last time in St Thomas that's my dying wish for a while I thought that he was being traumatic but this year something just pulled me the other way and suddenly I said you know what I gotta press pause on my life and I need to make this thing happen and I did in July of this year I organized a trip for 15 family members to go to the Virgin Islands and would you know it my grandfather passed just two and a half months later so I am beyond grateful that I got to spend that time with him but more than that I'm grateful that I don't have to live with the regret of having not done it and I think that there's a lesson somewhere in there make time for the people and the things that matter most and don't take time for granted on that note I'd have to say number two I'm sure as hell grateful that my family has chosen to ignore Dr fauci's holiday policies [Applause] how many family members can I have over for Christmas and Thanksgiving yeah no we ignored that last year we'll be ignoring that this year and you can bet the house that we're going to continue nor that every single year going forward our holiday policy is to ignore Dr fauci's holiday policies and number three I have to say I am grateful for all of you sincerely for this show for the platform that has been given to me to share my heart I am never not one day do I not stop to think about how grateful I am every single day for this it still completely blows my mind that just four years ago I was an unknown girl on YouTube uploading my first political video that my cousin shot the journey here to this moment has been nothing short of amazing and so to every person that watched shared or commented on any of my content even the haters and the losers I'm

"Av_c44JXNWs": "so the radical left has lost its collective beehive mind because georgia recently passed a bill which stipulates that you need to wait for it it's almost too terrible to read out loud if you're watching this at home please take a seat if you're driving and listening please pull over your car ready the state of georgia wants people to have id to vote now for those of you that are sitting at home thinking but wait a minute candace don't we need id to do virtually everything in society the answer is yes but apparently this is somehow different and here to help me make up some reasons as to why this is different somehow is the author of speechless controlling words controlling minds and the daily wires very own michael knowles the host of blaze tvs the news and why it matters sarah gonzalez and you may know him as the king of memes on instagram or dc drano rogano hanley michael i'm going to start with you could you please explain to my audiences why it is easier for you as a white man than it is for me as a black woman to get an id because i as i as a white man and the only i'm the only creature on earth that possesses human agency this i think this is actually what the left is saying right the left is saying that white men are the only people who can will and think about anything and that every other group of people are just passive participants so there was a line they said the other day they said if a if a black man attacks an asian man do you know why he's doing it white supremacy yeah how i'm not quite sure but really what you're saying is then everyone else they're not even people they don't even have a free will of their own it's all just white guys so i'll take it but it seems kind of real it seems a little bit rude and you have to appreciate by the way the audacity of this washington post headline which i feel we have to pull up it says getting a photo id so you can vote is easy unless you're poor black latino or elderly i have to say i recently switched states and now i'm a tennessee resident which i'm super proud of uh went to the dmv and got my license didn't have too many trouble but maybe you sarah as a latino person can explain to me how real the struggle can be yeah i mean if you listen to joe biden and democrats i mean we heard joe biden not that long ago say well i mean you know how hard it is for minorities to do that thing like get on a computer i mean like we're just so inept that we can't fathom getting on a computer to figure out where to get a vaccine where to go vote how to get an id i mean we see this coming from the left all the time it's just this headline to me is just so remarkably explicitly racist imagine putting any other sentence there like if i just said uh you know reading is easy unless you're black you know what i mean making a reservation at a restaurant is easy unless you're black i mean i mean like this is not even the big tree of low expectations this is just blatant racism house is not racism well look at the new democrat party same as the old democrat party they wanted to control black people in the 1800s and now they're trying to do it again thinking that they can't think for themselves but the statistics do not back it up whatsoever overwhelmingly over 70 percent of people believe voter id is a positive thing a good thing a majority of people in georgia support their new law and you know it's just uh this is just how democrats are treating people they don't think they can do it on their own my favorite part of the article by the way was the fact that it said elderly like do they think that old people like are born 65 like they haven't had id their entire life and it's like once you turn 60 off five you're like i don't know everything's gone i don't know what to do it's just ridiculous well candace don't you feel grateful that we have the white saviors i do save the day for us yeah that's always what it is the white people telling us what we need to feel what we need to think where we need to go get ideas right i have to say actually that this particular one it didn't actually stick with black people usually democrats are able to drum up enough faux outrage that black people take the bait and they take to the streets but this time minorities are like i'm gonna sit this one out i actually have id right here in my back pocket so of course the democrats decide to press corporations to take a stand which resulted in of course the mlb which usually hosts its all-star game in atlanta being among the first to k publicly announcing they were going to move the game out of atlanta pretty sure atlanta is like an all black city it's a very black city so they're instead going to move it to denver which is a very white city and of course this is just you know in order to help black people we gotta hurt black people right well be honest yeah they they're gonna move in in the name of racial justice they're gonna move it from a black city to a white city but you raised this great point which is the majority of black people support voter id the majority of black people support the provisions of this bill right and yet the democrats get away with it why is that the majority of americans on another issue majority of americans want to secure the border want to reduce immigration legal and illegal but the left gets open borders and they push that through why is that it's because they have attained a certain level of cultural power that they are in all these institutions in sports in universities in government all over the place so they don't really care it doesn't matter if 70 of black people support voter id they are going to cram this down their throats because they wield political power a lot better than we do and we're and we're just the pawns and also by the way what i really loved was the corporations that then signed on the dotted line and said we agree we're backing this up pull up some of these corporations it's amazing so we've got uber pretty sure you need to have an idea to use uber definitely need to have an idea to become an uber driver you got delta airlines i i don't know if you can board a flight without an id i've never tried it but i'm pretty sure that's negative you've got paypal all transactions report require credit card you cannot get a credit card without id etsy just randomly threw its name in the pot same thing in order to buy clothes or buy anything you have to have a credit card i mean is this not hypocritical at all if you buy tickets to a baseball game and they're at the will call you have to show your id to pick them up and and the stats are actually very clear you black participation in voting increases where voter id is there people have more faith in the system and you know there's really no difference between democrat republican people want uh fair and free elections and it's a major problem that we're having in this country right now people have lost a little bit of faith and georgia is trying to restore them so that when these leaders are elected people say you know what that's who won that's who's going to govern our state which is why i think that when it all shakes out i do think that eventually the pendulum is going to swing back the other way because as rogan pointed out there's new polls that show that overwhelmingly voters and this is uh even splits of republican democrat and independents they all believe in voter id they all believe in secure elections and more importantly they all overwhelmingly think that corporations should not get into politics right and i think that you know just as michael jordan said republicans buy shoes too and i think that the more that these corporations go out and do this the more that people are going to vote with their money let me ask do you think that the corporations are afraid like are they are they implementing woke culture despite like you're saying cystic show people don't like what culture and corporations are they doing it because they're genuinely afraid or are they sort of just a part of what culture and actually believe the things they're saying like does coca-cola actually believe black americans don't know how to get id you know i think woke culture or you call political correctness the name changes but it's always the same devil it serves the interests of the institutional left and we for a long time on the right have made this neat distinction between the public and the private the government and the companies really it's all kind of part of the same thing right the universities and big tech and corporate america and the administrative government all working together to silence conservative views so i think it really serves a great purpose you see this poll that comes out from daily wire says americans are turning against mlb and yet they continue to wield that power certain politicians are getting wise to this ron desantis in florida said we've gotta we've gotta bring consequences to corporate media to other corporations even mitch mcconnell who is the face of the republican establishment he said that we cannot be so focused only on government problems that we allow woke corporations to create a parallel government that's the worst situation of all and i'm glad that conservatives are waking up to it and let me just say speaking as you know your stereotypical straight white republican male that lives in the south white's playing it too here we go white's fighting we want the modern gop wants black votes we are fighting for them and thank you to you know candace and others in the blexit movement we increased black votes for the republican party to record numbers we want more of them why would we want to stifle the same people that we're trying to recruit into our and that we're successfully recruiting like you said according to the exit polls we're successfully recruiting them so why would you want to stifle them it doesn't make sense what else does it what else does not seem to make sense to me is that you have the democrats um on the one hand they're saying this is this last election was the freest and fairest of all nothing went wrong there was no funny business god forbid anybody questioned the integrity of the 2020 election you will get silence you will get censored donald trump has become he who must not be named lord voldemort i can't believe i said it on tv it's not appropriate to say lord voldemort right it's like you'll get cancelled they're pulling down youtube channels even people that are saying actually here the numbers look weird right so then let me ask a question if it really was that joe biden is the most popular president of all time right he's got more votes than any of the living or dead american president ever he might be both right he could very well be both right why do they have a problem with election integrity right the only people who don't want to show id when you go to a bar are the people that are under 21 years old okay if you have your id if you're over age then you just show it no problem it and it's it's a move being pushed by the establishment in dc by the establishment hollywood because they know that's their only ticket to pull some funny business in elections once people just have it clean cut and have your id shown you know republican ideas tend to win a lot of people are looking at america first policies and really liking them so they're trying to stifle it and trying to limit how many people can vote for it and now they're changing the language and they're saying oh it's actually it's the rural blacks i can't have access and somebody actually tweeted at me they were like well candace people that live in rural areas black people that live in rural areas their houses are so off the beaten path they don't have access to a dmv and i'm like did you say houses because you actually need an id to buy a house are they renting that house or buying i gotta assume that these people have a little bit of id and it's just there's just no excuse for any person to say that they black people latino people poor people elder people do not have access to google dmv near me it's just painfully ridiculous and i will say these corporations and all this virtue signaling i'm getting to the point right now where i want a free market response to this like i'm at the point i don't you could sell nothing and just say i don't do politics and i'd say take my money right just donate just just because well and i think you know i think when i was a little bit more naive maybe pre-2016 before everyone went crazy when the orange man got elected um i i must not be naked yes exactly sorry lord voldemort um i think that i was under the impression that you know well we need to be uh more uh moral we need to be take the high road we need to be the more moral ones and the more the left plays this game i'm like no fight fire with fire good on georgia for eliminating the you know the tax breaks for delta i think that that's how we need to play it yeah at this point because you you don't win by saying no we're always going to take the high road we're not going to wade into this by the way i don't think that's fighting dirty i think that's just fighting you know the people give you political power so that you can wield it but cowardly republicans have been throwing that away because they don't want to risk themselves i i hope that president trump lives a good long life and then i hope when he goes to his eternal reward he donates his body to science and his spine to the gop because i think that's the right thing they could use that's the moral thing to do they could use that for sure thanks for joining me on this segment of

just wanted to bring this piece to your Consciousness because this is going to happen in America we're already seeing the beginning of it it is regarding the topic of of euthanasia so medically people are walking into clinics and killing themselves this is legal in Switzerland they are having a debate that is waging across Europe about this as I told you the other day should you be allowed to kill yourself now most Americans and when we had this discussion the other day wrote comments to me and said Candice that's for the terminally ill you're not educated about this a couple of people actually wrote this to me you're not educated about this and I commented back and I said no you're not educated about this the fact that you believe that this is about terminal illness and this is about compassion uh is exactly what the government wants you to believe of course the slope is always slippery and this article tells us just how slippery it is it's talking specifically about Canadian law and if you didn't know since last year Canadian law has allowed both the rich as well as the poor to kill themselves if they just don't want to continue living some people are deciding that they are too poor to continue living but they say now you can die with dignity dignity is the word that they keep using it's about oh you can't have a life of dignity so wouldn't you just rather die right it's not even you don't have a life of dignity if you're poor and I want to focus on just that term dignity because the left does that over and over and over again it is always a game of euphemisms they make something sound pretty and something sound flowery right how can we make death sound flowery to Americans and like the right thing to do oh I know we'll call abortion pro-choice doesn't that sound better than saying that mothers are reaching inside of their wombs and pulling their children out because I don't know if you're Michelle Williams you you have a career in Hollywood and you're not ready to have a kid and you want to get a trophy a statue you hope you can win an Emmy or an Oscar so you're making a choice it's Reproductive Rights flowery terms also for the the trans children it's gender affirming care what a lovely lovely way to say that you are chemically castrating children gender affirming care we'll talk more about that later social justice even that term it's so lovely sounding or do you feel like you're skipping through flowers in a field social justice of what we actually mean is black lives matter is outside and they're going to burn down the place for social justice and not Pursuit but it's social justice so I guess they can just keep saying that back to Canada so now we we're going to start hearing this term more and more about dying with Dignity right to you you can no longer have this life with dignity so so Canada has done this and the way that they did this I want to unpack the history of this so the Supreme Court of Canada used to have a law that banned assisted suicide it used to just be unconstitutional in 2015 they reversed that ban so they had all of these years of jurisprudence and they said nope never mind we're going to undo it and people were reasonably fearful right they said of course we should not do this because the slope will get slippery and you will have people that are just going to kill themselves people that are vulnerable that are just going to say I'm going to kill myself and the Supreme Court of Canada said ah those are just anecdotal examples plus again this is back in 2015. uh we are only making this assisted suicide Avail available for people who suffer from a terminal illness or whose natural death was reasonably foreseeable so this is where the American conscience is right now it's like okay well we're talking about that are terminally ill people that we know are going to die rather than having them suffer we're allowing them to take a pill and to kill themselves there's an example of this in Oregon there was a girl who took a pill because she was in so much pain with a rare brain brain cancer that she had right oh except that wasn't enough it took only five years for them to say you know what this um terminal illness stuff and this reasonably foreseeable death it's not really necessary so in 2020 the Canadian Parliament enacted bill c-7 which was a sweeping euthanasia law that repealed that requirement right you no longer had to be in a condition that was determined to be terminal and you no longer had to have reasonably foreseeable death upon you now you just had to be someone that is suffering from an illness or a disability which quote cannot be relieved under conditions that you would consider acceptable that really cranks it open hey just conditions that you would consider acceptable and they can't relieve them so now it's okay to take advantage of what is known euphemistically of course as medical assistance in dying that is made for short and by the way the government will kill you for free for free this is actually happening in Canada we will take care of the costs don't you worry if you feel that you are a burden and you cannot necessarily relieve these burdens in your life we will pay for you to die with dignity right and so of course Canadians all across the country began opting into this now of course this is being abused and I'm going to give you just one example a man that had a neurodegenerative disease testified to the Canadian Parliament that nurses and a medical ethicist whatever that is at a hospital tried to coerce him into killing himself by threatening to bankrupt him with extra costs they also withheld water from him for 20 days this is inside of a hospital you should kill yourself you should kill yourself if you know if you don't kill yourself you're not even able to afford to live because your insurance is not going to cover this this is exactly by the way even though it wasn't euthanasia it would happen in the hospital when I wanted to leave they basically told me that you if you leave the hospital and you don't stay for 48 hours we're gonna mark this down and your insurance may not cover the entire birth that you just had that is a thuggery that is taking place in hospitals in America now for people that are giving birth and that is a thuggery that is taking place in hospitals in Canada this man testified because they wanted him to kill himself we no longer want you to be here you can't afford this goodbye as another example a woman in Ontario was forced into euthanasia because her housing benefits did not allow her to get better housing which should not aggravate her crippling allergies and there was another woman a disabled woman who applied to die because she simply could not afford to keep on living so being poor right that's the pitch you're poor and of course their media has assisted in this they have state-sponsored media which is trying to make people think that this is a good thing that this is a compassionate thing that suicide actually suicide assisted by your government assisted by the hospitals is something that should be aspired to now why well because they figured out that poor people are costly right they actually discussed the parliament discuss the fiscal advantages of Bill C7 they ran the numbers they figured out that they could save an extra 62 million dollars per year if they just removed this barrier of thinking that people needed to be terminally ill in fact just allowing euthanasia to take place in general uh saved the country 86.9 million dollars per year so that's the pitch those who have to rely wholly on government provided Medicare pose a far greater burden on the government of course this could reasonably happen in America I could see this pitch especially to Black America who has fallen for pitches before of the government saying that you need to be the first people on the front lines fighting Against Racism as they like to call it and of course it's never actually racism that we're fighting but we get all fired up by that word I could see the government pitching to Black America that it would be racist not to allow us to kill ourselves right just like they say at random times that the abortion industry is good for black Americans and to not allow abortion is especially harmful and racist to black Americans right it's black Americans that have killed their offspring 18 over 18 million black babies have been aborted since 1973. also why as I mentioned is because the media is making it seem like it's cool right the media is making it seem like it's the right thing to do this is when the celebrities come into play mask up save lives right there's always a concert effort and a campaign to propagandize these more Sinister efforts now in case you think this would never happen to us Canada is just to the north of course it could if Europe is debating it if if Switzerland has already made it legal and if America is already talking about expanding that legislation then of course it's going to happen unless you forget there were already two women perfectly healthy that were not terminally ill that killed themselves they lived in Arizona they got on a plane two sisters their names were Lila Amore she was 54 years old and Susan Fraser just 46 years old randomly got up they both had jobs they both lived in nice houses they took a plane they told their friends and colleagues that they were just going on a trip in Europe and they killed themselves in Switzerland they had a team of medical professionals that assisted them in killing themselves because they just wanted to die so to go back to that question of whether or not you think that your government would intentionally harm you you better deeply consider the answer to that question because it is your children it is our children are going to have to grow up in this world if we do not start having these questions and really examining our government's agenda all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on the recent Trump lawsuit and I'll be sharing how I told my husband that I was pregnant so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "YkKzmE8e7TU": "many people ask me how do you use they them pronouns for a singular person well it's really easy all you have to do is use it the same way that you would talk about a group of people so for example i addison use they them pronouns in that case you talk about me like this i know addison they are amazing now a fun fact about they them pronouns is that they've been used in a singular context for centuries even going back to shakespearean times there's actual documentation and literature using they and them in singular context our language is constantly changing and adapting we're evolving to find new terms and language to self-identify so get with the times don't be an apple i just sometimes think that we have to hit the reset button on humanity and start over i also have this strange urge to meet everyone's parents i just want to know who raised him are they who raised them", "Ird0kVhBaBg": "[Applause] welcome back you guys may be familiar with janelle evans now janelle evans eason who spent nine years as a cast member on mtv's 16 and pregnant as well as teen mom 2 before getting fired and essentially canceled for something that her husband did today she is here to speak out in an exclusive interview for the first time since her contract with mtv ended please help me welcome to the show janelle evans eason very nice to have you here thank you i was talking to you backstage and i told you that i i've watched teen mom i watched the early teen mom i don't know about the you know the secondary people but i watched you i watched farah and it does feel like i've almost watched you grow up because you were just 16 uh when you got pregnant and were on the franchise so tell me about how you ended up on the franchise let's start there so basically back to when i was pregnant i watched ferris first episode of 16 and pregnant and i was like i wonder if they're looking for someone else because i was seven months pregnant and i just looked on mtv.com on casting calls and um you can just look up whatever shows they're about to have up and you just applied yeah you just um you write them your story send them some pictures they called me two days later and they wanted to meet up now obviously you are a minor then so when you apply was the conversation between you and your mother was it yes it was um we want to meet up with you and your mother and have lunch and we met up with the two producers and we had lunch and they explained to us their concept and at that time it was 16 and pregnant so then i did only one episode for 16 and pregnant and then after that they were like we want you to join teen mom and i said okay so how many years in total nine years you've given to to mtv and this nine year comes to an end do you have these producers in your life for all nine years do you feel like you know them or they like your family members yeah it's pretty sad to see um you know we had a such strong relationship and now my kids like my oldest one jace he's going to be 12 now and he's used to like being around them all the time he's kind of like where did they go what happened i hope you're enjoying the show so far and i'm afraid to say it but

that's expressvpn.com candice to learn more notoriously it was all over the news you were fired from teen mom um and it was because you're now husband at least the way it read in the press i'm going to give you an opportunity to explain it shot your dog and it went viral the story went viral and then they fired you yes what happened what was the background to that story so basically um me and my uh it was me my daughter and my other two kids and david and we were all sitting in the living room and you know my daughter and the dog were having like a cute little moment so david started filming from far away and then all of a sudden she went to go give the dog a hug and the dog like bitter on the face almost in the eye okay so then um after that happened you know the the way david was raised he took the dog outside and took care of it himself my kids were inside the house at the time did not see anything did not hear anything david didn't announce what he was doing or anything so so two questions i want to ask you first you said the way he was raised what do you mean by that he's very country i was raised in um pennsylvania and then he was born and raised in the south so like if a dog was aggressive they would either put it down themselves and david said you know if i took the dog to the humane society they probably would have done the same thing because of aggression but this was obviously very shocking but it was wasn't it you who broke the story about it though on twitter well it wasn't me particularly um actually we i i was trying to keep it private and i wasn't trying for anybody to find out because i felt like it was more of a family matter that needed to be dealt with but tmz got a hold of my ex's phone call that said i heard a dog was shot in front of my son so that 9-1-1 call on tmz ended up public okay and this was before you met you said because didn't you say something publicly about and and then and then yes and then after after that news came out i was like all right i gotta come out and explain say something yep so you felt like maybe you felt pressure like i need to do pr on this because this is leaking yes and i need to get out in front of it and i need to say something that this this was scary this happened and of course it upsetted me and i'd angry with it and david knows and we've talked about it and he's felt bad for what he did and you know he's like i wish i would have done something else so he does definitely realize the um the stress it did put on our family right was he angry was it a response of like or just i'm gonna go get rid of this dog because it's shot yeah just kind of like you know this is an aggressive animal to my daughter so i feel like this is what i need to do and you're sort of saying that for you he's from the south he's from the country this was a natural response when they bite when they you know bite a child you are correct that they do put animals down for that um but they would say it's more humane if you take it somewhere to be done do you think it's more humane or um i do and you know that's why david said maybe you know rehoming it would have been better and maybe someone could have worked with the dog so i think he definitely realizes he you know he's apologized so much that he's like i'm like okay okay i understand i understand and it still hurts me to this day and um you know it's hard to get over it but you know it's slowly happening i want to talk about your your low moments obviously i remember watching so many of them fights with you and your mother you have been arrested a lot of times how i mean do you know how many times i yes i think i've counted like 24. 24 times you've been arrested 24 times a lot of drug related charges a lot of ignoring court order charges you did am i correct to say that you did have an addiction well it was uh oh yes yes i did yes i did for um about six six month period in my life what was the drug that you were addicted to it was heroin okay so i mean i first want to just commend you on getting over a heroin addiction because that is not easy so i'd like to give a round of applause thank you i don't think people know how hard it is uh to you know be addicted to drugs it's one of the biggest crises that we face in america today have you know the opioid crisis um and so you were addicted to heroin were they filming you during this time yes they were and their scenes of me nodding out and me thinking in that moment i thought no one will know i'm messed up and no no one will notice it and then i look at it and i'm like wow i'm sitting there like nodding out like this is not good and um it's a vicious cycle when you're on that drug because when you try to get off of it you get sick and you get so sick like you have the flu that if you don't take a little bit of it you won't feel better and to get over it you have to be in that sickness for like seven days thanks for joining me on this episode of candace i have some very

you how dare you she's just a little child actually she's not just a little child uh she's 19 now and I am just noticing that there's a lot of pieces about Greta Thunder what could possibly be the reason for that so in this glowing piece which was done by the times they essentially just caught up with her caught up the little activist that changed the world by bravely cutting school if I had known that cutting school was an act of Bravery I would have explained to my parents that I was being heroic I was being heroic when I cut my classes in high school and so in this article there's a lot of weird things that I could bring up I I found it a bit bizarre she kind of keeps talking about her own celebrity and what it's like you know to have the paparazzi follow her and that she doesn't even use security but she did need security When Donald Trump tweeted quite hilariously that she seemed like a very happy child and he wished her the best in her her future when she was staring at him like a demon with her arms folded at the U.N it was a very funny tweet obviously tongue-in-cheek point to the fact that this seems like a disturbed child I mean what teenager would go Halfway Around the World to stand there furiously at Trump clearly for the cameras she was a plant he made light of the situation without saying anything bad at her but allegedly according this interview that made it so that she had to have security because I don't know I guess a bunch of trump supporters are in Sweden looking to beat her up I don't really know where she was going with that anyway she moves on to talk about how she doesn't date or drink because of her celebrity she doesn't want to give anybody the satisfaction of saying I drank with Greta Thunder because I know that that is on everybody's bucket list definitely mine I was like if I can get Greta thundberg drunk I will have made a difference in this world but what I found interesting was that she also uh she tweeted about the fact and I'm just going to read her tweet directly because it's interesting she tweeted my Gap year ends in August but it doesn't take a college degree in economics to realize that our remaining carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and Investments don't add up so either you tell us how to achieve this mitigation or explain to Future generations and those already affected by the climate emergency why we should abandon our climate commitment so essentially they need more money again it's incredible they have needed trillions of dollars they're gonna need more trillion dollars to be able to fix the climate and if you don't have an answer for how they're supposed to do it on these trillions of dollars that we've given them since the beginning of climate alarmism then you're going to have to answer to Greta thundberg because she's now the face this very Celebrity non-drinking Face of the climate change movement and I do feel hear me out I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist but I do feel that timing of her re-emergence into the political scene it's a bit suspicious suspect right we just spoke about in the monologue how Europe is facing an energy crisis so is America right Biden just announced that they're they're tapping at our oil reserves because they're realizing they cannot control the price for gas they can't control it because we are not energy independent like we were under President Donald Trump he's been he's going over and begging OPEC we are just in facing an energy crisis all over so what better way to prepare the people for this than to tether them to the reality that having any concerns about this would be wrong right and a thunder how dare you how dare you be concerned that you're having to bring in logs of wood to keep yourself warm this winter don't you see the bigger problem is that we aren't giving the government enough money to solve it do you see how selfish you're being when you just want to heat your home there is a climate emergency and we're gonna need just a little bit more cash and we're going to need you to stay at home we're gonna need to not use electricity grid worship government that is why they're bringing that girl back so keep your eye on her they're going to be using her a lot as they always have but the good news is she's not a teenager anymore so it's open season she even took her pigtails out so she's not going to fool you anymore about how young she is one alternative asset that you really need to check out is multi-million dollar art at Masterworks Masterworks buys paintings from legendary artists like Picasso and Banksy and breaks them into shares so you can invest for a fraction of the cost then when a painting sells again you get your potential return on that investment so far they've sold six paintings for an average net return of 29 these returns have remained consistent through covid inflation recession and everything else that has destroyed our investment portfolios over the last couple

important regulation A disclosures at masterworks.com CD again that's masterworks.com promo code Candace moving on I was telling you earlier about how I did a couple of College events University events and I tell them and I speak to them that the purpose of school is to try to essentially convince a bunch of children a bunch of students rather to become dependent on the government they're teaching them nonsense they're handing out meaningless degrees I mean how the hell is it possible that in America you can be a major in gender studies you can do that you can be a major in like lesbian dance Theory you can do that you can just pick all of these meaningless degrees and spend four years learning about something that is not going to help you in the real world so imagine my surprise when I read this Forbes article which explains that high school students act College admission test scores fell to a three decade low in 2022. according to a new report that was released on Wednesday falling for the fifth straight year as Educators grapple with ongoing learning loss made worse by remote classes during the covid-19 pandemic students in the graduating high school class of 2022 averaged a score of 19.8 out of 36 which is the lowest score since 1991 on the admissions test the average score is down from 20.3 in 2020 in 2021 and 20.8 in 2018 which were down from a recent high of 21.2 in 2007. uh so that's interesting and there is something that you should know which is that right now in America we have never handed out more degrees more people are graduating than ever before and yet they're dumber than they've ever been so think about that think about that in your head how is that possible more degrees Dumber kids going out into the world I'll tell you how it's possible because our education system the Department of Education which should be abolished this was their mission their mission is not to make your children smart or productive in the world their mission is to turn them into activists for the government through their various different causes their mission is to get your children hooked to one of their many Cults that they're selling them so maybe the cultures race they want that child to come out and to scream black lives matter and to burn down the inner city communities and then to go oh my gosh we are facing a policing catastrophe even though we literally just said defund the police and now we're going to need more money for the government to deal with this crisis that the very government created right maybe they are turning your child into a gender freak who thinks that you can just pick your gender and that kids should be on a bunch of drugs and puberty blockers which render them really incapacitated for life because they're always sick and they're constantly having to go back and be put on more drugs to deal with the sicknesses that are coming along right well of course that becomes a a ward of the state think about it you come a ward of a state you're constantly taking money because you need insurance you need Medicaid we need the government to come and deal with this issue of course we need we need Medicaid to step in why should I have to pay for my medical bills all because I wanted to be a woman I actually wasn't born a woman that's not fair yeah what we're facing in this country is statism right and it has been going on in the education system for a very long time it really began with the Banning of the Bible because what is one thing that all Communist States have in common oh it's illegal to practice religion yeah that is what happened they they make they criminalize faith because what they need you to have is only faith in governance Deliverance for every single problem that you have only faith in government deliverance and so that's what's going on there I've been trying to tell people this when they're like my kid has to go to college I know get it I get it parents it feels so good when you post that photo on Facebook and you say just dropped him off at his dorm at insert University here but you need to tether yourself through the reality that the university ecosystem is bad it's backwards it is actually disadvantaging your kids they are trying to turn them into robots for society and they are actually actively turning them against their parents right your parents are wrong and backwards you are the future the future is Progressive we're all going to own nothing and like it that's the way of the world that is the way that they want the world to be to say the least thank you guys so much for joining me today come back back tomorrow for an all-new episode [Music]", "tQS98FOXr8Y": "ladies and gentlemen it is my distinct honor to welcome back dr robert malone who is going to discuss monkey pox with us exactly what it is exactly what it isn't i hope that you guys enjoy this discussion we just saw the government take so much power from people over what really amounted for most individuals uh to be a simple cult i know i i am not vaccinated um against covet 19 i've had covert 19. it was a really what i describe as a 48-hour mild flu and people had their entire lives ruined for it so i guess dr malone do you think that this is even feasible when public trust in what is called public health is so low i mean they lied so much they took so many powers away they didn't give them back willingly we were told this is temporary we were we were doing things that really amounted to like medieval spells you know wearing masks believing that you could you know hold onions and get vampires to go away to hold garlic parted and get uh vampires to go away from you and they kept this nonsense up so i i don't believe that some pivot and now you're going to talk about monkey pucks that people are going to listen to a single word the government has to say and i also just don't trust the government at all like i am at a zero percent trust level with the government if they started saying that they wanted to quarantine individuals who had monkey pox i would fight against it because my trust is so low after coven have you ever heard of data brokers they collect and sell all of the digital footprints that you leave online they then stitch together detailed profiles and sell your profile off to a company who delivers you a targeted ad no biggie right well you might be surprised to learn that these same data brokers are also selling your information to the department of homeland security and to the irs so to mask my digital footprints i protect myself with expressvpn one of the easiest ways for brokers to aggregate data and tie it back to you is through your device's unique ip address which also reveals information about your location when you're connected to expressvpn your ip address is hidden that makes it much more difficult for data brokers to identify who exactly you are expressvpn also encrypts 100 of network traffic to keep your data safe from hackers on public wi-fi that's why i have the expressvpn app downloaded on all of my devices my phone my computer even my home wifi router all i do is tap one

about this potential tragedy of the destruction of public trust and faith in public health and faith in positions and faith in hospitals and faith in all vaccines uh far back as we saw these behaviors these weaponization of public health for other agendas be deployed you're you you raise a key point with also how does this uh monkey box outbreak now play into that environment and we've seen it we've seen it on both sides we've seen the overaction on the media side the media has now learned about how useful public health outbreak can be in terms of driving clicks and revenue and viewership and i think that that is leading them to overreact and on the other side we have this profound fear and trepidation and lack of faith on the part of much of the public which i think is is uh well-founded staring at our screens all day iphones tablets yeah not good for our eyes if you're like me it causes headaches for you can cause digital eye strain your eyes can even get watery or just

next day they kept knocking and it was once again night time and the moment came where the night nurse was coming on duty and it was a woman named deandra i will never forget her very very sweet woman you know very sweet seemed a little bit clueless but totally harmless and i said deandra i have one request tonight and she said what's that and i said i just need to sleep i'm asking you to give me four hours uninterrupted i've not slept i have not slept for more than maybe 60 minutes at a time before i get another knock another interruption and she looks like she understood what i was saying and said okay i'll do my best not to interrupt you i feel this is a very simple sane request to not be interrupted for four hours after you have just gone through the miracle of birth so i'm i get in i'm all nuzzled my husband's sleeping on that super uncomfortable chest super uncomfortable couch pardon me and i'm going this is it i'm going to be able to sleep for four hours i kid you not i can't tell you how much time went by before i hear a faint knock on the door i guess deandra's solution was she was just going to be a little more quiet right she was just going to i'm just going to be quieter when i knock of course i heard it but i heard my husband jump up and go to the door he was going to be a hero and he was going to intercept her and she said something to him and she came inside but i just resolved that i was going to sleep through whatever it was that she was doing maybe she was there for the vital check again i don't know but i was going to sleep through it maybe five minutes transpire and i suddenly hear my daughter who was completely knocked out cold start wailing at the top of her and i mean she is she's got a pair of lungs on her she is screaming like i have never heard her scream i mean it's only been 24 hours since she's been alive but she is giving it she's ah i'm thinking the whole floor is going to wake up my goodness what could you it's 2 a.m in the morning what are you doing so i get up and i'm just like are you kidding me like what what is going on and i see my baby has been put on a scale that cold scale at all babies hate she's gone from being bundled up and asleep and diandra has taken her out of her swaddle put her on a cold metal scale naked and of course she starts wailing and i just couldn't believe it i thought to myself you've got to be kidding me you think that weighing a baby that is just over 24 hours old is a necessary reason to wake a mother up in the middle of the night two we're talking two o'clock in the morning you thought this was a necessary intervention but of course every knock in a hospital is a cha-ching right this is what they're billing you for knock knock take this medicine knock knock we have to push on your stomach knock knock we're here to give you advil knock knock we're here to check the vitals they know that this is dollars and they're not going to stop making money in the middle of the night so they're coming they've come to away the baby i mean a serious question i'm not even pretending that i know everything about this topic how much weight can a baby reasonably lose within 24 hours i mean she's feeding i mean how much weight could she have reasonably lost from being born one day ago to this moment at 2am in the morning i don't know that's an open-ended question again you guys can tell me if i'm wrong and i'm missing something so at this point i just get up and i'm so angry and i say we're leaving look at my husband and he sees that look in my eye that i gave her i go we're done here i'm not i need to sleep i'm going to go crazy if i do not sleep let's get up and let's go. andreandra says to me oh she said uh we we have not yet performed the newborn screening now the newborn screening in case you guys don't know this is a test it's a blood test that they make babies take infants of course among the other tests athletic and they just run to see if they have any you know genetic issues that will come in a basic blood test and i'm saying i want to get out of here right now this blood test can be performed at a later date we will take her to a pediatrician i i want to leave right now and deandra looked at me and she kind of made a face like okay okay okay and um i i need to go get the head nurse so deandra goes to get the head nurse and i think it must have been 45 minutes that transpired i can't really tell you because i was in unbelievable haze and she comes back with a woman who has a form and she looks at me and she says i hear you want to leave before the newborn screening and i said yep i want to get out right now i need to go home and i need to sleep for my sanity. and she says well i'm going to have to give you this form i kid you not they hand me this form right it is just before four o'clock in the morning and it is a form and she even highlighted highlighted the section that was relevant and says i have been informed that under tennessee law title 68 chapter 5 requires these tests and that a refusal of these tests is a misdemeanor she said i'm here to tell you that if you don't allow us to take your baby's blood it is a misdemeanor i kid you not when i say i just started laughing i i i it was like a maniac i didn't even i didn't even understand i was in another world another haze i thought to myself am i am i starting to hallucinate do i have actually a nurse in front of me telling me that it's a misdemeanor if i do not submit my newborn baby's blood to her do i understand i just laughed and i just went i said can i can i see that form can i can i take this home and she went uh-huh and i said and for my understanding um when you say a misdemeanor am going to write a ticket am i going to get arrested do i have a court hearing and she said well i don't know because no one's ever refused it and i just started laughing i couldn't do anything but laugh my husband said okay we will wait until you take the baby's blood okay we will wait but we nee we want to leave immediately so she then says well we can't even if we take the baby's blood test right now we can't let you leave in the middle of the night because you have to be signed out by the ob gyn and the pediatrician and i just said when are they going to be here she said they're not going to be here until tomorrow morning so the earliest you can leave is when you get these two individuals to sign you out of the hospital so i'm thinking you know what it's already 4am couple of hours they should be on duty and i'm going to get myself signed out please take her take my daughter and do the necessary blood tests which by the way i want to say this i'm not against obviously infants getting blood tests i think it's a good thing to know whether or not your child is born with any issues and i am not against when i say i'm against big pharma i'm not against going to get a blood test um but i am very much against the idea that there is a law that i am required to give my baby's blood within 24 hours to the states because what happens what happens when you give blood you know where does where does this blood go now i want to make this point very very clear i am not against genetic screening i'm just not against the genetic blood test that takes place to see whether or not your child has any disorders in fact i think that's probably a good thing it's likely saved some lives but it is quite extraordinary when you're told that it's a misdemeanor if you do not submit your blood to the state now a conspiracy theorist might think and i was not a conspiracy theorist i was just a tired mom saying i want to go home i want to i don't want to take any more tests i want no more knocks i want to go home but a conspiracy theory my theorist might think okay is the state doing something with that blood why would they make it so severe that it's a misdemeanor i don't tend to ever think that the state loves your children so much that they put in place a law like that because they just want to help kids that maybe have some genetic disorders and this is actually funny because a month later a month after i gave birth to my daughter this article popped up which i want to uh just read the headline for you guys police used a new jersey baby's mandatory blood sample to pursue a criminal case public defenders and a newspaper are now teaming up to sue over privacy concerns a new lawsuit is asking how often police in new jersey use dna from blood samples taken from newborn babies to build criminal cases against their family members the state public defender's office wants to know if screenings that are mandatory to test a hundred thousand newborns every year are being used to sidestep constitutional rights news 12 new jersey's alex sedan reports from trenton there are so many dangers when we talk about having sort of easy access to people's genetic material to me i don't think that that's that's worth the risk are jersey cops trying to get around having warrants to get suspects dna by using a state database of blood samples taken from newborn babies and most of the time parents aren't even told that this blood is being taken and what purpose that it's going to be used for hospitals around the state draw blood from newborns to test for 60 different types of diseases the blood samples are kept by the state for up to 23 years but in at least one case the public defender's office is alleging the state police obtained a sample from the newborn database to analyze whether it tied the child's father to a crime committed in 1996. so it's kind of like sidestepping around the search warrant where they don't have enough probable cause to go after a specific person a parent and a biological child share 50 of the same dna the public defender thinks the subpoena for the child's dna may be a violation of the fourth amendment protecting against unreasonable searches just something you might like to know this actually happened in new jersey so imagine you her couple you submit to this newborn screening you assume that it's just for genetic testing and then you find out later that somebody in your family gets gets convicted of a crime because they used that blood to track them down just something you should potentially know but again back to me in the hospital not the reason i want to skip this test i just want to get home so that me and my husband and my recently born daughter can get some sleep great news you guys we are going five days a week introducing to you guys candace owens that's the right title and it's going to be every day a podcast monday through friday and here's what you're going to get all the things that you maybe are getting on my social media channel all in one spot the first episode we're going to talk about my birth story a very exciting birth story that ends with the child protective services being threatened against me you guys to get all of this information and watch me go after people that deserve to be gone after you're gonna have to become a daily wire plus subscriber that way you'll get exclusive access to my extended show and more content i'll see you guys there", "wF6YlnmbD5w": "okay so there's a lot on my mind today so I'm just gonna splatter at you I'm just gonna talk at you and it sort of begins with the CIA program MK Ultra which like all very bad CIA programs they tell us that it's been discontinued and we get no more information about it and we're supposed to believe that it magically went away so let's talk about MK Ultra MK Ultra was a top secret CIA project in which the agency conducted hundreds of experiments sometimes on unwitting U.S citizens to assess the potential use of LSD and Other Drugs for mind control okay so this is about mind control and why was the CIA interested in controlling the minds of masses well I guess the first answer is because they're the CIA the second answer is because in the 1950s and the 1960s at the height of the Cold War the United States government were fearful that the Soviets and the Chinese people were using mind control to brainwash U.S prisoners of war in Korea they were so fearful of this that they said well we then should be controlling the minds of people that's so that's what they started to do they started a program which involved more than 150 human experiments with psychedelic drugs paralytics and electric electroshock therapy now sometimes the subjects knew that they were being experimented on other times they completely didn't kind of notoriously you guys might be familiar with Whitey Bulger he talked about how when he was in prison they were doing these experiments on the inmates and all of the crazy things that they would see as they were being dosed with LSD they began experimenting with LSD under the direction of a chemist and a poison expert named Sydney Gottlieb and he believed that the agency could harness the drugs mind-altering properties for brainwashing or psychological torture think about this this is this is really crazy there was an operation a project under MK Ultra that was called operation midnight climb Max and what did they do well the CIA paid prostitutes to drug unsuspecting men and they thought that this was a perfect audience to do this too because the men would be so ashamed that they were with a prostitute that they wouldn't then say something terrible happened to me or report it to police officers and they didn't just observe this by talking to the prostitute after she had drugged them and say hey what happened they actually created a room this Tia put together a room in one of their notorious safe houses and they actually had the experiments take place behind a two-way mirror they were watching it live imagine you're a CIA agent and you're paying a prostitute and this person this unsuspecting man thinks he's going to sleep with a prostitute in reality he has stepped into a CIA safe house and there are some agents behind the wall that are watching him and seeing how he reacts to being drugged with LSD that actually took place your government did this and you should know that you should know that because it got worse than that they were also drugging people that were in hospitals unsuspectingly and probably most notoriously they were drugging one another the CIA just at the day at the office typical day at the office would slip LSD into one of their agents coffees to see how he would react to it I say it's that part was rather notorious because that actually led to the death of one individual his name was Frank Olson Frank Olson was a scientist who worked for the CIA and at a 1953 CIA Retreat he drank a cocktail that had been secretly spiked with LSD but what happened well just a few short days later he tumbled to his death from the window of a New York City hotel room in an alleged suicide that seems a little bizarre but don't think too much of it that would make you a conspiracy theorist it's totally normal that they were unwittingly drugging people with LSD all the time now why am I bringing this up to today why is this on my mind today well if you want to know how that concludes there was Congressional hearings don't you guys love Congressional hearings it's like the government wants you to think that they're doing something to change things like we're going to have a congressional hearing to show it this is unacceptable Hillary Clinton what happened with these emails no comment no comment nothing happens ever well same idea when the CIA gets caught doing stuff they had Congressional hearings they declined to answer a lot of questions said that they didn't remember anything and that was it supposed to believe that the program magically ended well of course the government's interest in controlling the minds of the masses did not end there we know there were other programs like operation Mockingbird in which CIA agents were littered throughout the mainstream media so knowing that they're interested in influencing your ideas it is of course a natural conclusion that they are interested in controlling Hollywood right do you really think it's a coincidence that everybody that's in Hollywood that has a platform is in lockstep in all their opinions they there's no variation in opinions you know what they think because they have a platform right they are my body my choice and they supported Hillary Clinton throughout the election and every time they're angry about anything they're all posting black squares and everything just feels like somebody's just calling them up and saying do this right now I was thinking about this today because I watched an old clip of Dave Chappelle Dave Chappelle I'm not talking about his recent Saturday Night Live performance but I'm talking about Dave Chappelle if you don't recall this I'm going to remind you of back when we were told the public was told that Dave Chappelle was crazy that he had a mental break you remember these articles that started to appear you may be kind of foggy here and going yeah I do kind of remember that Dave Chappelle disappeared for a while and it turned out that he went to Africa he just up and went to Africa and walked away from a 50 million dollar contract and so I was reminding myself of this and going when did he sort of arrive back like why did now suddenly he's hosting SNL again he's being accepted back into the good graces of Hollywood he's got Netflix deals not a typical Arc for somebody who's just we've been told is mentally crazy so what what happened what changed and I found this old interview between him and Oprah it took place in 2006 after he left and he is talking about why he left right right in this interview he's talking about how there were all these weird pressures where suddenly there were individuals that were trying to encourage him as a black man to wear a dress like there was this he thought it was a bit weird and he thought there was some sort of a conspiracy because he was like no I don't want to wear this dress but they kept wanting him to put on a dress and he thought that was weird and he was under a lot of pressure and he was arguing with Executives not just about the dress but about the content that he was producing he was in the spotlight and then something even more bizarre happens right they essentially start leaking stories about him in the press that aren't true so at first they start saying that he has pneumonia and then they start saying that he's ha he has writer's block but don't let me tell you I want you to actually listen to Dave Chappelle in his own words speaking to Oprah in 2006. take a listen I still haven't gotten to why you just disappeared so you had that moment the guy's laughing too much was that the Tipping Point for you is that the straw that was the first Tipping Point okay and then they put in the paper that I had uh pneumonia God knows what it was walking pneumonia because I was walking all over the place uh I was relaxing uh and then after that I I was coming back to the show and uh then they were like well Dave you know you should just back up the pneumonia store and I was like I'm you know that was your thing I'm not I'm not backing up a pneumonia story so so pause there so that's interesting immediately because what he's saying is that they just inserted a story about him that wasn't true right they're just so just say you have pneumonia just back up this claim let's continue and hear what else he says and then the next day was in the paper that I had writer's block then I knew something was getting ready to get stressful because I hadn't even started writing it was I was on schedule to write so I was like what's you know what's going on are they going so these are your people trying to feed manipulate me sounds like somebody's trying to put young Dave in a compromising position okay so that's interesting he's speaking about handlers this idea of Hollywood handlers that are trying to manipulate the narrative trying to control some sort of a narrative and he's he's wise to it he's realizing wait a second something's going on here let's keep going but you know okay so now I got worse so when I say I'm not going to do it then all of a sudden I was like well now he is walking pneumonia and then I knew long before I walked I had considered walking you had considered I had to consider walking because I went back to work and the vitamin love was gone because it was a real ugly negotiation it's a situation where now everybody's taking credit for this and that and the others all it's just it was getting ridiculous and I knew I was going to leave so I got a head of schedule and I bounced and I didn't tell anybody where I was going the whole time they trying to convince me I'm insane stop right there he's essentially telling us that he escaped he just got up and he left because he realized that this was a toxic situation and they were trying to convince him that he was insane let's keep going they were trying to get me to take psychotic medication yeah like I'm sitting around you know I was stressed out but the people that were telling me I was insane I believe that they knew what's going on so uh this was Troublesome yeah so I'm not taking this medicine man because I know these people be trying to control you or or maybe this credit I was afraid like but you were stressed out that's right no question but is very stressful for someone to constantly walk behind you and say you're insane wow so just to recap there okay he's not able to be controlled and he's pushing back against Executives and then all of a sudden he starts to realize that there are Stories being leaked about him in the Press first suggesting that he has pneumonia it's not true then suggesting that he has writer's block then he starts having a bunch of people around him telling him that he's crazy trying to convince him that he's crazy and trying to get him to take psychotic medications why would they do that and what Dave Chappelle is being really clear here about is that he felt that they were involved in this narrative the people around him were colluding essentially to present this narrative but he was crazy to try to get him to take the medicine and he's very clear that when a bunch of people keep telling you that you're crazy you'll start to question your own sanity you'll start to wonder hey what is going on here am I crazy I think it's very telling and the reason why it's sent to chill down my spine is because I had heard this version of events very recently I have not been shy about the fact that I am friends with yay formerly known as Kanye West and he shared a very similar experience with me before this entire Fallout took place interesting fact about Kanye is that he's been in the public sphere since 1996. but Kanye West was never called crazy despite being in the public from 1996 all the way through to 2015 he was never called crazy ever by the media until he did what he put on the Mac hat he put on a red hat and said that he wanted to support Donald Trump for president he likes Donald Trump for president and then what happened well he was told by a person that was very close to him that in order to get his life back right he needed to just say that he was crazy so a close friend of his that close friend is Harley pastern at Carly pasternik is a trainer to the Stars right he trains all of the stars all of the celebrities he trained Brittany Murphy remember her she was we were told she was crazy and then she wound up dead and he was involved in her documentary while he trained Kanye West he was a friend of his he said Kanye you're actually you're not a conservative you don't support the Maga movement actually what's wrong with you is um you're having a psychotic break you should take some psychotic medicines and it was Harley pasternik that then called 9-1-1 and had Kanye sent to the hospital and it was hardly passionate that then leaked that to TMZ that Kanye West was having a mental break you guys remember that right and then suddenly we were all told that he has bipolar disorder and he believed it he believed that something was wrong with him like obviously everyone around him is saying You couldn't possibly like Donald Trump so he believed that he was bipolar right and so it's interesting to consider Harley pasternick why is Harley Patrick an interesting character well the first thing is his background Harley pasternik actually served as a scientist at the Department of National Defense DND defense and civil Institute for environmental medicine that is um they support the Canadian Armed Forces okay so he was a scientist for two years at drdc Toronto a military research station that is part of the DND the drdc researches human systems integration social and psychological factors that affect the resolution of conflict psychology of malicious intent and social and cultural factors influencing Behavior could be relevant could also not be relevant but it's interesting that he then becomes a trainer and he's got this background and then he encourages Kanye West to take medicine and has him committed to the hospital because he put on a Maga hat now all of that of course could be oh well whatever maybe Harley thought that Kanye really was having an episode and was just trying to help his friend except recently and what's really interesting about this is that the Press has been completely silent on it Harley pashnik made another appearance this time it was on Kanye's Twitter feed when he was going after various people in his life Kanye tweeted that he was misdiagnosed right and his friend Harley Patrick misdiagnosed him back in 2016. and Connie also shared um his exactly it was what should be obvious by now is that I was raised to stand for my truth regardless of consequences so I will say this again I was mentally misday diagnosed and nearly drugged out of my mind to make me a manageable well-behaved celebrity I'm sorry what in case you think he's just saying that and he's just being crazy because that sounds crazy what do you mean they were just gonna drug you to make you to manage you that sounds insane in case you think it's crazy he also shared a text from Harley pasternik a recent text from Harley passionate this is what Harley pasternik wrote to Kanye I'm going to help you one of a couple of ways first you and I sit down and have a loving and open conversation but you don't use cuss words and everything that is discussed is based in fact and not some crazy stuff that dumb friend of yours told you or you saw in a tweet second option this is where it gets interesting I have you institutionalized again where they medicate the crap out of you and you go back to Zombieland forever play date with the kids just won't be the same that is written to him by his I guess somebody's just helping him at the gym his trainer I'll have you institutionalized again I'll send you back to Zombieland talking about drugging a man so he doesn't recognize his own children and the media has stayed radio silent on this so that to me is the conspiracy why on Earth would the media remain radio silent on the fact that Harley passionate is openly admitting that he had something to do with Kanye being institutionalized once and he's threatening to do it again in what world is that legal again that uh there are a lot of questions that should be asked and we should have the courage to ask them because it is getting very scary out there and we are starting to recognize that our government is involved in way more than we could have ever imagined alright guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Trump who may be making a very big announcement tonight and I maybe received an invite so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "5EtoBLuw5_o": "joining me now is Eric finman he is one of the youngest Bitcoin Millionaires and the creator of the freedom phone which you may have seen me promoting recently Eric thank you for being here welcome to the show thank you we're going to get to the freedom phone but actually you're really fascinating for a lot of other reasons so I kind of just kind of want to delve into the history of Eric finman first and foremost how old are you I'm 22 I'm an old man you're 22 years old which is incredible um and you kind of placed a bet on cryptocurrency so first if you could just for viewers describe what cryptocurrency is when you took that chance and why you thought that cryptocurrency was going to be a lucrative investment absolutely cryptocurrency is one of the the most amazing inventions of the 21st century it allows you to carry all your wealth on something that's the size of the USB stick a USB stick and it's just an incredible invention not to have to rely on the Government Federal Reserve or corrupt governments like in Venezuela uh you know and America and America and all that because they mess with your bank accounts here and we've had friends that that's happened to um America has a history of doing that actually uh and then yeah so it's an amazing invention and can also be a good investment for some people and that's I got to do it when I was 12 years old 12 years old I mean what kind of a 12 year old were you a weird one I guess because some kids had video games some kids had Sports mine was Bitcoin wow that is incredible so you kind of had that mindset already kind of focusing on what was going to happen in the future and I actually read something that freaked me out and I'm probably going to talk more about my next episode but they were kind of running you know they do these sort of they run a simulation at the world economic forum and they said well what would happen in a scenario where the electricity went down you had no access to your bank accounts no access to your phones no access to anything and I thought to myself the idea that a cyber pandemic could happen and you could have no access to your money is actually a very very scary concept and a very scary idea and it does sort of feel like the federal government is kind of assuming a lot of control right now yeah I mean that's very true I mean that's why I am the most pro-bitcoin person most Pro crypto currency as a whole person ever because they can just yeah as soon as they want to they can freeze your money and uh and make it so you know you can't move anything and and it's terrible so I mean I feel like some people are already going through uh uh you know a cyber pandemic at least win their money you know it's it's really bad like even just you know innocent people even non-political people are just getting their money's their money Frozen and this this isn't a problem Bitcoin and you see even on thanks denying people saying you're not allowed to bank here anymore because you're a conservative exactly exactly I mean it's uh Treme like I have so many friends that's happened too and it's it's incredibly sad and Incredibly sick and and uh yeah how much money did you make off of Bitcoin um so yeah I guess right now I have over 430 Bitcoin um so that's not too bad I guess whatever the current price is you can do the calculation what is that you have to do the calculation yeah through the calculation um that's a big number um what is I guess last time I checked it was around thirty thousand so let's make it 400. I don't know I think that that ends up being a lot like tens of millions tens of millions yeah and you miss about 12 years old uh yeah well I first got into it yeah exactly first got into it I mean Bitcoin was just a few dollars I went my older brother brought me into this protest and it was very much like a footloose like protest some a guy named Adam kokash was arrested for dancing at the Jefferson Memorial and he was one of the first political influencers at the time where he would pick little laws that were just outrageous and apparently highly illegal to dance at the Jefferson Memorial so he did he got body slammed um uh uh you know literally really that you could hear a video skull like crack on the on the floor and it was terrible and we went to all go protest that because it was it was awful but um and then you know they had Blackhawk helicopters at this protest where everybody just hundreds of people came to dance it blocked Blackhawk helicopters with people on the sides of the helicopters um uh with machine guns like it's like Vietnam and they had horse Riot police just all for people dancing um and then the middle of running from the police some guy he had this orange shirt on with a B on it that looked like a dollar sign and uh and I asked him what's that I was just 12 and he said he said it's Bitcoin man it's gonna end Wall Street bro and he ran off and uh 12 year old Eric was like whoa exactly exactly and my older brother and I we looked into it and went home and just that that became my obsession what does a parent do when like a 12 year old becomes a multi-millionaire um well I became multi-millionaire at 18 so 12 Bitcoin was just a few dollars um and all that and uh so it was it was it was Slim Pickens back then I was mowing lawns to be able to get more money to buy Bitcoin just because I I felt it was the next big thing and you know you might feel something next big thing but it's kind of like World Peace you wish for it to happen but you're never never quite sure it will um and then and then yeah I ended up turning out great I had I actually had enough money I dropped out of high school when I was 15. um I moved to Palo Alto to start actually an education startup in online school because I love learning but I just didn't like the school I was at and uh so I ended up doing that in exchange for my parents allowing me to do that I made a bet with my parents they said you have to go back to school if uh if you don't make a million dollars by the time you're 18 you have to go back and and I won the bet at 18 I crossed about 2 million dollars at 18 and then and then Bitcoin is done done well ever since it is interesting interesting one that seems to drop out of school if you think of people that control the world it's all dropouts right I mean like the the most successful people in Silicon Valley Jack Dorsey was notoriously a Dropout Bill Gates was a Dropout um Steve Jobs is a Dropout you're a Dropout and and yet we have this push where they keep saying your kids need to go to school but need to go to school and those kids are coming out and they're becoming government puppets it's almost like schools don't teach you to think outside of the box they very much are designed to make sure that you always remain within the Box absolutely I mean and that's why I didn't like like high school and and those were College dropouts I did High School Richard Branson also did that he dropped out at 15 out of high school right and founders of Google that dropped out of uh Stanford yeah they dropped out of Stanford and everything and uh yeah I mean that it just feels that school is made um without uh giving I feel like the human race a lot of respect right um they they just kind of uh treat you like you're the lowest common denominator like they treat you like you're just a sheep and and that you know you just need to inject not even high quality information just low quality information and then you know you come out and who was it um that said it was like some people are going into school and leaving school knowing less than what they did when they joined right and uh and I thought that was very true and I just felt like I love learning and and the school is going to kill my love for Learning and if I had stayed I dropped out the beginning of my sophomore year uh and if I'd stayed the rest of the year another year I I would have never I just would have been just like a vegetable I wouldn't have been who I am so was it fair to assess you as somebody who has been suspicious of the government for a very long time and kind of have seen that the government could assume too much power yeah I mean I grew up in North Idaho so that was the very that was the the predominant opinion so um uh but yeah I mean I think it's really shocked me and I I feel like you know growing up my my parents would put Rush Limbaugh on and that was my lullaby so I mean that that was they would read me and ran before I went to sleep instead of like the Little Red Hen or something right um that's actually true great parents yeah I was always I was made for this I guess um but uh uh but yeah I mean I I think recently seeing how they treat banking has been terrible I mean before it's kind of like you could go seek it out the the authoritarianism um like you know breaking a dancing law but recently it's just uh it's been so shocking to me how extreme they're going right yeah and you've also examined a relationship between Wall Street and the regulators and you've seen that corruption because you were involved and I honestly found out about this two days ago with Wall Street bets that Reddit feed that essentially collapsed a large hedge fund can you talk a little bit about what wall Street's bets were how you got involved what it is the case viewers are not aware because that was the biggest story for a very long time yeah absolutely so Wall Street bets was see they're they're not just censoring you political conservatives on a social media they're censoring anyone that challenges The Establishment in the current regime team and and Wall Street bets was this basically this community kind of like there was red at the Donald um and that you know a community of trump supporters and there was Reddit Wall Street bets um and uh and that was that was a whole community of people that basically said hey let's let's trade stocks together and share tips and share memes and be funny and and let's let's uh and then they ended up like a lot of these people were kind of children they're growing up and now have Financial power for the first time so they decide to invest in things like GameStop because that was their childhood place where they went and uh AMC and these were all companies that were were huge parts of these people's childhoods um but ended up kind of going out of business due to these like big larger you know uh hedge funds gobbling everything up and shorting different companies um to uh you know make sure that they fail and they basically said hey let's put all our money in GameStop or you know that we have in the stock market and then the price shot up and bankrupted um or or close to bankruptcy these massive hedge funds that have been around for decades um so it shows that it's not just conservatives it's just um it's it's even people that are just and any any entity that goes against the establishment it's that we have to ban you off social media because they got good at Banning accounts but now they're they've gotten starting to get good at Banning ideas wow and did you were you a part of the people that invested in GameStop Yes make some good money there too yes I made some good money on games you just tell me where to invest so I can like just do that I'll just follow you can be my person that tells me where to invest and I'll just do it absolutely absolutely", "1HTyyaddEmE": "speaking of this responsibility that women have in society and I always say that it's going to be up to us to get Society back on its tracks and it's why I'm often speaking about the extreme things that women are doing and for whatever reason it seems that social media is a special place where women compete to be more and more extreme in their actions for attention so it started with women saying okay I'm on social media and I want attention then it said I'm on social media and to get attention I'm going to take all my clothes off okay I'm on social media and to get attention it's not enough for me to just take my clothes off I'm also going to start getting procedures online right we talked about your psychological immune system in previous episodes being broken down because of social media because it tells you that you need to be more and more extreme and because you're becoming more extreme because you're trying to find a community and so I spoke to you about these women that now just go on Instagram and cry they literally just they cry as soon as they have a feeling they go and they cry and they're doing that because they want likes right there's this dopamine hit you're getting a like and you're being extreme you're being extremely unstable and so you cry try and so social media is encouraging the psychological breakdown and it's encouraging you to want to be more extreme so that another community of people can find you and go wow she's so brave look she's not just on social media she's not just naked on social media but she's naked and she's crying and like like like like what can I do to be even more extreme than that incredibly Brave woman well Savannah blew in I was a 22 year old woman heard the call and she is here to answer it how can you be more extreme on social media what about saying I don't want kids now you might be thinking yes that's not that that's not that extreme who cares there's a whole community of people on Reddit who don't want kids yeah but Savannah's figured out a way to get attention from that she has decided to get a surgery to have her Fallopian tubes extracted from her body still not enough you're thinking yeah people get their tubes tied okay but do people ask to take their Fallopian tubes home and turn them into a piece of jewelry yeah because that is what Savannah has done it not only has Savannah blue and done this but she is obviously documenting that she created a necklace out of her tubes saying that the creation makes her feel empowered oh wow she said quote I had my Fallopian tubes removed because I've always known that I never want to have children the vegan restaurant waitress felt inspired to make a necklace following the decision to overturn the court case Roe v Wade talk about an absolute Psychopathic response to overturning a Supreme Court case and simply saying that all machine Universal abortion by sending it back down to the States and this woman is so distraught that she decides that the best way to respond to this legal matter is to have our Fallopian tubes removed and to be put in to jewelry and to speak out and talk about that on tick tock so yeah she's from Connecticut which is where I'm from and I'm very embarrassed she's from Connecticut and she posted a video on her Tick Tock that has since gone viral take a listen so a lot of people said this and a lot of people also grouped together and said a couple other things and those couple other things where they're going to mold in the resin you should have sent them to pathology so you know if you're gonna get sick and three is how do I get so lucky so I am going to use you uh to lobato uh to answer those questions so yeah they are a little I was expecting them to be bigger as well because I had Googled it and it said it was gonna be four inches each uh and they are not so I don't know if it's because they're no longer hydrated and they got a little scrunchy um I know they shrunk a tiny bit because I put them in the refrigerator for one night um so maybe they were bigger when they came out but yeah they're they're pretty tiny um the other thing was that people wanted to make sure that I sent them to pathology I did I got them back from pathology that's how I got them um so what I did is I asked my surgeon if I could keep them she said probably not and I said I want to make them to jewelry and she was like oh I'll ask pathology that sounds sick and so she had asked and they had originally said no but I didn't even know that um because before I got an answer back I had already written a letter and sent it to them that said um essentially I looked at the laws in my state and I know exactly where my rights begin and end regarding this I am tremendously lucky to have been able to get the surgery um I don't deny that one bit I am 22 years old and I happen to live in Connecticut which is a very safe state for women right now I'm really lucky in that sense but regarding the getting the tubes back um that was just because I was self-advocating and I did my research um and I was you know I was very determined about it um and most of the time if you say you know I'm well aware of my rights um I've already done the research they're not going to want to deal with you um I don't have the money to sue anybody but I made it sound like I did so that's how I got them back so if anyone has any other questions feel free to come in and ask and I'll make a video or if you want to look at my Instagram I documented the entire process of my surgery if you're looking to get this done so my Instagram is salve blue in I'm gonna put it on my hand right here um so there it's a public account and the Highlight is called No tubes no problem and all the information that I have essentially was on there but if you still have questions you can DM me if you'd like also if you look at that highlight you'll see a picture of the letter that I wrote to pathology if you want a template to threaten your local Pathology Department also I almost didn't say The Moldy thing um if they're going to get moldy they're going to get moldy they're already in resin I can't do anything so there you have it if you think it is dramatic to say that we are living in the times of Satan then I urge you to rewind this podcast and listen to that again just listen to her casually speaking on Tick Tock a 22 year old girl about how she just ruined her life she just just to sex she just sacrificed her body literally to a narrative right they told her the world was over and she wasn't going to be able to get an abortion and kill her own kids so what did she do she removed her Fallopian tubes that is how committed she is to the ideology that is how she is committed to The Cult of the left right she's literally sacrificing her own body and she's so willing to do it that she jumped on Tick Tock documented it and to encourage always to do it and then you think okay well at least the people seeing this will tell her that she's crazy and satanic but if that's what you're thinking you're wrong you're absolutely wrong the comments are favorable Alyssa writes to her why did you have the surgery was just a personal choice super cool that you kept them oh really oh okay Artemis writes hey State neighbor Alex writes the fact that you have to ask to keep a part of you like the fact that she even had to write a letter to request her Fallopian tubes back that is what has Artemis shook not the fact that she literally had her Fallopian tubes removed for a narrative she's not she's she's just like I don't even want to think about having children I'm 22 years old forget the fact that my brain is not even fully developed forget the fact that I have no idea how I'm going to feel if I meet somebody and fall in love I did this because I don't know the media told me that I should be enraged that the world was over and so I did it I was brainwashed where this person's parents are I don't know I literally don't know where this girl's parents are but these are how the comments are her Serena same thing what I find insane is that they could tell you know it all like they effing belong to you they're your fallopian tubes they were inside of you nobody else should have a say which I guess makes sense because these people are basically saying that that is why you have right to kill a baby anything that's inside of you you have a right to kill and you know what there are the fact that they wouldn't give it back to her is a problem she this psychopath probably thinks he should be able to request an abortion and then get the baby back right after you abort it this is how sick and demented this world has become I tell you on the show all the time to keep your kids off of tick tock it is so obvious to me that Tick Tock is driving our society into a very very very dark place and it is just not worth it to have this chatter if you're a child reading this and you're thinking oh this is normal this is totally normal all the comments are supporting this girl like this guy this is so cool thousands of years from now geologists will discover your fallopian tubes preserved like dragonflies in Amber that's a real comment that is a real comment under the fact that this girl just mutilated her own body I get I I am I just I'm so disgusted I have to stop talking about this because it's going to make me angry and I am practicing happiness on this Friday all right guys that is all in regards to the comments you know the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you are not a number yet go ahead click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "ZZqzbXMxw_8": "so you went viral maybe unexpectedly for some comments that you made after a fight and I actually want to run that clip because it was sort of amazing let's watch it I want to thank my Lord see hey calm down calm down number two I want to dedicate this fight for all the people who've been hurt by Marx's ideologies there are millions of you and I know it and uh it's Justified I know it's not much but I want you to know that I love you and I understand the pain that's incredible that is incredible what possessed you to I mean thanking Jesus Christ of course what possessed you to then dedicate it to and especially right now with what's going on in Cuba to the millions of people that are suffering under Marxist regimes well there's a couple of things the Catalyst to it was uh Thug Rose I don't know if you were familiar with her she came up she just became Champion again she was uh she fought uh Wei Ling Zhang and she came out and said uh better dead than red and she her family's I believe it was a Lithuanian and they that was their slogan better dead than red and she got a terrible backlash and I just couldn't understand it like she's not saying anything crazy you don't want communism you don't want this socialism this is what destroys countries and lives so I I saw how the media played it they they turned the they turn and they say it like you know communism it's not even an issue in America things like that and uh and and they kind of put a lot of pressure on her and I actually felt bad for her I was like she should be able to say that as much as she wants and pretty much everybody should so with that being said I said I'm I was gonna actually just gonna say the same thing she said but the issue is it's the way they play with words so you say communism they say well we're not really talking about comments and we're talking about socialism and you say socialism they say well it's not that kind of socialism it's this and I just said Marxism it covers it all the only difference between these is is one of them is a slower poison that's going to kill you later on and one of them just kills you fat the other one kills you faster so I just I think we got to make sure we start calling it just Marxism and it's all one you don't you don't get to say no it's this you don't get to say it's all the same thing right I mean wrote a book and this is Marcus ideology he was talking about taking a country that was capitalist using socialism as a trans story transitory State and turning it into a communist state and people don't understand those steps and you are so correct that if you start with talking about Marxism the ideology right and and the thought processes the institutions that are practicing this Marx ideologies people might have a better grasp of what it is we're talking about interesting that you say that you know she's from Lithuania because there is this thing that the West we have been blessed for so long that we don't know what socialism is we don't know what Marxism is and people come here from the East and they're like are you crazy do you understand the cancer that we are talking about you're from Iran and has that sort of been something that has sort of tethered you to uh you know oppressions that people can live in that's one thing my my wife is Vietnamese so her parents are from Vietnam and they ran away from Marxism they they ran away from from that and they told me the stories her father basically came on a boat and he would tell us like nine out of ten didn't make it he was one of one of the 10 boats that did make it so there's that and then the stories her mom would tell me about how they got out of the house last minute if they had stayed an extra day they would be in in a camp or they'd be in prison or whatever it was so I hear those stories and then in my country the the Ayatollah came and they promised all these free things and they said just let us take over and we're going to do all this stuff for you and they became they made the government God and it's the same it's it's no different it's Marx's ideology you make government number one and people give up their rights and from there we're gonna have vast Improvement and prosperity and all that and that it never comes because people don't realize the people who fight capitalism right now and they hate they say oh this big Corporation you this big corporate Corporation has a little bit of power because at the end of the day you could say I'm not going to buy from you and so you kill its power the government once it takes power nobody takes that away you don't take it if it's if it's gained freely it'll be taken back in blood that's the only way you get away from communism Marxism wow say it again yeah that sentence if it's gained freely it will be taken the only way you're going to get it back is in blood and I this is it's been over and over it's it's proven that that's that's historical you can see it in history it is such great news that President Donald Trump is suing the big Tech Lords to fight back against big Tech's control of the internet I use expressvpn ever wondered how free to access Tech Giants make all their money well

is in the late stage 60 years later and their people are starving and they're fighting you know just to be free and it's interesting to see our media kind of spin that around like you said what are you talking about it's not happening here don't don't even look over here yeah so Cuba went the traditional route when it comes to uh Marxism the the the leaders they they believed in it so they they pushed it on the people and the idea is you're gonna teach this ideology and and the people will wake up and recognize and they're gonna say this is the best thing for us so it was the traditional way of going after it uh getting the leaders to believe in it and they're gonna they're gonna project it onto the people in America we're doing a little bit differently we're starting from the bottom and working our way top which is it's a longer process but it's a lot scarier so they've gotten into obviously media schools and slowly they're just pushing it on us and we didn't even know it until now in last couple of years it's been it's right in front of us this whole time well I love you as an athlete because I think that you hit on such important topics uh you know faith family I talk about it every single day individualism uh working hard these are elements that I think really uh are elements that keep a country free and so seeing you thank Jesus Christ that's amazing we don't see that anymore seeing the fact that you understand the opportunities of this beautiful country that's amazing but also you recently posted something on your social media that I thought was so sweet and I I do want to show that as well you said I've been waiting my whole life to be a father and I didn't even know it I praise God for you um Alva all glory to God beautiful little girl we both just became parents yeah yeah we both just became parents I'll ask you how has that transformed your life it was you know people are like oh you're not gonna sleep good this is gonna be thing the blah blah blah they made it sound so stressful it's been the best thing I come home and I see her and I could be tired or not tired and I'm like I'm fine I got this like oh diaper change no problem I'll I'll do it like before I used to think diaper changes were the scariest thing ever and it's just not no issue now we I'm on it I at night they always scared you with sleep you're not gonna sleep honestly I don't sleep much anyways so it was it's been perfect every day my family comes over to hold her and then I'll get her at night and she's wide awake at night she's like eyes open staring at me so we just have the best time every night and then I get great sleep because she helps me calm down and just have a plan there is something about that and you're so right that people try to convince you it's oh it's going to be terrible we've kind of developed this very anti-familial sentiment in the country um and it's interesting because I could be having the worst day ever it's actually the kids are beautiful in this way I can be dead tired and my son had a bad night a couple of weeks ago the second they look at you and they smile it's just there's it's a melt in terms of the worries in your life in a way that you can't explain it there's something so precious and sacred about children about babies about family there really is and I was watching uh earlier when you were talking about uh I think it was Harry and Megan is that yeah right and I just thought to myself how Wild is that China forced that on on its people and people don't know this they have about half a billion abortions nearly they're come up they're probably around that number half a billion abortion but you know what the saddest part is most of them were girls do you know why because the girls can't carry on the family name so most of the abortions in China were women yeah that's exactly right and and what's interesting is that I guess it took them a while to figure out that Society doesn't keep going on when you decide to just yeah they figured it out but that's the crazy thing like I said over there the leaders forced it on us now we're doing it willingly because the ideology is slowly seeping into every part of our life culture yeah and this sort of gets back to why I think UFC is taking off because you know there's almost a corporate culture where the corporations have sort of said this is the new message right this is the new message the messages it's more responsible not to have family and unfortunately we have children that aren't strong on their two feet and they believe in everything that their Idols say and they take it unquestioningly you know the education system is really a wash and I think that that is sort of the reason why they go oh well then like this celebrity said this so I must think that and they see Hollywood has become so toxic I think I couldn't agree more I mean right now Sports if and the thing is I know there's a lot of athletes who don't agree with that in all of these sports but they can't say anything and not just athletes let's talk about schools I have friends who are teachers and they're a little bit older if they speak on it they're going to be forced out so the Old Guard is going to go no matter what and if they speak out they'll they go faster and and if they don't eventually they're going to retire and the new new guards coming in same thing for example comic books we have friends who who uh in comics and I love comics and it's it's completely changed now okay what is it I would say um one percent of the population would be part of the LGBT uh Community they're making three out of the four characters in in comic books now uh part of the LGBT community and it just doesn't make sense and and they're not selling because my friends tell me they're not selling they're getting less work so so what why why are we doing this and it's just it's it's their religion now it's their ideology thanks for joining me on this episode of canvas if you

information at this point the doctor said oh i do not have any trans patients and i don't know anything about that but then proceeded to ask questions such as have you researched people who regret transitioning no no i haven't because that's not really my concern right now my concern is to make sure my child doesn't turn into a statistic and alive herself honestly this one makes me super upset because in this scenario the doctor should have probably called child protective services um a child like saying saying that there's a child who thinks it's trans it's like saying there's a dog that thinks it's vegan you know who's making the decision children don't think like this there is a mother that needs to be removed from the care of that child", "w3xSrICFGPs": "keep telling you your kid has Tick Tock get them off I'm gonna say that until I'm blue in the face if your children are on Tick Tock pull them off I'm making it a song because I think that's what Tick Tock is it's people singing and dancing and making things that are actually horrible and horrific appeal to children so now we have a transgendered another mentally ill tick tocker that has just gotten a hysterectomy a hysterectomy not only they have a hysterectomy they have decided that they're going to turn it into a science project and display it in a jar for children to see how cool it is to mutilate Your Body by choice here's the video trigger warning yeah so in this hey y'all so I just got my uterus back and it looks so freaking cool trigger warning this has an organ and it is a wet specimen and it is my uterus plus the tubes as well so ready for the reveal this is it this is my uterus she scrubbed off all the blood that is my cervix that's what a cervix looks like y'all and these little strings right here are my Fallopian tubes but this is my uterus this is it compared to my head this little thing causes so much problems for everybody and I also got a LED plug-in LED stand with it so it lights up different color and Spins while it displays it which is so cool despite the trigger warning that this person provided I am still triggered I am triggered as a mother that is raising children in a sick Society I mean could you imagine that this is permissible on the web and yet we are being told that people like Donald Trump and people like Yay Kanye West are dangers that they are dangerous human beings right that they are not allowed to be on the internet and yet this is a person that is just mutilated their own body and is intentionally trying to make it seem like a cool aspect by putting it on the web and showing a bunch of children that they can do it too you can put it in a jar look oh my gosh it's my fallopian tool my fallopian tubes now I will never be able to become pregnant because I just had a doctor a doctor that should be in prison do this to me because of how I was feeling on the inside and the reason that I was probably feeling about this way on the inside is because I have some underlying trauma or underlying sadness or underlying need for attention best evidence by the fact that I am on Tick Tock looking for likes and views for my Fallopian tubes that I'm putting on the web right that's what's going on this is a person that needs attention and for attention people are becoming more and more extreme they're pretending that they have gender identity issues because they like that it gives them a false Community online this is sick right you should feel disgusted when I first saw this video I did not want to eat after it and yet we still have parents who think that their children being on Tick Tock is absolutely fine it's not fine I stand strongly against this we are not going to be able to survive as a society if we do not address this and call it what it is on its face all right it is mental illness I said in my George Floyd documentary and I'm going to say it again we have to have the courage to scream the truth louder than they scream the lies learn to like Meghan Markle it's weird like now I'm enjoying her like first she frustrated me and made me angry but now I'm enjoying her because I'm curious I'm suspenseful I'm at the edge of my seat trying to figure out how many times one woman can tell you she's been victimized and Meghan Markle has been victimized again again no no not that time or the time before over time before that or the time before that time before that time again into the future the time after that the time just before it and the chime the time three weeks after today where she will also be victimized but this time was about after the fact for the first time Meghan Markle has again been victimized or something so um you remember the interview that she did in the cut magazine where she oh you're not gonna believe it she actually talked trash with the royal family I know she's never done that before but she did do it in the cut magazine interview and it created a firestorm of press but now she's giving another interview to the interview to basically say that she was a victim of the magazine article even though they quoted what she said she says now that she was just too trusting and open with the writer of that magazine uh where she once again said stuff against a royal family and she also hinted that the entire chat that she had with that author was never meant to address her feelings about the monarchy except she did address her feelings about the monarchy and the author wrote about her feelings about the monarchy and then she faced a bitter backlash over those feelings she was the cover of their August issue but it's somehow their fault that she said it she didn't mean to say it she did say it but it's the cuts Magazine's fault you guys get it right so anyways I'm putting together a list of all of the ways in which which Meghan Markle has been victimized and who has victimized her and I want you to know who Charmed Meghan Markle and I am committed to keeping this list first she was victimized by her own father she was also victimized by her own sister if you remember she was clearly victimized by the royal family despite the very little time that she spent with them she spoken out against the victimization that she is suffering because of climate change yes her and Harry are very involved and of course racism because she's going through that and she's a victim of racism all the time in case you forgot Meghan Markle was also a victim of a dish soap commercial when she was a small child she shared that moment um uh I think it was on her archetype podcast where she saw a commercial and the woman was washing dishes and she was like oh my God why is it a woman that's washing dishes that's victimization right there Meghan Markle at like 10 years old victimized by Dawn or Procter and Gamble soap whatever it was that's sad she was victimized by The Daily Mail she sued them remember they victimized her and just last week she was telling us that she was victimized by Deal or No Deal the first show that she was on and it was victimization because they objectified her which is really surprising because she took the job they told her that she was going to have to stay in a bikini and I guess after doing that for a while she decided that actually I'm a victim of accepting this job author and I offer in fact I'm actually a victim of having applied for the job why did I apply for this job I don't know probably because the people from the dealer No Deal are a bunch of misogynists and they objectified her and I feel sad she also of course now is a victim of the cut interview and I've heard that she might be a victim of a cat a Starbucks employee from 2014 who gave her her Latte when it was a little cold okay I made up the cat and the Starbucks thing but I think it's possible because as I said into the future there will be more instances in which Meghan Markle is victimized we just have to hang on and I am committed to maintaining this list I'm now with you Meghan Markle and I I can't believe that anybody hasn't seen how you have been suffering you have a little princess that has been suffering for a very long time and I'm glad that you have this entire podcast that is dedicated to how sad you are to be incredibly rich and married to a prince all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire

that is always naked on the internet because something something feminism something something something the patriarchy it's sexism it's classic misogyny it's always a classic sexism and classic misogyny no matter what if you have an opinion that is not in line with her as well good news guys Emily rochkowski has launched a podcast okay I'm saying launch maybe she always had one I wouldn't know but her podcast is called is called high low and recently she had a conversation with Julia Fox Julia Fox I actually all I know is that she is a mother who dated Kanye for like two weeks is trying to spin this into a career and Emily has hosted her because I don't know she is all about being sexy and naked and girl power or something and they recently discussed their one-year-olds or their children rather Emily discussed her one-year-old he is a boy and here is what these two ladies had to share with one another my morning routine I like bring science I make him breakfast whatever and then I get in the shower inside comes with me and then when I get dressed and like do my makeup he's just chilling playing around me so now he does it he'll put on my clothes he'll play with the makeup but yeah it's so crazy Sly like loves trucks and oh my God Valentino loves Trump okay well they need another reason freaks out freaks out he stops everything he's doing he's like whoa whoa his fly literally is like oh oh oh it's like so excited loves to play with things with the wheels and I'm like I I'm not kidding this morning I ordered him a baby doll and a tea set because I'm like we gotta like bounce out but also like is this just what he likes well naturally loves pushing around a little stroller with a doll in it okay yeah yeah yeah and and I bought him pink truck oh so I have a pink convertible thing okay yeah so that's cute you know I don't know I'm like are those the little ways that you can start to help with the condition like making sure that the conditioning doesn't happen so yeah yeah so essentially they're diagnosing their little boys with being little boys I know they just love trucks they just every time he just actually naturally likes trucks because he is a biological male and I have a one-year-old also and he loves drugs never because we conditioned him to do anything right he just eats a truck and just like she's describing he goes oh wow every time he sees one and every time we're driving and he sees one he stops and makes a big face because I have a little boy right and there are differences biological differences between boys and girls that is just the truth women are born little girls when they grow up they want to have Barbie dolls so what she's essentially saying is there's something wrong with my little boy because he's acting like a little boy and so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to diagnose that as being I don't know incar correct something's wrong with that and I'm going to Instead try to condition him to act like a little girl and so she's going to buy him a baby doll and she's going to say okay it's enough when playing with the truck play with the doll okay it's enough I see that you're really drawn to that naturally here is a pink truck he's just you should like pink because you're a boy or something I mean you just need to I just need to get this out of you this boy thing you're doing I mean this is what I'm talking about when I say that crazy parents create crazy children right Emily Wachowski is crazy I know that she's getting a divorce and I hope that her husband her former husband I guess current husband is listening to this podcast and recognizing that this is what your son is going to be around someone that thinks that there's something wrong with him for being a boy right like she actually thinks this is something that she needs to try to fix because he's presenting symptoms of being a biological male absolutely and pointedly ridiculous and really allows you to see behind the curtain in terms of what we're talking about when we say that people in Hollywood are demented right it's constantly about virtue signaling right they need to Virtue they need to Signal it they have virtue and they can do this by destroying their children that's what she's doing and it's trash in my opinion all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire

"3fVegUDgGd4": "I have to cover this unfortunately actually not unfortunately fortunately I love covering Madonna I don't know there's just something about her I just I just and now enjoying her I heard Meghan Markle are firmly in the same camp I used to not like them but now I'm enjoying the crazy a little bit I'm on the journey with them and Madonna has posed a very thought-provoking question to her fans on Instagram she's asking this if you aren't someone the church would have killed 400 years ago are you even living and then she of course because she needs something to put with the caption shared some provocative photos of herself because hey the church would have killed me look at me in my undies look at me with my boobs out my church would have killed me I mean are you even living if a church wouldn't have killed you 400 years ago and I really do think that I don't more Madonna kind of what she should be asking herself whether is whether or not we should have as a society moved away from having insane asylum so she's just getting up there and getting crazier and I do believe that she is a victim of her own Fame and her own wealth I think Madonna has never been told no or it was a very long time ago when people around her told her no or that she shouldn't do things and she thinks that everything she does shows how free she is you know I can I'm free to be a pervert you know Matt Walsh my colleague says this all the time and he's so correct just because you can do something doesn't mean you should and for whatever reason people don't understand stand that and they think that everything that they can do they should do right I have the freedom to do this so I should do it and that isn't so it's not it's not it's not fighting for Freedom at all and to be honest let me just say this in conclusion when it comes to girls getting naked on the internet if you really really really want to shock me keep your clothes on because it's just you know we've got boobs and breasts everywhere it's so abundant it's just it's the most natural thing in the world almost to see on Instagram at this point if you really want me to go oh I can't believe she did that just wear a shirt speaking of covet shots and I'm not here to imply by the way how this happened or why this happened but we have all been recognizing that there have been a lot of sudden deaths that exact language that we weren't saying before kobit and now we're saying all the time to describe people are they're just dying suddenly and we're being told that it could be from pandemic stress or various other things and a lot of times we're not even being giving an explanation for why so many for just one as just one example healthy athletes are dropping dead right and they just oh he just had a heart attack at 30. this is totally normal except then when you look at the data it's not normal we are having high incidences of people that are suddenly dying unexpectedly and the media is virtually ignoring it well as I said I cannot say that this death had anything to do with anything other than what Megyn Kelly actually says but she did announce the sudden death of her sister Suzanne Crossley during her podcast on Monday and I will allow you to hear Megan Kelly in her own words describing this tragedy something really sad happened in my family over the weekend um my sister died she was 58. her name was Suzanne Crosley and she died suddenly on Friday of a heart attack she hasn't been in very good health over the past couple of years just like sort of one problem after another so it was sudden and it was it was unexpected um and I went up got news of it after the show and went right up and was there with my mom and my brother Paul and my my nephew Brian one of her three kids when she passed so it was really hard it was extremely emotional my poor mom as you all as all moms and dads out there know this is not the order in which this is supposed to happen um so in any event we were all together over the weekend I'm going back up there after the show today and she will have her funeral tomorrow I know Megan Kelly she is a wonderful person honestly I've been on her show before I've worked with her I feel so sad that she's going through this and I just want to express my deepest condolences to her publicly stated something on Twitter but I also want to State it here and to extend those condolences to every single person who is having a circumstance where they're losing somebody suddenly and unexpectedly two heart attacks obviously her sister was very young and you can see how affected and impacted she is by this and it's something that I just wouldn't wish upon my worst anime so Megan Kelly we are all praying for you I mean that sincerely not as just something to say our team is praying for you and hoping that your family finds closure and strength during this horrible time alright guys I want to jump into this next story which is it's funny it is very funny when we talk about a trauma economy everyone's just looking for something to be sad about and they're looking for racism everywhere so a lot of times we just jump on boards and say that things are I don't know literally horrific and racist and backwards and they can't believe that we're seeing the state of politics today well that is exactly what Pete Dominic did in case you're wondering who Pete Dominic is he is a comedian allegedly except he wasn't being funny in this scenario and he's on the Last Week Tonight Show he was convinced that Ron DeSantis supporters were shouting refried beings at Democratic lieutenant governor of Florida nominee Carla Hernandez obviously Carlo Hernandez is Hispanic and he saw a video of people shouting towards her and he was convinced they were saying refried beans because everybody knows that if you don't like Spanish people what you should do is find them and say refried beans refried beans refried beans so he tweeted this with a video this was his tweet he says in case you hadn't seen this Santa's supporters shouting refried beans at Carla as she was walking into the theater for the debate sad state of politics to say the least that is sad that's ridiculous I can't believe we're just like yelling Spanish meals now at people we are we this is a racist backwards country I one time I've got to be honest I saw a Hispanic person I just said quesadillas tacos Tapas refried beans steep down it's what everybody does we're angry and racist except we don't because that's ridiculous it's really really stupid and he tweeted this out and of course it never happened and it turns out that what they were actually shouting these grown adult people was keep Florida free so I'm very sorry that this did not check out and that people are not crazy enough to shout menu items uh but it was a good narrative while it lasted moving on you guys we talk about Tick Tock option on this show I do not have a tick tock account I refuse to have a tick tock account I will never have a tick tock account because it's burning brain cells I'm telling you guys it is burning brain cells get your children off Tick Tock I say it often

"qHlzLHNZlko": "our purposes by saying that at the exact same time Alex Jones was trending on Twitter because he lost his uh defamation trial and they had determined that he needed to pay 965 million dollars for lies that he told regarding the Sandy Hook school shooting at the same time that Alex Jones was trending Pfizer was trending uh because it was determined that obviously they lied about whether or not if you got the Pfizer shot remember the initial push was you will be protected from the coronavirus and now they're like oh you won't be protected at all anyways that's trending you have the audacity to tweet Alex Jones lying and Pfizer lying both trending one with penalty the other without if you have no critical thinking faculties this is about as crazy as we should get before nuclear war wipes out the human race and then you followed It Up by saying if Alex Jones pays for lying should shouldn't every celebrity pushing the vaccines pay to makes so much sense that you had to get in trouble for that I mean where are we Drawing the Line you he can't lie about the shooting but people can lie and get people to shoot things into their body believing that it's going to provide them protection there are people that quite literally won settlements from Pfizer because they got had a heart attack a 15 year old I believe in um it was an Asian country who actually won a lawsuit against Pfizer completely healthy dropped I mean had a heart attack was fortunately revived all of these losses that are happening now people that are getting shingles the women that were lied to about who are gaslit for months who were saying they were having menstruation problems I've covered that in my show they were my friends that were saying they hadn't gotten a period or they couldn't stop bleeding then they quietly admitted that okay that could be it could happen but we weren't going to tell you initially because we just wanted you to roll up your sleeve and the people that got this did it because celebrities jumped on Instagram and it was like the black Square campaign right where do you donate to as a black Square so now you've got to donate to BLM none of it makes any sense but oh well this is why we have propaganda celebrities doing a bizarre dystopian thing and showing themselves getting shots this makes sense this makes sense and yet despite that making perfect sense you were slated to do a shoot with GQ an upcoming photo shoot with GQ and your publicist got this email yeah sadly I have some bad news uh vaccine to be I lost Vogue and then this second vaccine tweet I lost the GQ Man I was like a Vogue graveyard everybody canceled from Vogue I think should be my friend because I'm finding that there seems to be a threat a thread yeah you Vogue will cancel you if you tell the truth sort of a thing so first Vogue and then this GQ thing this email that went out to presumably your PR person says okay sadly I have some bad news in regards to the GQ award and our upcoming photo shoot Mia's current Twitter activity was brought to our attention and due to its controversial nature meaning well the first time I got I got denied I went mad and I went to and the first time I was denied the cover for Vogue was the day after Obama won um and that week he got the Nobel Peace Prize and I walked into the office and animentor was like what do you think about that and then I said oh he should give it back because he's only been in office for about a week he hasn't done anything why does he get a Peace Prize and so they pulled my cover in 210 so I've always had this relationship with Vogue and um yeah so I still kind of stick to that I don't think he should have got the Nobel Peace Prize when he hadn't done anything and I would say that if it was anybody becoming Middle Eastern countries at a rate that had never been seen before but peace what is peace what is peace so yeah I think that's kind of uh double-edged thing you know to to be judged on your cultural value of like being on the cover of if you are a propaganda if you agree to be a propagandist this is your award we'll put you on a cover and we'll make you more famous and all you have to do is sell your soul so my question for you is why didn't you sell yours you could be Madonna you could be a billionaire today you could be sitting cushy somewhere in Los Angeles and I guess it's the same reason my dad didn't you know my Dad could have done the same thing and it's just you just have to say what's true it's just not in my genetic makeup to have success at all costs you know and and also I do success differently I I don't view it in a monetary sense you know and it is true like like to make this conversation um productive like this is this is the idea of of where we're at you know and and the way that WF and who and IMF and all of these structures institutions now who are going to be governing the world you know globally while people are fighting about who's more right you know and which ethnic group has the time now to have the microphone huge shifts have happened on the planet you know um and I think even Vogue is irrelevant for that reason you know like we're talking about governments now like not even magazines not even newspapers like New York Times vote like who cares when you've got leaders of Nations that are willing to give up Nations and willing to give up countries to join this bigger idea of Oneness and togetherness you know and and they're selling you the brand togetherness yeah we're still fighting on the ground amongst each other about who gets the check and who gets the mic and who gets the Accolade and who gets the cover and who gets the you know perfume ad and it's like so far beyond that point you know and that is that is really whether you like Trump or not he also called stuff out you know and he was difficult to control and that's that's really what the problem was you know and now we have a new prime minister in England that just came in today or yesterday and um the concept of globalization and togetherness and we are one on the one hand is sold and then also if you believe in God you would also know that we are all one and together and if if you believe in God all of those people can see past prejudices you know and value the human being and value the connection to God whoever it is you know and also defend the innocent and so it's very confusing that these are running parallel I think there's a Awakening where people are becoming more spiritual but at the same time it this is adopted the same narrative one is the one is the idea and not the actuality that's being sold right yeah so World economic forum is pretending that yeah so we're all one one of the things one is oligarchy at the very top it's Masters and slaves exactly still within the monetary advisor getting down there and saying we're all one to the slaves right that's how I view the world economic Forum we're all one right and we're not all one obviously these are the people that are pushing forth the climate change narrative as just one but fly around private all day right we're all one means you're gonna be the slaves and we're going to tell you why you're going to be happy and have nothing and really at the top we're all one my opinion", "evFS5wfATxo": "and for today's episode i feel like it is high time that somebody says the quiet part out loud so today i'm going to do that ready the majority of americans cannot stand pride week pride month pride year whatever it is the month of june has been completely perverted and the majority of americans including my gay friends cannot stand this month so i'm going to give you five reasons why that's true you guys ready reason number one it's because pride month is emblematic of corporate cowardice everywhere you look all these corporations that don't even make sense are putting up rainbow flags right mcdonald's what was the issue with gay people at mcdonald's were gay people not being served at mcdonald's i walk into a furniture shop a couple of weekends ago and prominently displayed is this lgbtqia flag everybody's welcome to shop here at what point in american history were gay people not allowed to shop in furniture stores it's so emblematic of those stupid departments that are being built up diversity and inclusion departments somebody who is completely not qualified to even work at the corporations that they work at keeping a calendar of every ridiculous holiday that we continue to make up to make sure that corporations get on their knees about various social issues we have to we as a company are dedicating two hundred thousand dollars to lgbtq causes okay where is that money even going that's my question where is the money even going what is it that we are striving toward for gay people and lesbian people what don't they have in america that they need us to donate dollars corporate dollars to make sure that they secure in the future fear of out of control inflation is hammering the stock market the s p 500 is having its worst start to the year since world war ii that being said now might be a good time for you to diversify into gold the most stable asset in history and birch gold is the company that i trust to help you convert an ira or a 401k into an ira in gold and silver that's right not only will birch gold help you fortify your savings with precious metals they'll help you do it in a tax sheltered account text candace to 989898 to get started with your free no obligation info kit on gold from birch gold they are the precious metals professionals text candace to 989898 and secure your savings now number two is that actually it's insulting to black people i've been pretty outspoken i even think black history month needs to go away but let me tell you something if black people are getting one month for the stuff that we live through in america somebody's going to need to explain to me how it is that gay people and lesbian and trans people also got a month like what somebody gave me the history lesson right that qualifies an entire month in celebratory rainbows was there an island where there was gay people that were living happily and all of a sudden they got put onto boats and chains and brought over to america and forced to work i just i missed that history lesson that justifies them being able to throw their asses in my face for an entire month it's annoying and it's ridiculous thomas soul as you guys know is one of my favorite authors and he once wrote a quote and that quote is civil rights used to be about treating everyone the same but today some people are so used to special treatment that equal treatment is considered to be discrimination that is my opinion when it comes to the lgbtqirs agenda they think they're being discriminated against because they're not getting special privileges right which brings me to point number three the slippery slope of it all first it began as just a day a day of national pride and rainbows and sprinkles and skittles and they said oh actually we're going to need a whole week to demonstrate to you guys that we are proud to be gay and lesbian and queer then they weren't satisfied i said actually we're going to need an entire month to do this because uh we just need to be we need more time to express this to you and i'm never going to be satisfied right but person's like you love his love gay marriage it's just about gay marriage love is love and they got gay marriage and they said actually gonna tack on a t here uh we've got some transgendered issues and we need to be able to speak to your children about the fact that i'm a trans femme turtle and if you're not comfortable with that then it's because you're a bigot that's the figurative gun to everybody said right america's got a figurative gun to their head when these movements come around it's you either put up an lgbtqia flag or you hate homosexuals right you either put up a blm flag or you hate black people that's it it basically puts all of america in the closet because we have to pretend that we don't mind what's going on for an entire month and what's going on for an entire month oh that would be number four on my list it's perversity that is being dressed up as diversity we know this is stop pretending that this is about pride when you need to wear assless chaps and shake your butt in front of a child's face and then you say oh if you have any issues with this then it's because you're a bigot and you're raising your child to be a bigot your baby needs to be anti-racist like your baby needs to be anti and pro and supportive of all of these various causes they need to be pro-trans they need to be actively pro-trans agenda it's debauchery everywhere you look look at the pride parade why is it so okay to take your children to a thanksgiving day parade you have no fears but you know fully well that if you take your child to a pride parade your child is going to be exposed to a bunch of sexuality on display because that's just what they're allowed to do for an entire month they're allowed to be overtly sexual and pretend that they're a special snowflake and that if you don't like it it's because you're somehow a heterosexual freak who doesn't understand people need to express themselves let me be clear if a heterosexual couple acted in the same way as some of these couples act during a pride parade i would be disgusted because it's just gross it's just debauchery your sexuality doesn't mean anything to me i don't care what your sexuality is when you're being perverse you should be called out for it it's the same reason i called out cardi b for her performance on stage when i felt she was being disgusting at the grammys i don't care that cardi b is a heterosexual person i care that there are children in america who shouldn't be forced to watch this sort of stuff they shouldn't be forced to watch our cultural corrosion on screens that's how the majority of adults feel when pride month comes wrong but they're not allowed to say it or else they will be accused of being bad individuals who want homosexuals to be wiped off the face of the planet speaking of individuals who actually want homosexuals to be wiped off the face of the planet let's talk about number five it's also the cultural ignorance of it all right you get these people that come up to you and they're waving their flags they're the same people that are waving their pride flags in one hand and the ukraine flags are the other one right and then when you say hey wait uh gay marriage is not allowed in ukraine oh it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter there are actually places all across the world where homosexual people are oppressed and they never do anything for it that's not what they're raising money for they're raising money so they can indoctrinate our children with lgbtq agenda ideas right they don't care they'll tell you to donate tomorrow to saudi arabia if the right politician gets on stage and tells them to they're ignorant about their very existence and that drives me absolutely insane it also bothers me on a spiritual level that it is a corruption of what the rainbow signifies theologically remember this was god's promise that he would never again flood the earth and sometimes i asked a question when i look around and i see all this ridiculousness going on when i look at the perversion that our culture has become i look at everything that we're even talking about in this country you wonder if he should make good on that promise or not you wonder if we need a reset button of some sort on humanity all together so in closing it's a great irony that we spend this time calling it pride month when in reality it's anything but we should not be proud of this we should not be proud of the state of culture it's actually everything that americans should be ashamed of maybe we need a shame month

your questions so let's dive right into it question number one in a recent interview with savannah guthrie amber heard said quote even somebody who is sure i'm deserving of all this hate in vitriol even if you think that i'm lying you still couldn't tell me look me in the eye and tell me that you think on social media there's been a fair representation you cannot tell me that you think that this has been fair do you agree with her statements her statements are completely foolish so what social media is is that it's a reflection of how people are perceiving things it doesn't need to be a 50 50 split because we're not 50 50 on the issues so if i log on to social media and you're watching a debate that takes place between trump and biden and the majority of the social media believes that trump has won the debate you don't go well social media wasn't fair no it's telling you how you did it's a reflection of how you did you were scored according to how you did and it was very obvious from the beginning of a trial really from the moment that they played heard the nastiness of her words of saying oh no one's going to believe you johnny no one's going to what again you're going to cry you big baby that this was a woman that was lying that and that not only that but that she had completely played the masses what is particularly interesting about her take on herself is that she's forgetting the part of the years in which johnny was under the bus the entire media only took her side absent any evidence he was considered to be a horrible scumbag a wife abuser all the media headlines had her as this perfect amazing victim they showed that that footage of her with the bruise every event wanted to have her and she didn't mind that media representation which wasn't fair because as i said there was no other side being presented but her own and then finally and this is exactly why you know having a public trial works in many ways people got to hear both sides and when they heard both sides they assumed by on their own that amber heard and recognized on their own that amber heard was a liar so again social media isn't meant to be fair the court of public opinion isn't meant to be a fair square it's meant to actually allow us to hear both sides and determine um who we believe to be true and who we believe to be false and in this scenario amber heard you were false you were the liar and it took years for people to determine that good for johnny depp he deserved it i want to take a moment to talk to you about one of our sponsors birch gold fear of out of control inflation is hammering the markets the s p 500 is having its worst start of the year since world war ii so not only are your savings worth less you now have less of it now might be a good time for you to diversify into gold the most stable asset in the history of the world and birch gold is the company that i trust to help you convert an ira or a 401k into an ira in gold and silver that's right not only will birch gold help you fortify your savings with precious metals they'll help you do it in a tax sheltered account so text candace to 989898 to get started amazon stock was down 37 in

professionals text candace to 989898 and secure your savings now next question what do you think about the shortage of baby formula and tampons is this a new attack on women and children i believe it is incredibly suspicious um just the entire story of how they shut down the plant we covered this on a different show but they maybe thought and then ultimately determined that a couple of babies that had gotten sick i think there was approximately four babies that had gotten sick think about how many babies there are in america four babies get sick and they suddenly shut down the entire plan and i can't even fathom that they that they would ever do this for any other product because clearly they're not doing it for their own vaccines that they're pushing right so yeah could you imagine if they held the same standards for the copic vaccine how many people that we know that have gotten sick have developed autoimmune diseases people that died people that develop myocarditis and they won't pull it off the shelves they just say everybody keep rolling up your sleeves and now let's get it for children so it's remarkable that suddenly they are this cautious and they want to shut down the plan and to me it is just right in line with everything that we have been seeing this intentional push to depress the economy it seems to me that they want parents and they want families to be starving that they want parents to be economically depressed they want parents ultimately to be reliant on the government so in my feeling and again there i don't have any evidence of this i think there's something around the corner that's going to come that they want people to stop using that particular formula and there's going to be some government solution to feeding your baby that will come in the next couple of years maybe in the next year or so they always eventually show their hand but no this is not normal it's been such an extreme measure to just shut down the supply and to have so many people suffer but here's the thing it's also an opportunity you know i'm very into home gardening and doing things at home people have been sharing recipes of how to make your own baby formula because it used to be that you couldn't get it at cvs and you couldn't get it at your local drugstore and parents actually made it at home so i think it's time for mothers to learn that if you are unable to breastfeed then you should learn how to make your own home organic breast milk because that was what was done since the beginning of time until corporations stepped in next question if you're president right now who is your vp congressman thomas massey hands down i've had him on the show i followed him for a while i just do not have a disagreement with him in terms of how how he lives first and foremost he's somebody that truly lives off of his land and he backs up everything that he says i mean he even refused to get on a plane the entire time that they masked he drove something like 12 hours to d.c every time he had to make a vote because he refused to allow the government to arbitrarily mask him so if you don't know congressman thomas massey from kentucky i suggest you check him out but he would definitely be my vp we'll get back to these stories in just a second but first i want to talk to you about expressvpn it's super important to me that my personal data is protected at all times when using the internet every time you connect to an unencrypted network in cafes hotels airports etc your online data is not secured any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data but expressvpn creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so that they can't it would take a hacker with a supercomputer over a billion years to get past expressvpn's encryption expressvpn works on all your devices phone laptop tablet even on your smart tv and it's so easy to use just fire up the app and click one button to get protected i love it because i can rest assured that i'm never hacked or spied on by big tech get an extra three months of expressvpn free at expressvpn.com candice that's expressvpn.com candace expressvpn.com candace next question can you comment on paul pelosi's dui arrest yeah i certainly can um i will i would i will first offer comment on how unbelievably long it took for his mug shot to appear uh of how interesting it is that they won't show us the footage uh could you think that any other person would be granted this courtesy of not having the footage they're saying because you know for i forgot what reason they offered for why they can't give us the footage of him getting arrested when that obviously should be released do you guys remember when brad parscale of the trump campaign got arrested that footage was out within hours hours circulating all across the internet from getting arrested and yet in this case you have nancy pelosi who through marriage is related to gavin newsom you know they're doing everything they can to cover this completely um and they're pretending that somehow releasing the footage would compromise the trial that makes in give me an example of how that would compromise the trial or compromise anything at all he obviously probably acted like a complete fool probably said call nancy or i'll have you uh you know take in i'll have you fired if you take me and i'm sure he became suddenly nancy pelosi's husband in a you know in a real regard and you know this guy and nancy they're going to get away with the slap on the wrist because that's just what happens when you're a pelosi uh she's they're they're obviously very involved with the government they're implausibly corrupt but i do love the fact that we at the very least have his mug shot so there's that final question did you see christina aguilera's costume at la pride week where she was wearing a dildo i would love to hear your thoughts wow my thoughts on this um so first and foremost i was a huge christina aguilera fan growing up when i was a tween i guess you could say 11 12 years old she was the first album that i ever purchased with my own money and it's really interesting because a friend of mine had tweeted go back and listen to the music that you listened to when you were growing up and you'll start to realize that they were already planting seeds and sexualizing children and you'll be horrified and i thought about christian aguilera in this moment and i thought about her her big break which was a song called genie in a bottle and just going over the lyrics of that i'm a genie in a bottle baby gotta rub me the right way honey i think she was 17 years old when she put out this album it was her first album and that was her first big break this song talking about sex and somebody having to rub her the right way and obviously i didn't comprehend that when i was young i actually thought it was a song about genies but it's very obvious to me if you know anything about her story first and foremost christina aguilera did not grow up with the father in the home and this is a woman that had is tremendously talented has one of the most beautiful voices that i've ever heard but having a good voice wasn't enough she had to sell herself to a sex industry and she did it that's exactly what she did christina aguilera became a [\u00a0__\u00a0] to make money because being talented wasn't enough right so she started singing about men rubbing her then she started she came out with the dirty song and she's basically been half naked it's when i see something like this it makes me sad um that she thinks this is the only way that she can be supportive is to as a she must be in her near her 40s i think um as a an almost 40 year old woman perhaps even older than that she feels that this is the only way that she can be seen you your heart should break for christina aguilera my heart breaks for any woman in the world who thinks that she has to take her clothes off and strap on a dildo to be heard especially when that woman is wishing aguilera and her voice should have carried her all throughout her life it's not worth it to sell your soul to the devil for a little bit of fame and that's what you're seeing her do over and over again nothing has changed for christina there's been no development um and my child will never be allowed to listen to her music that's it all right you guys that's it for all the questions that we have as always i hope that we have given you something to think about thanks for joining me

transitioning back to become a British man London is 32 years old and he was embroiled in a controversy after he identified as trans-racial so that in my opinion if you can be transgender I don't see why you couldn't be transracial it makes perfect sense to me if we're pretending that there's no such thing as objective reality why can't Ali London who is a white male say actually I'm Korean that's what I feel like on the inside and nothing else matters he did this for about six months before he realized that this was a lie and this was wrong and here is him speaking to Tucker Carlson on Friday night take a listen provide as a Korean woman but six months later he's decided he's had enough now he's transitioning back to being a British man we thought we would ask him what that experience was like Ali London joins us tonight Island thanks so much for coming on um so why did you decide to become a Korean woman who told you that was possible so obviously I've had a difficult time with my gender identity struggles I was never unhappy with how I looked so I started changing I started dressing as a Korean woman and I realized that was a big mistake and I just want to be a boy but you know is there anyone that people like me and young people want to change their gender when we have the normalization of this in our schools in this country children are taught from a young age from the age of five in some cases that it's okay to change their gender it's okay to you know wear a skirt it's okay for a boy to use agenda neutral toilets when it puts girls at risk this is the new norm and schools are teaching about toxic masculinity they're eroding the alpha male the alpha straight male has been eroded you know Tucker what happened years ago when kids used to go to school they used to idolize Superman and astronauts now kids are being pushed this radical ideology they're taught to idolize weak men like Harry Styles weak politicians like Beto O'Rourke why is this happening you know and is it any Wonder people like me fall victim to this that I I had all this surgery I tried to change because you know I I kind of fell victim to this mentality I'm an adult but you know these kids can't make these decisions on their own they're being pushed this radical agenda and I'm grateful that I've come out the other side I'm grateful I found God but you know I want to speak up for these kids that are confused with their gender a lot of kids have gender dysphoria and you know that wasn't a thing 20 years ago Tucker this is what's being taught in the school system so here's the thing everything that Ali London is saying is correct it's music to my ears it's obviously a lot of the work that we do here at the daily wire and trying to expose this nefarious agenda on our children don't exactly if I'm being honest I don't exactly like Ali London's character Arc I don't like that it goes from somebody completely unknown just some British guy completely unknown then decides I'm going to be a Korean woman gets all this work done gets tons of attention and sponsorships and followers becomes an influencer and then six months later completely changes his mind and is now being on Tucker Carlson right he's now being featured on Tucker Carlson which is you know the biggest show in the United States my personal opinions is that what Ollie London is saying is true but also Ali London just wants attention that's my honest opinion I think that Ali London because he was unknown he fell victim to social media likes and clicks and saw that if you just pretended that you were gender dysphoric and pretended that you wanted to become a woman that you could get attention and he got that attention right he went through all these procedures people loved him he was an influencer being trans-racial got tons of headlines then all I wanted to realize you know what I'm doing this for attention I don't really want to be this how about I trans position and that will make another Splash into the conservative circles and that's exactly what he got attention and so this goes back to an earlier episode where we talked about your psychological immune system and how people are becoming more and more desperate online to get clicks and they're willing to do that if it means going under the knife they're also willing to do that if it means rejecting all the procedures that you got I do not think that Ali London is a stable individual that said I do think that having the discussion uh that discussion that he's having on Twitter Carlson will do more good than it does harm all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Ivanka Trump cropping out Kimberly Guilfoyle in a photo from Tiffany Trump's wedding so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description to subscribe right now [Music]", "dDx4cRHK5BU": "all right i want to jump right into uh this story it actually genuinely made me chuckle when i saw it because i just i find our intelligent agencies to be funny and it's not a good thing when you start like laughing and mocking your intelligence i just can't take them seriously anymore like i can't take them seriously after january 6 in the pipe bomb situation it's like you're done now for me right but apparently they have figured out on the opposite side of the globe that putin is going to stage a false flag attack on his own troops to set up a pretext to invade ukraine after talks between the u.s and russia collapsed and let's hear it from our pentagon here is live from a press conference without getting into too much detail we do have information that indicates that russia is already working actively to create a pretext for a for a potential invasion for you know a move on ukraine um in fact we have information that they've pre-positioned a group of operatives uh to conduct what we call a false flag operation um uh an operation uh designed to look like an attack on them or their peop or russian-speaking people uh in ukraine again as an excuse to to go in and we already have in addition uh indications that uh russian influence actors are already starting they're already starting to fabricate ukrainian provocations uh that in both state and social media to again try to justify uh in advance some sort of pretext for incursion i'm not at liberty to go into a whole lot more detail than that um but i i hope that by the fact that we can say this as confidently as we can you you can take away that uh that there's a fidelity here to the information that we have that that we believe is is very credible now i'm not a body language expert but michael give me your take on that when i look at the history of ukraine i notice it has not been an independent country for very long ukraine was ruled by austria-hungary ukraine was ruled by the ottoman empire ukraine was ruled by zorus russia it was ruled by the soviet union it was ruled by poland poland is one of the most conquered countries in the history of the world and poland managed to conquer ukraine so ukraine the word itself actually derives from the slavic word for borderland this is always going to be attention there are always going to be people fighting over ukraine as it is on its border does putin want to expand russian influence of course he does does nato want to expand its influence of course it does my broader question is this after we've heard for years and years of russian collusion and how work is when we look at the threat from china and we look at the threat from russia and we figure out which one of those threats is a greater threat to the united states have we not considered colluding with the russians because during the cold war during the cold war we warmed up our relationship with china to play off of the soviet union which was our greatest geopolitical threat if today we're looking around and saying china's much richer china's much stronger china owns our debt china owns a lot of resources in our country if we're trying to counter that threat from china would it not make sense to try to drive a wedge between china and russia and maybe warm up those relationships that would require too much maturity well here's the thing the problem is is that hunter biden is completely compromised he's done deals in ukraine and he he's in business relationships with china this is the thing we've said that the baida in china biden and china the their relationships need to be investigated people haven't when you deep dig when you dig deep you realize that they have relationships and this is the problem and this is the reason why there's so much meddling in ukraine like the biden administration is so compromised it's absolutely amazing to your to answer your question yes i i very much believe that the entire russia-russia-russia thing that we saw for two years was basically a plot from the democrats to guard against um president trump doing any deal with russia that would be common sense obviously russia is their next door neighbor china's next door neighbor they have nuclear arms to say hey let's do a deal you and i it would be a good guardian of china they did not want that to happen so by creating all this rhetoric it basically made it impossible for trump to go in and do any deal with putin without the press running and being like oh my gosh we told you he was a russian agent and they were successful it's a really interesting take i also think it's important to point out candace you say you no longer trust the intelligence agencies of our country after january the 6th i no longer trust the pentagon after what we saw happen in afghanistan when we were completely comfortable abandoning our own citizens in the hands of the taliban but it's interesting to point out that the enemy of your enemy is not always your friend and that could be true for nato but could also be true for political leaders here in the united states and those leading our military to take action against this so-called investigation that we're leading here on russia and what could potentially happen let alone what's actually happening in the world particularly with china and this healthy skepticism of those who are in charge of our military be it officials at the pentagon or our commander-in-chief who can't even remember what state he's in let alone who we should be fighting or having positive relationships with that is what a free country is built on and you mentioned maybe we no longer live in a free country we're forcibly vaccinating our own citizens we're shutting down freedom of speech we're no longer criticizing our own government that should be the main story when it comes to russia russia russia not this external empty shell they're trying to tell you like red lines are cool the pressure's like oh it's actually cool to starve it's so forward like bizarre times here in america we really are and she makes a brilliant point of what happened in afghanistan are we now going to see something similar happen and try to engage americans in this conflict and trump had was on the right track talking about nato and should we really be involved with this and it's expanding and expanding i believe nato now has what 28 countries involved in this organization they've been trying to get ukraine for a long time and putin has said this is my red line you are not coming to my borders with the military alliance and they keep pretending that it's wild i mean imagine if we like if putin tried to put weapons in mexico and canada that's what nato is trying to do right now right this is such a good discussion and we will get right back into it after this quick message i have said this before but my favorite part of each day is sitting around the dinner table with my family we make it a priority to put our phones away and have meaningful conversations and a quality meal but if you're like me life is busy and convenience is key that's where good ranchers comes in good ranchers sends 100 american meat from local farms straight to your door it's all individually wrapped and vacuum sealed which makes it so quick and easy to cook their meat is high quality ethically raised and sustainably sourced and the chicken they source have never been shot up with hormones or antibiotics which is something that i think is super important plus they have tons of variety you can get filets pre-seasoned chicken breast rib eyes shrimp and more right now they

checkout that's goodranchers.com candice or use my code candace at checkout this also raises a deeper question of what it means to expand american or western influence because i looked at a video it came out some months ago of a military cathedral that they built in russia putin funded it this beautiful beautiful cathedral some older elements some modern elements my goodness i thought when could we build a building like that here in america what are we building in america we're building libraries to host drag queen story hours we're building hideous sorts of secular art and architecture and i i just think if we want to defend american interests as of course all americans do we need to define what those interests are and i think if we were defending truth justice in the american way the good the true and the beautiful and freedom and all that great stuff then i think a lot of people would be much more eager to project american influence abroad if what we're really fighting for is to fly pride flags in kandahar then i don't think we necessarily have a lot of people who want to spread that influence but that's the thing you're assuming that all americans want to defend american interests i would disagree with you there michael in fact i think many people especially those leading our country right now are interested in destroying american interests to make way for authoritarian authoritarian policies and big government exactly pointing the finger at putin and exactly it's exactly what's going on in our in our country and they always have this excuse we're trying to spread freedom we don't have freedom right now right we don't have freedom so how are you spreading what we don't have right you must have gotten the vaccine you can still catch and spread it i don't know it's like i don't understand what you're talking about here we are not spreading freedom anywhere we're actually in the last two years it's scary i don't we don't recognize this country and it will be at our expense because we're one of the largest funders of nato so we're going to take the biggest risk and incur the most debt in doing this right right it's so it's just to me it's something that people need to watch there's a lot happening in the eastern corridor um next week we're actually going to be launching a foreign policy segment me and jack pasobic and we're going to talk about these issues so people really understand even the mentality of people in the east is not understood so the american government can freely lie and to keep telling you oh look at this protest they want us to come in they want our military to expand they love western principles they really don't in the eastern corridor they're so much more conservative i mean the most conservative people in america are not as conservative as people are in the east i've been there you speak to the people they don't have this fear of russia and the way that they present it in america because they know that in many ways people are still living in the cold war in their head and it's just not it's not practical over there thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video

of my first play date in life and yes I'm being serious because it's important and it always stuck with me I was in kindergarten when I first went on a play date with someone other than a member of my family and it was with a girl she had blonde hair and blue eyes and we became Fast Friends I'll never forget the car Journey up to her house I was so shocked to see so many trees and the houses were getting bigger and bigger and bigger now the majority of you guys that are watching this you already know my story you know that my family came from nothing in fact at this time in my life we were living in a very small apartment and me and my two sisters were sharing a very tiny bedroom it was a roach infested apartment I was used to the Exterminator coming into that apartment and so I was shocked when I got to this young girl's house and I found something so different she effectively lived in a mini Mansion I had never seen anything like it she had her own playroom she had her own bedroom everything was so immaculate she had glass dolls lined up she had a housekeeper I remember just being shocked because what I learned at her house was that there were people that didn't live like me I thought everybody had to share a room with their siblings I didn't know that another option existed I didn't know that there was something else in fact seeing that something else probably very early on made me think I want that I want that option fast forward 13 years and I was 18 years old and I went on a trip to China 10 days in China to this day it Remains the worst trip that I have ever been on because I was traumatized I remember calling my then boyfriend from the hotel rooms and I was crying I was crying because I just wasn't expecting to see what I saw I thought this was going to be a glamorous trip far from glamorous it was the exact opposite it was just sheer poverty there are people actually showering in the streets at a horrible stench worse than that as children the children that were masked I thought to myself what is this the oppression and the filth of China actually shocked me I was recently discussing that trip with my husband and I said to him why do the people put up with that why are the people in China put up with living in those circumstances really think about this for a second they are a nation of about 1.5 billion people and every element of their lives is being controlled by a small totalitarian government why don't the people rise up against the government why don't they demand better conditions for their children for themselves a government which a very short time ago told them how many children they were even allowed to have via a one-child policy that's absurd where are the uprisings we never hear about them and do I know what my husband said to me he said the people that live in China have never known anything else generations and generations spanning over a millennia of Oppression that is what the state has been in China forever they don't know that freedom is an option they don't know like me as a small child that there's something else which really makes me think about where we are today right now in this Society think about what's happening all across our country all across the West really think about it right now there is a generation of children and if we don't do something right they're not going to remember what the world was like before Mass censorship they're not going to know what it was like to be able to say something in America and to not be fact checked censored to have your accounts deleted they may not even know what it was like when they didn't have to walk around with masks on their face when they were allowed to go to school with masks not on their face they will have no remedy they'll just think this is normal I'm always supposed to have a mask on my face they may not know what it was like to walk into a restaurant without being asked to show their papers are you vaccinated let me see your cards let me see if you received the vaccine otherwise you can't eat in here we're going to have an entire generation of people who think that it's normal to have to submit to random testing to travel those people won't know that there's another option they won't know that there's the option of freedom they won't know that it ever even existed We Are The Last Stand For That generation otherwise they don't they're never going to desire what they didn't know exist just like China those children will never desire it because they will have never known that it existed think about how scary that is I want you to consider my words today very carefully because they are a direct call to action thanks for joining me on this episode of Candace if you wish you could come

organizations uh what's behind that is there someone in your family who served or is it just my granddaddy was in the Army but you know a long long time ago and I never knew him but um I started doing Uso stuff when I first you know uh got a record deal I started doing Uso stuff and that's that just you know organically went to Veterans organizations and it's been really the most rewarding thing that I've done in my career working with Wounded Warrior Project and and other veterans organizations I mean those people are just uh they're so awe-inspiring and and um I people ask me why I do so much stuff with veterans organizations and I think it's it's almost a selfish Endeavor don't pat me on the back too hard because if you have a chance to hang around with Heroes that's very cool and you should do it every chance you get maybe some of it to rub off on you [Applause] [Music] hang on right now it was actually inspired I was speaking with a songwriter now she might know him Jeffrey Steele I do know Jeffrey Jeffrey I'm I'm hanging out with him every night a lot of my hits uh Jeffrey wrote A lot of my head really yeah yeah I love Jeffrey he's amazing he's an amazing amazing guy and we were kind of having this conversation about how he was telling me that he has written now a lot of songs that are patriotic and sometimes he'll get these big country singers who will turn them down by saying like you know kind of like not now because there's just I guess now in society you go back a couple of decades and it was like yeah USA love America this is great and now it's suddenly like controversial to be outwardly I support the troops I support you know the veterans have you noticed that change because you've been around for so long is there a different is there some I guess fear would be my question there's a little bit of fear of like I can't be like too overtly for me not for you but are you seeing it in the climate of music and the way that Jeff is kind of telling me yeah you don't subscribe to it no yeah exactly yeah I said yeah it's interesting to see that and I think I don't have much I don't have much to talk to those people about so yeah it's weird I don't associate with them yeah well you know I'll say one thing it's it's not true Cowboy to get in line you know what I mean you gotta be a little wild I think that that's one thing that people turn to country music and I said to Jeff I said imagine calling yourself a country music singer and you have any fear about loving your country that seems a little backwards to me right yeah no I am I I've put a song that pays tribute to the men and women that serve on I think almost every album that I've done and I've been very reluctant to make them singles you know try to get them pushed and get played on the radio because it seems self-serving you know I don't know I think we need more of it we need this generate we need like the Lee Greenwood God bless USA type stuff you know it's that it's it's important because you know aside from the fact that they're Heroes which is obviously it's just so apparent that they're Heroes but they are also representing the one thing that really keeps the glue like it's the one thing we all have in common right like this this country this flag um it's a uniting it's it's a uniting message so I wish there was more of it as you know my pillow is

all the music that you have recorded what is your favorite song that's a big question if you've done a lot of songs what's the one that you're like fair question it's a very fair question no it's not yeah because you're in the studio and you I mean you really you you put your heart and soul into all these songs and and they're almost like children you know and so you don't want to pick I have a favorite child but I'm not going to tell anybody that's exactly why I should be able to pick it everybody has a favorite child but you shouldn't tell anybody yeah right that's right that is so true to tell anybody yeah that's not right but I mean whichever song that elicits the the best response from the audience On Any Given night that's my favorite song because my job is to get that response from an audience and whichever song does it that's my favorite song you know so well you know did have a song that I think is the most inspirational song that you've ever done um 100 percent and I think we gotta Play a clip of it [Music] ches can we just actually give it up it is not easy to come up with a word that actually ends up being in the dictionary like you know if you've actually created a word it became a culturally iconic word I mean can we just tell me the story of this where you're just in the studio and we're like well like what rhymes with Honky Tonk Badonkadonk no no actually I think Missy Elliott came up with it she said Badonkadonk I think she started that keep my eyes did she did she did so we shamelessly stole it but you know and then you got all the credit yeah it's great because it rhymed with Honky Tonk you know is that one of the ones that was a tough day at the office by the way [Laughter] sure you looked like you were struggling it well it was it was a very hard day at the office I sacrifice if you like this video subscribe to this YouTube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new videos", "p2dVMzG2mhM": "i'm gonna start um because i'm really fired up about basically everything that's going on with the children in the classrooms and i feel like especially me and you brandon have been talking about how progressivism is just regressivism it's just like they're so forward they're backwards and um a black mother in atlanta stood up to the principal after realizing that her daughter was actually being segregated into all black classrooms which is incredible let's just watch the clip of her talking about this battle that she's going through in atlanta we've lost sleep trying to figure out like why would a person do this kyla posey says she was stunned when she learned about classes segregated by race at maryland elementary last year a practice she says was put in place and condoned by principal sharon briscoe first it was just disbelief that i was having this conversation in 2020 with a person that looks just like me a black woman it's segregating classrooms you cannot segregate classrooms it's you can't do it is this it is like it's like disbelief that you have these conversations and it's how i feel and i really empathize with her especially as a black person when you're talking to a black progressive and they just don't see it like they're just like what do you mean like this is a safe space for black people and this is just i mean this is really the tip of the iceberg we also know that in college campuses they're talking about all black dorms because black people need to be kept safe from white people and i'm sitting here thinking like oh well you know jim crow laws why didn't the democrats back then just say actually we just want to keep you safe it's a safe space or this is going to be the safe water fountain for black people this is going to be the safe school for black people the safe neighborhood like we have become so stupid that you could actually just package it as safety and you would see people would just fall in line and clearly this principle is black that's kind of the most incredible part of the story is that she's sitting down with another black woman having this discussion yeah i mean it speaks to the brainwashing that's going on you know back in the day you had jim crow back in the day you had the kkk and now some members of the black community are implementing those very things without any influence they are doing it to themselves it is incredibly crazy that a black woman with all that has gone on she's probably woken and woke crying about white supremacy every day but yet she's segregating these classes putting children at a disadvantage but i'm i'm fortunate and he's fortunate and i'm glad that the black mom stood up and said you know i'm not i'm not okay with this we're not going back down this path i believe in having you know uh equal education for my child and we're not gonna you know go back past uh martin luther king's you know speech that you know we should be judging on the content of character not the colored skin the cost of

oppress themselves right so they never really changed anything they were doing they just said how can we convince people that doing this to themselves is a type of virtue right so if you're black now the education system is teaching that like to be the ultimate best kind of black person you oppress yourself right you you basically say i'm going to be away from women because i'm so alert and educated about how bad white people are that i'm actually going to remove myself from the scenario which is just teaching people to self-segregate what the left does better than anybody else that they teach people to oppress themselves and they don't even know that they're doing they don't know they're doing it they're they're fighting to oppress themselves which is incredible to me like it's just it's like nothing i've ever seen and that's a sad truth and they don't realize that you've been taught to believe that that's a virtue to abort your children is a virtue you know it's crazy what we've done and nobody's you know the the popular narrative is not to come out and address these things that address the real problems it's not white supremacy what's the other thing about those we fund the police teaching people to oppress themselves to fund the policemen people on the streets demanding that the streets be that the police be defunded that's another way of oppressing yourself and who does that hurt what communities does that hurt the most you can speak to that better than anyone as a former police officer defunding the police hurts the inner city neighborhoods they're the ones they're the ones that use us right i mean you know nobody's driving police are not in martha's vineyard you know but they're not just over yeah yeah sophisticated bunch yes yeah we're definitely just in a really really bad place in this country right now but i do think that in a way it's good that parents are starting to see that yes you're just manifesting the exact same policies of the past that you swore you were getting away from because progressivism is regressivism and aaron yeah i'm sorry i think the moms and the dads in this country who are just average moms and dads didn't ever want to be political they're going to save this country yeah they are going to save i know a lot of moms we are the ones yeah that are doing the hard work uh there's a group from my former town of philadelphia called the conservative women of the main line these women had no political aspirations they were playing tennis and living their best lives and then they saw their kids learning critical race theory they saw their kids being stuck in masks all day they saw their kids not going to school for 18 months and now they're a group of moms a group of dads that have come together and said enough we are running for school board we are changing our schools we can't live like this anymore it's those moms and dads i believe i believe that they're gonna change nothing like the power of mothers especially when they get together like mom like we can instantly turn into like the cia and the fbi if we want to call it once there's something about women like when we are passionate about something it's like that's it i will find out i will find the data i will be i will be in the trenches i will do whatever i need to do we have a very special skill set that's all i'll say if you like

story I'm pretty sure she used to be on the left and yesterday she sent out some Tweets in support of Alex Jones so let me give you the background before we actually get to her tweets so Alex Jones you'll remember he has been facing a couple of defamation lawsuits because he spread theories about the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary that essentially said that none of the 20 children and the six adults that were killed had actually died and that their relatives were crisis actors well now he has been ordered to pay 965 million dollars okay so almost a billion dollars to the families of those that were killed the verdict which was returned on Wednesday by a jury in Connecticut in the defamation trial joins the 49 million dollars that was already awarded by a Texas jury earlier in the year to another Sandy Hook family who had brought a separate case against Jones and there's also a third case that is tentatively set for later this year now let me just say this um in no way do I condone the conspiracy theories that were surrounded around Sandy Hook I do know that as a Connecticut resident I I was a Connecticut resident at that time I remember that a lot of the families had a lot of questions that were not being answered regarding the Sandy Hook shooting I think Alex Jones voiced some of those questions and then went a little far obviously and said that nobody died in everything uh was potentially just crisis actors and that is what landed him in these suits the verdict what do you think about that um well you might think well how of course the family is upset they lied people started believing in these conspiracy theories and they were harassed because the fam that because people believed that they were all crisis actors and that's a horrible thing to go through imagine losing your child and then having to suffer a bunch of people that believe that your child isn't even dead of course you can understand that but what's interesting here is when we decide that conspiracy theories in the media are harmful and when we decide that they are not and that is what rapper M.I.A is giving a voice to she tweeted Alex Jones lying and Pfizer lying both trending one with penalty of or without if you have no critical thinking faculty this is about as crazy as we should get before a nuclear war Wipeout wipes out she meant to say the human race she then tweeted if Alex Jones pays for lying shouldn't every celebrity pushing vaccines pay too oh wow yeah that is a lot of critical thinking and it's definitely going to land her into some trouble but she makes a point we have become increasingly hypocritical I mean if Alex Jones pushed a harmful conspiracy theory I it was harmful because it led to the harassment of others what about the entire covet conspiracy theory the idea that masks worked which has now been debunked oh it's just okay you have to wear masks the idea which we showed yesterday that taking the vaccine was going to make you immune to covid are we forgetting that every news anchor they were running the death ticker making everybody fearful telling you that if you could kill the people that you love unless unless you get this vaccine and then of course they turn to Hollywood and they tried to make it cool to get this vaccine yeah well some senior executive advisor testified no we actually when we rolled out that back we had no idea whether or not it was going to work that was essentially which testified we had no idea whether or not it was going to make you immune to covid but we rolled them out anyways absent the tests that should have been required before the media was allowed to spread that conspiracy theory the conspiracy with the being that if you received this vaccine you were going to be better protected against covid-19 and the people that were not that was a lie that was a conspiracy theory and it led to a lot of harm in fact it led to people that lost their jobs people that were more completely mocked online me being one of them how stupid could you be to not get this vaccine I'm paraphrasing here but that came down from Megan McCain remember that whole debacle how dare you're just stupid and foolish at this point if you didn't get the vaccine right it was mockery it was peer pressure celebrity peer pressure for everyone to roll up their sleeves and to Simply inject something into their body something that we now know caused a lot of issues for women and their menstruation should those women who had those issues with their menstruation be able to sue the celebrities to be able to sue CNN to be able to sue Rachel Maddow to be able to sue Pfizer for lying safe and effective they said define safe and effective clearly it's not effective unless we have some new definition of what effective means an effective vaccine would render you immune to the disease that is purported to protect you from so why is Alex Jones being forced to pay a billion dollars okay essentially a billion dollars when you add up so far and yet all of these celebrities and the entire mainstream media that forced you to do something against your will through a concerted fear campaign in a peer pressure campaign not being sued at all not even being mocked not even being called out they're just moving on nobody cares right it's not the only circumstance which has happened in which we keep seeing this astounding hypocrisy in our society right another story in case you're not paying attention to it is that Saudi Arabia has come out and flatly and plainly accused the Biden Administration accused Joe Biden himself of essentially asking for a quid pro quo essentially trying to interfere with the midterm elections by saying we just need you to peop to take pumping oil please OPEC just keep pumping oil right until the midterms because we don't want the gas prices to Skyrocket and people to maybe vote and think actually this Administration is causing me harming my own household so yes households pardon so yes the Daily Mail mail ran a headline that the Saudi Arabian government gave a bombshell statement stating that the Biden Administration reached out and pleaded with them to delay the OPEC deal to cut oil production until after the midterms now why is this accusation problematic why is it hypocritical oh wait I know ask me uh wasn't it just a short while ago when then president Donald Trump was in office that the Democrats sought and successfully impeached him for this very same accusation and theirs was completely unfounded everybody remembers the perfect phone call it was a perfect phone call Trump says a perfect phone call I spoke to president zielinski in Ukraine and yet the Democrats came out and they accused him of asking for a quid pro quo the quid pro quo quo at that time that they accused of of executing was saying to Ukraine we're going to withhold military funding unless you do my dirty work the Dirty Work that they say he asked for was for them to look into and to investigate Hunter Biden and that he was not going to okay Ukraine getting military aid unless this investigation was done the only problem with this claim against Trump is that when you read the transcript which of course they released later there is no such thing happened he never once said I'm going to withhold military aid to Ukraine that is what that is at the Crux of this debate right he had to have actually said you can only get this Aid if you do this here's what president Trump said directly from the transcript he said I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it now quick pause to give you to to bring you back to the memory of what we're talking about at this time Trump had just survived the never-ending Robert Mueller investigation the claims were that he was colluding with Russia it was in fact a cloud over this country people demanding that he did collude because oh I know the conspiracy theorists over at MSNBC Rachel Maddow the conspiracy theorist over at CNN Jake Tapper and Don Lemon kept pounding this narrative for years forcing the American people apart people that were firmly in the camp of yes they did collude with Russia that's how Trump run they needed that to be true because they couldn't believe that the American people just elected him fair and square they needed to believe that Russia had somehow gotten involved in our elections and made this happen and so they let this Cloud for two years ignore the American people they had people arguing with their family members over this you're either team Trump and believe this or you understand that Russian collusion is real and then one day Robert Mueller said actually no uh he didn't include with Russia it's cool it's he didn't do that so Trump is speaking after his name has been cleared right and people are starting to realize that this entire narrative entire narrative that he colluded with Russia actually came out of Hillary Clinton's Camp right they planted these lies and they allowed this Cloud to exist as a part of a political strategy so he's talking to president zelinsky and I'll continue so he says I would like you to do a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine they say crowdstrike I guess you have one of your wealthy people the server they say Ukraine has it there are a lot of things that went on the whole situation I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it as you saw yesterday that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller an incompetent performance but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine whatever you can do it's very important that you do it if that's possible Trump then went on to ask the other thing there's a lot of talk about Biden's son that Biden stops the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it it sounds horrible to me this is true obviously because biom notoriously said on stage that while he was the vice president he went into Ukraine and he stopped the prosecution of somebody because he was upset with the personal treatment of his son so yes Trump did ask them to look into the servers that were behind all of these lies that he included with Russia he asked them to explore what exactly is going on with President well he wasn't the president then but then uh Vice President Joe Biden who is saying that he had some influence in the region these are all valid questions and concerns if you're sitting president United States you would want to get to the bottom of these concerns that we're seeing in the media you're having a conversation with the person that can get to the bottom of these concerns that being president zelenski never once in this entire phone call did he say and if you don't and if you don't we're not going to provide you any more military aid that was a lie that was made up it was so made up it was reinforced by the conspiracy theorists that demanded that just as we had gotten over the faux Russian investigation that we now needed Trump to be impeached for what he says amounted to a perfect phone call what the transcript shows is not a problematic phone call whatsoever and so when we see these things taking place and we see that Alex Jones is being asked to pay a billion dollars for spending a conspiracy theory the question we should ask ourselves is why not whether or not you agree with what Alex Jones said right what not whether or not you agree with the conspiracy theory right the question is why is only he being made to pay for it the answer is because we know that right now what we were existing under is something like a regime it is not a stress to say this is the Biden regime they are using the full power of the Department of Justice to go after their foes their foes of course are President Trump their foes are all of his supporters right the January 6th protesters those people need to be locked up but BLM can burn the place down how hypocritical is that we need to start funds to get people that are looting and rioting in the name of black lives matter out of prison but we need to make sure that we show people that the people that trespassed into the capital uh no those people are the true domestic terrorists it is ongoing hypocrisy that is continuing to happen in this country and in my opinion it is reaching a fever pitch people are are becoming more audacious and speaking out M.I.A has audaciously spoken out and said this is not right either Rachel Maddow should be forced to play a billion dollars Don Lemon the entire gang at CNN and MSNBC or nobody should be forced to pay a billion dollars for defamation ladies gentlemen if you have not yet seen the documentary I hope you are realizing now that you need to exclusively on daily wire plus and so is the next portion of the show I'll be talking about the new video that just surfaced of Nancy Pelosi from January 6 on the day of January 6th so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "U3Irfyzv5kg": "hello and welcome and we can just get right into this because you know what we we are going to cover today we obviously have to cover the george floyd trial conclusion which is that derek chovan is guilty on all counts and i have to appreciate people that were trying to create a pressure campaign for me on twitter saying i wonder what candice is going to say even republicans agreed that this was the right call i don't care who agrees that this was the right i don't care if it's a republican i don't care if it's a democrat i don't care if it's a white person i don't care if it's a black person i am not so much of an intellectual coward that because the mob decides something because the lie about george floyd and the way that he lived his life has become so big that we just have to now accept it as the truth and believe me this is a lie nancy pelosi yesterday said quote thank you george floyd for sacrificing your life for justice she also said quote that his name will always be synonymous with justice george floyd's name will always be synonymous with justice you have got to be kidding me don't tell me doesn't matter it does matter this is the most important part that he is now becoming synonymous with justice let me remind you guys i've done it before right when the media was spinning all the lives and the media first came out and they said oh george floyd was just getting his life together he moved to minnesota he got released from prison in 2014. he was just getting his life together you remember that do you guys remember that media depiction of saint george who was just doing things for kids and just loved the kids and really was trying to set a good example and was just getting his life together until i reminded people of what his actual record was because it became apparent to me that there was a reason that they were not producing the police footage because they wanted to make sure that the lie was perpetuated around the world and repeated over and over again before the truth could get up from bed and put its shoes on and here is the truth here is the person whose life and whose name is now synonymous with justice nancy pelosi george floyd has a rap sheet and i'm going to remind you guys of it again today he was arrested for delivery of a controlled substance he was arrested and put into jail he was arrested for theft he was arrested for theft again he spent 10 months and 10 days in jail he was arrested for failure to identify he spent 15 days in jail he was again arrested for possession of a controlled substance less than one gram of cocaine he was then arrested for trespassing no forcible entry he was arrested for delivery of a controlled substance he was arrested for possession with intent to manufacture or distribute another 30 months in jail total he was arrested for aggravate aggravated robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon and that has really got to be the most significant arrest for me because of how sick what he did was ready here's a statement at this time a black ford explorer pulled up in front of the complainant's residence the complaint that we're talking about the woman had somebody knock on her door and say that they were from the water department and then that person forced their way into her home and then a foreign explorer pulled up and there were five other black males that exited this vehicle and proceeded to the front door the largest of these suspects forced his way into the residence this is george floyd forced his way into the residence placed a pistol against the complainant's abdomen and forced her into the living room area of the residence the large suspect then proceeded to search the residence while another armed suspect guarded the complainant who was struck in the head and side areas by the second armed suspect with his pistol after she screamed for help i should also mention that there was a toddler in the residence at the time that this happened a toddler that was traumatized by what george floyd did a woman who was traumatized by what george floyd did various people who were traumatized throughout the life of george floyd he left a wake of victims that is what happened he had so many victims throughout his life but right now the world has decided that he is just a wonderful human being you're not allowed to talk about his record not a lot talk about anything there are children that are running around with george floyd church there are murals that have been constructed dedicated to george floyd because his name has now become synonymous with justice i guess my question is justice for who how do i do that how do i live a life so that people say candace owens's name is synonymous for justice it's not telling the truth people hate that people say you're not allowed to say it you're not allowed to talk about who this person actually was because the media has agreed on a narrative before the truth has gotten out about who this man was getting his life together is anybody still buying that anymore oh no never mind it actually turns out that at the time of his arrest he had fentanyl in his system he also had methamphetamine in his system we also learned that the week prior he had had an overdose but none of that matters because now we live under mob rule mob rule just says that if a black man dies and a white person is around while that black person dies it is a racially motivated crime they've never proved that nothing about this was about race at all but it doesn't matter because now george floyd has been propped up and this is what we have to agree on nobody's allowed to tell the truth why aren't they doing this why can't we honestly have an assessment and come to an agreement by the way i would have been perfectly comfortable people said derek chovin was guilty of manslaughter i'm comfortable with that charge i'm not comfortable with the lies that have been told repeatedly about who this man was if you care about black lives if you're watching a sneaking candice i just care about black lives then why can't we discuss black criminality at the same time because usually on the other end of black criminality is a black victim that was the case with jacob blake that was the case over and over again with george floyd that's also the case with and let's talk about the person that was trending all last night and all this morning mikaya bryant is that her name the woman the the young woman that they're now saying is 16 year old girl in columbus ohio who was shot on tuesday by police did you guys see the clip of her mother she was shot and killed by police because she was attempting to stab another girl it's on camera she was a knife wielding maniac but those details don't matter don't forget because her mother came out and said that makaya had a motherly nature about her she promoted peace kya bryant's mother wants you to know that the knife-wielding maniac that you saw is not who she really was maybe in that moment she was trying to kill somebody but the point that we should be focused on is that micaiah bryant like to promote peace in her spare time right i mean this is like i feel like we have now tapped in to fiction like now we have to just accept fiction it doesn't matter because makaya bryant was black and she died at the hands of police officer and that's all that matters now people want to come out and they want to support micaiah bryan maybe she too like george floyd will be buried into a gold casket maybe eventually one day nancy pelosi will say that micaiah bryant's name will be synonymous synonymous with justice let me tell you what is actually happening in america at this time if you're a black american you better pay attention right now in america the goal is to make sure that black people love and support criminality that is the goal the express goal now is to make black people believe that we should be in the streets rioting and looting and demanding justice for criminals right because that is what these people are they're criminals george floyd was in the process of committing a crime i'm not saying he deserved to die i don't think anybody deserved to die i think he deserved to be arrested they attempted to arrest him did you forget that part have you seen the full video of his arrest the media refuses to show the full video that shows the police tried to put him into the vehicle multiple times and he resisted arrest by saying i'm claustrophobic i'm claustrophobic because he had just ingested fentanyl fentanyl that thing that's a hundred times more potent than morphine he had just ingested it because he didn't want to again get caught with a controlled substance as he had done repeatedly throughout his life let's ignore the testimony from his girlfriend who said that they were both addicted which by the way that is sad drug addiction is sad we can be talking about drug addiction we should be talking about drug addiction that would be a meaningful discussion but instead let's ignore all of these things that would help us fix black america let's let's not talk about drug abuse let's not talk about drug dealers let's not talk about criminality let's not talk about why micaiah bryant had a knife and was trying to stab a woman to death let's just talk about black victimhood because the discussion about black victimhood almost guarantees us that in the future black neighborhoods are only going to get worse when you start celebrating criminals that is of course what is going to be the end result we're going to have more black death we're going to produce more black failures because we're not allowed to talk about the truth anymore and republican democrats are even saying that this is good right so let's not talk about it it's just been agreed the lie has been agreed upon don't say anything if you tell the truth candace you're a bad person i don't care what i am called just because right now in this country we are facing a pandemic of cowardice because people are too scared once the mob says that this is what must be said and these are the only things that can be said because the media has now created a system a successful system of propaganda where people don't even know what the truth is because the lie has been said over and over and over again that does not mean that i'm going to back down to the truth in fact i think more than ever now we need to have people that are willing to stand up and to say that what is happening in this country is wrong what is happening in this country is backwards none of these people that i mentioned are heroes welcome to candace all right it's been a crazy week it feels like every week is crazy in america and there's so much that we have to get to here to help me break down the top stories as hosts of the andrew clavin show the daily wires very own andrew clavin plus turning point usa spokesperson isabelle brown and former police officer and ceo of the officer tatum welcome back brandon tatum all right guys give me your first thoughts derek chauvin trial verdict is in he is guilty on all charges uh that you can't really say if you weren't sitting in the jury i'm not going to say they got it wrong but i will say that derek shoven did not get a fair trial it's not a fair trial when a congresswoman a sitting congresswoman is out in the streets telling people to riot if they don't get the verdict they want it's not a fair trial the president of the united states is praying for the right verdict because he says the evidence is overwhelming it feels like a jury that was under duress just a little just a little bit yeah well i hate to agree with aoc on much or anything at all to be honest but she did come out on social media yesterday and said this is proof of the system not working of course she meant that to be she wanted more accountability for police officers defund the police let's overthrow the system entirely but she's right in the fact that this is the system not working when you have jurors and judges and anyone associated with a trial fearing for their lives for their family's safety for their job for their home or business to be burned down because they happen to be selected to choose the fate of this particular police officer that's a problem that's not due process in action and it's not the free country we live in it's mob justice in my opinion yeah the left is complete hypocrites you know when you think about it and you look at the justice system you say well after the crime was committed the next day after the video came out he was he was fired and shortly after he was indicted then ten hours of deliberation he was convicted um i don't understand what justice they're looking for you know what they really want is they want to continue to push a narrative for people to hate the police and in this mob rule meaning that if we you know get out here and burn enough stuff you're going to have the the verdict that we want this is crazy that we live in a country like this and i'll say this about chauvin's case and i think his defense made a huge mistake by not having him testify they needed to have him be humanized because he's just looking dumb sitting there and the only video they see of him was with his knee i think he was damned if he did damned if he didn't i think it was decided on before he even stepped foot the media had decided that the verdict was guilty and this was really to me an extraordinary test of how powerful the media is people still do not know what happened on the day that george floyd died they've never even seen any video outside of the nine minute video that was played over and over and over again on loop and they purposefully held back giving just releasing the police cam which would have cleared up so many of the lies and it's amazing the emotional power of the narrative as opposed to the truth the story they tell joe biden a man who's been in government since the 1970s got on television and said we are an inherently racist society inherently racist government he said he basically talked about this trial as if it were difficult to get a conviction of a police officer who has killed a person which just isn't true it just isn't true if you have the testimony if you have the evidence you can convict a police officer in this country he was talking as if it were 40 years ago people were weeping in the streets when this verdict came in as if it were not a done deal as if they were it wasn't the derrick chopin who was the guy under the under pressure it's amazing how completely how completely the press working together with the left has sold this narrative that this is a racist country i lived out of this country for most of the 90s this is the least racist country on the face of the world you would think that former vice president joe biden would acknowledge the fact that america is not a backwards racist country as he stood next to the first black man to be elected as president united states two times right this is a majority white country 60 white country it would not have happened barack obama would have never been president had it not been for the fact that america has moved on from race but they don't want us to move on from race anymore and that's exactly what we're getting at that's all they've got and i want to get to this tweet because i was so physically nauseated by it it was from the mayor of minnesota he says ready george floyd came to minneapolis to better his life but ultimately his life will have bettered our city the jury joined in a shared conviction that has animated minneapolis for the last 11 months they refused to look away and affirmed he should still be here today brandon minneapolis to better his life when you want to better your life how much fentanyl do you take simon says i mean i don't know what how much fentanyl he's taking to write a tweet like this if you want to better your life i think you would start by not using drugs and trying to buy stuff with fake money and resisting arrest from police officers i don't know what world we live in why are these people so lame they're just lying they're just making up stuff to stoke hatred in vitriol in our country that guy was a thug that guy was a criminal that guy was using drugs he's not an example of anybody he don't represent me as a black man and i hate that i want to point that out i hate when people say to me how do you not see yourself in in george how do you not see your brother i don't know my brother and my cousins aren't ingesting fence no resisting why would i see myself in george floyd why would what person goes i really see myself in this drug addict and this person that's been arrested and faced jail since nine times why would i see why am i forced to see myself because oh we have a similar melanin complexion it tells you what they think of you though yeah they feel that's representative well and his name is now forever synonymous with justice according to our speaker of the house how little must they think of the american people to have that as the hallmark of everything we should be looking towards to better our life and the end goal of where we should achieve things yeah what happened to the lady that he had at gunpoint that they did a home invasion where is that justice what happened to the people you know who he probably was selling drugs to what happened to his family he's in he's in another city his family don't live there where how is this man the spokesperson of justice yes how is the movement today synonymous with justice when you look at what martin luther king did they didn't beat beat people up kill people burn buildings louis vuitton they weren't doing those things yes justice has gotten a makeover since the time of martin luther king i'll tell you that for sure and it's it's it's really despicable to see the way they are mischaracterizing him i don't care how what you think about him whether you think that that derrick sherwin should have been guilty the idea that this man should be held as a hero should be sickening to every single american you know everywhere i go this is true i travel a lot everywhere i go i meet black women particularly who are starting businesses who are becoming medical professionals who are going into other professions and really heroically building businesses why why aren't they a story why isn't that a tale to tell instead of the fact that we ignore the fact that women every one of these guys who've been shot recently has abused a woman at some point stuck a gun in a woman's face dante wright did it they all they've all done this and nobody cares nobody seems to care the names of these women are forgotten the stories are forgotten no one interviews them and it's just it just seems that there's an entire uh i i bet a majority of the black population who are becoming everything you want an american to be but they don't want to see it right and now instead we want to we want to honor failure i think i think that's where society is going and somebody brought up a very good point to me earlier they said i said where is this going you know why do you want the police to suddenly you know not what would be the purpose of policing there's no incentive to become a police officer today so why do we see this push by the mainstream media and democrats to make it almost impossible to become a police officer today and they offered that maybe the end goal is really because they want to instill uh to install a federal police force yeah right because there's going to be no place so now it's going to have to be the government the federal police force that will be knocking on your door uh you know demanding you to do things it almost seems like we're treading in that direction it wouldn't be surprising to me one bit at all and i do have to say we owe all of our police officers such a debt of gratitude they are not thanked for their service enough and of course there are bad people in every profession that's a very logical conclusion to come to but i think conservatives lately have been painted as worshiping police officers and assuming they can never do anything wrong while the left has attacked all of them universally as pigs as people who should be murdered as people who no longer deserve our respect and our thanks so if you're watching this and you're a police officer thank you from the bottom of our hearts for everything that you're doing but common sense police reform thank you this isn't a partisan issue this is not a left versus right issue or a liberal versus conservative issue this is an idea of protecting our communities regardless of what you look like and circling back not to borrow a phrase from our white house press secretary to andrew clavin's point you know we are living the american dream regardless of what you look like more in 2021 than ever before people are starting businesses they're creating their dreams into a reality they're sending their kids or themselves to school for the first time you never hear about that no from the left side of the aisle and instead you hear our president say we have systemic racism exactly and one of the problems that the left has is that leftism actually doesn't work every time it's tried it makes things worse the homelessness gets worse the poverty gets worse the inequality gets worse and under leftism you only have the poor and the powerful that's all you have we're under capitalism you have this greatest step they've got to distract us they've got to be telling us that we hate each other they've got to make us hate each other they've got to try they've got to do all this stuff to keep our eyes off the fact that it doesn't work all you have to do is let people be free all you have to do is let them build their businesses cut their taxes a little bit draw back on the regulations this country just explodes with creativity the media is is exploding with the need to lie about everything that's happening in this country and and it's interesting because as i say the lie makes its way around the world before the truth even gets up out of bed and puts its shoes on right and one of those big lies that brennan you and i tackled us from the beginning black lives matter this incorporation right you know this is a corporation where does the money go i have been screaming this for years that this is a fraudulent organization that seems to use the faces of black people to raise millions and millions and nobody knows where it goes but this week briana taylor's mother spoke out and actually said well candace and brandon have been screaming for weeks and here's what she said i actually want to read it for baiting because it's so powerful and it's basically being ignored she said i have never personally dealt with black lives matter louisville and personally have found them to be fraud frauds i think she meant attica scott is another fraud okay shien says i could walk in a room full of people who claim to be here for briana's family who don't even know who i am i've watched y'all raise money on behalf of brianna's family who has never done a damn thing for us nor have we needed it or asked so talk about fraud i've been talking about fraud ma'am i've been talking about fraud i mean brandon hello vindication for you and i yeah i mean this is you know a blind man can see this you know that they are fraudulent you can look in the black community they have been doing this quote-unquote work for a very long time but nothing has changed they don't even prescribe any change you see young girl a young girl the other day jazlyn i think her name was jazlyn she got murdered seven-year-old girl got murdered in a car they don't even put her on their instagram page they're talking about that they don't even they do none of those things they won't even mention tyshon lee which was another young nine-year-old that was murdered i mean he was murdered directly by gang members they won't even speak about it one day i hope one day that we people will step up and actually help where the help is needed go to the inner city and go and march and stand in front of somebody's house that's selling dope in the in the community stand in front of the person's house who murdered that little seven-year-old i want y'all to protest there stop protesting about these police officers that'll justify these shooting people right i mean it makes my blood boil now i would keep talking but it's not my no no i love it i love it and what i want to say also is just that this idea that america is systemically racist like what this really allows and i i do want to show the quote i actually want to show the video of joe biden saying this but what it really allows for them to do is to basically say our problems can never be solved so we need more and more and more and more government so let's look at president joe biden it was a murder in the full light of day and ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism the vice president just referred to there were systemic races as a stain on our nation's soul the knee on the neck of justice for black americans profound fear and trauma the pain the exhaustion and black and brown americans experience every single day i wish that that joe biden could meet senator joe biden who's the guy who passed the law yeah was in the ku klux klan robert byrd it was a grand cyclops or the senator joe biden who passed the law the three strikes policy i mean i wish that guy could meet the other guy it would be amazing how i mean disingenuous how disingenuous is this clip oh it's the whole thing this whole attitude that this was somehow ripped the blinders off like we never knew there had been race problems in this country before you know this is a this is a country that was doing so much it's weird it is weird that barack obama's election was the turning point that when you asked when people were polled they said on both sides they said race relations were improving when obama was elected people even i who didn't like obama or agree with obama thought it was a kind of a beautiful thing that given our history that we now had a black man as president and yet i think again because leftism doesn't work because nothing obama did work because he set the middle east back on fire after had been pacified because he sat on the recovery i think he had to start using the race card to distract from the fact that leftism doesn't work if just once they would just say you know what i need a better idea we can get rid of a lot of the stuff because all of it is to distract us from the failure of their policies and sadly this is kind of being institutionalized now because kids are learning this and i know isabel you do a lot of work in this space and talked about you know your experience in a college campus as a conservative but there just seems to be this pollution of minds that all they want children to think about is race and before uh earlier today i actually had a friend reach out to me her daughter attends a boarding school in connecticut and after the the trial verdict was read this is what they sent out to all of the kids i actually could not even believe um and i'm not going to obviously read this an entire letter but it says for many the state of minnesota versus derek michael shovin has been a stark heart-wrenching reminder of the suffering one human being can inflict on another it has also been a painful reminder that racism still permeates and threatens the everyday lives of marginalized marginalized groups in this country can one of you guys help me what was the element of the derek chovin trial that was proven to be about race still have yet to answer that question one piece but you're right critical race theory is the cancer of education that's now effectively indoctrinating this entire generation of young americans that are now going to grow up and take that beyond school so beyond elementary school beyond middle school and high school and their college campuses into whatever realm of american society they work in the halls of congress a corporate boardroom america's streets genuinely believing it is our duty and responsibility and it is morally correct to view people differently based on their skin color to believe that white people have had this inherent advantage in our country forever they still do and black people are always inherently disadvantaged that is actually verbatim the curriculum taught by the new york times 1619 project which is now taught in every chicago public schools school and many other school districts across the country but here's the million-dollar question that nobody has been asking throughout this process this concept of systemic and institutionalized racism if it really exists let's examine every system and institution in american culture today higher education in academia big tech large corporations hollywood the music industry movies everything that permeates our culture daily all the way up to the federal government is all controlled by the left right so if there's really systemic and institutionalized racism as our president of the united states says who's really at fault to blame that is a great great question and brandon like if your child was at this school and this letter went out knowing your perspective what would you do oh i'm gonna act the food i'm gonna go up there and act the food they're gonna call the police on me and everything you know which is your opportunity to become a victim by the way all right gonna get some money out of this but this is unacceptable you don't brainwash kids like this let me tell you this the people who are teaching their kids to love this country and to be accountable for your actions they are succeeding you are succeeding i'm succeeding when you look at this stuff if you teach your kids to be a victim their entire life they will be the bombs walking around with no job being a permanent activist they're not going to own businesses they're not going to make it up the corporate ladder nobody's going to hire these people i will never hire somebody that's sitting around making excuses when i hire people i do interviews and i talk to them what value do you bring to the table if you say something stupid like systemic racism i will never hire you this is a complete lie and the reason why they say it's systemic is because they never plan to fix it they wanted to be the boogeyman that they never fixed if you say the court system is racist pick the judge and you show me that racist judge and have them fired if you say our country is inherently racist joe biden who probably can't remember the old joe body because he's brain dead joe biden how about you step down mr white supremacy how about you step down if white people are the problem and give a black person your spot they will never do that because they're steady line and they just want to push a narrative that will never be successful he just might do that because kamala harris is always just behind him i know every time he's speaking right so those could be those could be famous last words and and i will say i would i think it really is time to talk about pulling kids out of school and i am not being funny when you study world war ii and you study exactly what hitler youth was and what they were trying to do to make sure that the children that were being produced in the school systems in germany were coming out with these perspectives that would only help the government grow that is what is taking place in america right now these kids are being informed they're being polluted with these perspectives that are not true because they want these kids to come out of school and they want them to be warriors for the government because that's what these kids are doing they know when they're rioting and looting and maxine waters is saying they want them to be soldiers for the government and it is dangerous ideology and i do want to bring up this guy uh um you may have seen it in the news incredible a father pulled his child out of nyc's 53 thousand dollars a year brewerly school whose pupils include chelsea clinton's daughter slams it as woke weaning agenda and says it's teaching kids what to think i think this man is a hero he is you know and this is this is a very very fancy private school this is a funnel to the ivy league when my i've sent my kids to school in the 80s and 90s when i took one look at public schools i resolved that i would do anything beg borrow or steal to put them into private schools to keep them out of the government schools i was telling isabelle i wrote one of the worst horror movies ever made one missed all zero percent on rotten tomatoes folks but it put those kids through three years of private school because i wanted the power to walk in and say what this guy said i wanted to say if you don't teach my kid what he needs to know we're out of here and we're taking our money with us and that's that's why he's here yeah and and that's the sad part is they're paying to have their children brainwashed it's the college university system well the sad reality is this is happening in every school in america virtually every college campus every public school every private school unless your child is homeschooled or attends an overtly conservative charter school i guarantee you they are being taught at least a percentage of this leftist indoctrination and it's not just critical race theory by the way they're actively teaching kindergartners now that you should be questioning your gender identity your gender might be different from the private parts that you were born with and by the way here's a children's picture book anti-racist baby written by one of the co-founders if you say it enough time it will become true right they say it enough times men can be women and women can be men it's supposed to just become true magically no one's allowed to question the narrative because it's true and eventually we're going to get to the point where people will be rioting and looting because this is the true narrative that the media has decided upon and it is absolute filth and it's also depressing which is why now we have to interject a fun topic of the week and what i picked for this fun topic of the week is amazingly demi lovato please tell me you're following this absurd story demi lovato you know act of real bravery real bravery calls out la frozen yogurt shop for selling sugar-free options it's not good she walked in she said are these sugar-free options no this is not okay for you guys to be selling this because it is not good for for my body positivity it is not good for me she said finding it extremely hard to order froyo from at the big chill official when you have to walk past tons of sugar-free cookies and other diet foods before you get to the counter do better please hashtag diet culture vultures not all heroes wear capes important actors have a hard time this is the this is the future civil rights issue this is our nation yeah no question if this is not really emblematic of just how privileged american society is i don't know what it's like demi just don't have the ice cream or eat it you know what i mean like we don't really need to be involved in this process of you pretending like they just want to see things that are wrong everywhere like they can't be happy not even when they're getting literal ice cream these are the the dumbest people that have ever existed in humanity are living today i i do are we living in real world situations like what what world are we living in where people are complaining about sugar-free options that sounds to be healthy or at least an option for you if you want to choose it you don't want to go to the business start your own business if you have a problem these people complain about everything sugar-free if there's not enough black people on staff i mean god i can't i don't understand what's happening when i was growing up we weren't this stupid what i love is the comic relief of the fact that they're both stupid and they despise you right it despise everybody else and why why what you know don't they understand that like they think they think you're stupid but that's how dumb they are i just can't imagine waking up and just looking for reasons to be oppressed so much that i can't walk into an ice cream shop in order without whipping out my phone and being like i need to tweet about this because it's so dangerous they have a diet option like and she does this routinely by the way celebrities do this all the time they make everything about them and their oppression i mean when dmx died don't forget demi lovato came out and said it could have been me i mean i feel like they're constantly trying to be the center of attention and they're just at the end of the day miserable human beings and nothing will ever make them happy including ice cream that is all the time that we have today guys keep up with these three on social media and don't go away we'll be right back uh you know i always wanted to know what it felt like for whatever reason they always dance when they come out the ufc fighters let me just say the man who needs no introduction the president of the ufc welcome thank you thank you so the the ufc has become one of my favorite pastimes for a lot of a lot of reasons and i do love the dances they do on the way in uh you guys have just exploded over the last few years what what do you think it is like what is going on that it's just been like ufc yeah well first of all we're the most exciting live sporting event there is if you've ever been to one life it's great on tv fun to watch on tv but it's even better live and uh we've been aggressive in taking this thing everywhere you know when you think about what boxing did over the last 30 or 40 years they do atlantic city madison square garden every once in a while and a lot of vegas we took this thing everywhere every major city in the country uh in into other parts of the world and uh you know really focused on the live event and getting television deals and i i think that the fact that i had pushed so hard to go through covid um really helped us a lot too right you're so right there is something that is so unique and i can only describe it to people who have not been to a ufc fight but i went to my first fight last year didn't know what to expect and i am telling you when i was sitting on the side of the octagon like there is just i can't even explain the energy that courses through your body like eventually i'm gonna have to pay you to get rid of the tape of the things that came out of my mouth when i was like i heard i heard you were going get up get up destroy him like and i was just going this is not who i am afterwards i was like i don't know what got into me but there is something about it that it's it's almost primal these these these fighters are amazing athletes i don't think people understand they're like machines yeah no they're they're super talented they're incredible athletes um a lot of their stories are really cool most of these guys went to college and graduated you know they're not stereotypical fighters what you would think an ultimate fighter is they're the exact opposite it's and we saw that early in in the in the athletes and in the sport and it's part of what we sell right exactly and actually speaking of incredible stories you actually have an amazing story and and people don't often hear it but you weren't a person that had tons of opportunities in your life and you've turned this into quite the industry can you talk a little bit about your personal background um yeah you know i i grew up my family's from boston um my mom was a single mother we moved to uh vegas in um 79 or 78 or 79 in that ballpark because they were pit my mom was a nurse and they were paying nurses more than anywhere else in the country so that's why we moved to vegas and uh you know i went to school there for a couple years then went and lived with my grandparents in maine and ended up back in boston and when i was uh 18 years old i was a bellman at the boston harbor hotel and uh one day i was standing in the lobby and i was like what the hell am i doing here you know it was good money you know great hotel great place to work great place to stay uh they you know they had all the things that you think you want in life you know i made tips you made good money every day they had a 401k health insurance all those things but i just said this isn't me this isn't what i want and uh i literally walked out the door and quit and uh what was that moment that was there a specific thing that happened or just in your head you just said i'm done with this yeah i always wanted to be i loved fighting and i always wanted to be in the fight business and i'll never forget it as long as i was standing in the lobby one day you know that is your you work at a hotel you got to stand up against the lobby like this wait for pete can i help you with your bags you know that i'm like i literally said what the hell am i doing here why why am i doing this i talk about that so often it's it's almost a mentality switch when you can just kind of say to yourself i don't want to i don't want this for my life anymore right and you did this 100 and i tell people all the time you know people say what's the worst thing that can happen the worst thing that can happen is not trying not trying is the worst thing that can happen if everything failed then none of it worked out you go back to work i mean you can go get a job like that any day of the week um you know and i'm 19 years old at this time and uh you know everybody's telling them what are you going to do what are you going to do i want to get in the fight business you know and then you hear how stupid that is you know it's the dumbest thing anybody's ever heard um but it was what i wanted to do was what i knew that no matter what happened when i got out of bed every day i was going to be happy doing what i you know going to work and doing what i love to do yeah it's interesting now because you see what i'm seeing starting to shift now is that so many so many celebrities attend these you know these these are sitting uh i would say octagon side right octagon side are sitting octagon side and it's sort of becoming a cultural thing it's it's just so interesting to see what you've been able to do with the ufc um and and you definitely deserve all of the success and i have to ask you what are you making right now just talking about a popular thing that people are talking about right now of the jake paul challenging the ufc fighters what is your perspective on all that well the thing is in this business is it it's all about showmanship i mean if you look at conor mcgregor and how he exploded uh the floyd money mayweather and you know what he was able to do and turn himself into you know the the kids of showman and he's he's calling out ufc people um to get more attention you know the kid's making money and you know can he fight i doubt it i mean if if you look at what he's done this isn't gonna last long yeah but he's going to make some money yeah so you think you think it's more of a gimmick it's an absolute gimmick yeah and these these athletes like i said the mma guys they just it's day in and day out it is just such a grind people i don't think people understand what it takes uh you know to to be in the octagon and and you know how much of their lives they're giving up just dedicated to this sport day in and day out and it's it's a life you know it's a lifelong commitment it's not something that you just wake up one day and go i'm just going to jump in jump in the octagon and try to be a fighter you know right so it's it's incredible stuff yeah no these type of athletes are wired different than anybody else you know that they're so different in that these are people that will never sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic to go to work we'll never sit in a cubicle and listen to somebody telling them when they can go to lunch what time they gotta be back to just they're not built that way and uh you know i i've heard throughout my career sometimes i'll i'll hear people say well i'm i feel bad for them that they have to fight for a living i said well that's funny they feel bad for you you have to get up and go to work every day and have some 22 year old kid tell you what to do and what not to do and you know so they're just they're different human beings that's why they're fighters i think the ufc in general is different and i wanted to actually point to this moment because it was actually one of my favorite sports moments last year um and you probably barely even remembered it because it probably didn't even hit your register but it meant i think so much people that are watching and i think that it's a big contributing factor to the success of the ufc so i remember uh the fight uh it was tyrone woodley and versus uh colby covington who's a friend of mine um and i remember watching the two of them just looking so opposite you know one of them you've got tyron woodley he comes in he's like black lives matter blocks my black lives matter and then you've got colby he comes in and he's like maga maga mega you know donald trump supporter like and you know it's like they're all they're talking trash each other like they always talk trash to each other and i remember uh in an interview afterwards there was a journalist that was like trying to bait you sort of into just making a comment or you know picking one side or the other maybe and you completely didn't take the bait and i actually want to throw up the quote that you said you said these guys all have their own causes things their own beliefs we don't muzzle anybody here we let everybody speak their minds i'm not going to play these games with you guys i mean can i just give like an amen to that i can't tell you i can't tell you how refreshing it is because it just i think especially for americans right now it feels like there's just nothing that we can enjoy like we can't just like say now it's just a fight and these are the individuals that are fighting it feels like there always has to be you know a corporate strategy or corporate and we just don't really want to hear it and so it was just it's been a breath of fresh air of the ufc well thank you i appreciate that and i agree with you it's like we live in this world right now where nobody's allowed to have their own opinion you know am i going to let tyron come in and talk about black lives matter am i going to let him talk about mega and somebody everybody has a car these are all grown men and women that fight for us they all have their own beliefs their own politics or whatever it is they can say whatever they want to say you know to a point i mean there's sometimes some things cross the line but at the end of the day too this is the fight business guess what we say really mean things to each other that's how this works you know what i mean and it seems to be an adrenaline frame so so i can't say something mean to you but i'm going to punch you in the face tomorrow and i'm going to try to knock you unconscious right but it seems like god forbid you say something mean to the other i know and i said it's exciting you know because everyone obviously knows it's not i mean it's not that they're saying it's just it's almost like they're hyping themselves up and they're getting excited and uh it's it it just thank you i think i think for everybody watching this thank you for keeping the ufc apolitical and allowing people to just be individuals well i also believe that that when you watch sports right you're you're tuning in to get away from all the all the crap that's going on in your life whether it's you know personal professional political whatever is going on in the world that's your time when you tune in never once did we talk about covid we didn't talk politics we didn't talk about anything negative that was going on when you come in and you watch two or three hours of our fights you're tuning in for fights you're coming in to watch a sport you want to hear all that crap watch any other channel any time walk anywhere it's true exactly true and that is so true as well and you know kobit 19 of course we understand this is going on but it is so true that there needs to be something that americans people all over the world can turn to that allows them to turn off the noise and the bad news right and and we we have to i think do a better job i think corporations need to do a better job of remembering that the individual opinions of individual people fine they can all have their individual opinions but can we just have can we have some fun can we have some good things that are untouched and and not marred um by what feels like just a political takeover at all times of every day so kudos to you guys you have some fights that are coming up thanks yeah let's see so this saturday i'm leaving here and flying to jacksonville we're going to be the first uh back with a full arena we sold out in jacksonville thank you if you're watching this guys and you have not yet been paying attention to the ufc i am telling you there's just something about it i didn't know what i was doing was at the fight but i was like i need to be back i want to be back every single time like this is this is a sport for us america we can we can just partake in something turn our brains off and just enjoy uh you know being on the side on the sidelines we sold out in jacksonville we sold out in houston and we sold out in vegas three back-to-back fights 50 000 tickets the all three combined sold in less than five minutes and i i think what that means is people are done people are done people are done man they're ready to get back you know i'm gonna pack this place you know with people and we're going to put on fights on saturday you know there's going to be that buzz that energy that camaraderie that people feel again about being around fifteen thousand people and just wanna exploring something together yeah i love that so much and you're right people are ready to have fun again i'm ready to have fun right now we are going to play a game with you it's a fun superlative game don't worry i'm not going to get you into trouble i always say that but i always get people in trouble um it's it's a fun superlative game super simple uh we're going to put up a bunch of celeb photos and you were just going to crown the winner of each category are you ready first up is the most overpaid is it kim kardashian oscar de la hoya or justin bieber this is the yearbook listen you can be as big of a hater as you want you can't deny justin bieber's super talent so talented i appreciate that i agree oscar de la hoya needs some rehab money so we'll let him keep his money i'll go with kim kardashian as the overpaid the most overpaid person all right kim you won that round next up what is the reality show that candace owens is most likely to be on is it a the great british bake off b fear factor or c real housewives you like that right be a great housewife i'm gonna go a fear factor you know yeah you're tough i'm tough but the roaches that they eat i would be out the door so fast anything rats or roaches i turn into like a little weenie baby i'm like i can't do it i can do it i couldn't eat anything yeah nothing right i'm like who is tough enough that they're like i'm going to do so i respect those people i think i'd make a really good housewife all right this is a great one people are wondering at home between conor mcgregor and st pierre who is the best dressed ufc fighter outside the octagon oh that's that's a no-brainer conor mcgregor dresses better than me when he goes to the gym so he does this even on the way out oh my god does he i like that yeah i have to agree with you i think he is so well dressed and actually he's going to be fighting soon yes he's back i'm very vegas july 10th in vegas he's one of the ones i assume are sold out yeah yeah he's an incredible fighter and just honestly i think just i have so much resp respect for these athletes and everything that you're doing um i just cannot say enough for everybody who is watching this if you are looking for a way to turn off and watch a sport that you can deeply appreciate please you have to start watching the ufc cannot thank you enough dana white for being here you're a hero to me thank you in my book you're a hero and likewise keep up with dana on social media and stick around because i am answering your questions next one of my favorite parts of every episode is that i get to answer questions from you at home all of you on social media and right here in the live studio audience i never get to see these questions beforehand so the answers are organic unfiltered just me let's get ready let's do it okay this question is from maddie she asks on twitter how do you foresee the biden harris administration playing out in the long run love your show by the way you are one of my ultimate female role models by the inherent harris administration the fact that you are writing biden and harris administration is really all you need to know we never called it the trump and pence administration did we we always said the trump administration and yet it seems like there has been this purposeful intention from this administration to always combine joe biden with kamala harris and what seems inevitable to me is that this is going to end and just be a harris administration because i i do not believe and i know that many americans feel this way um that joe biden is uh i guess i'll say ripe in his mind um and i think that it's it's almost inevitable and almost a guarantee that it's going to end with they're going to say first black female president kamala harris and it makes me sick to say that um but that is just where i see things going on top of that just in terms of what's going to happen in the country i think we're moving closer and closer um you know economically to a form of socialism um you know looking at what they did in terms of passing the the trillion dollar covet 19 bailout it shouldn't even called copen 19 anything um because the bulk of everything that was in there was just really securing billions and billions of dollars for the government down the line sending it off to different states um almost guaranteeing that we're selling our future down the line economically i just don't see um how our grandchildren are not going to suffer based on some of the decisions that have been made under this administration but you know we we have to hope for the best i have to be hopeful and hope that in 2022 the republicans are going to take back the house and we are going to be able to put a stoppage to a lot of this nonsense next question what's the best piece of advice you've ever received that is from kelly in nashville uh easy i always say this to people that follow me the best advice i've ever received is you are the average of the five people that you spend most of your time with so if you are hanging out with four people and they are losers and they do drugs they don't want to do anything and they're unmotivated you will become that average if you are hanging out with people that are much smarter than you um you will become that average if you're hanging out people that are much richer than you you will become that average if you hang out um with whoever it is just see yourself as the average it actually is kind of a story of how i began my entire career i was getting so frustrated about politics and i kept arguing with this absolute idiot from my hometown eventually i realized that i was spending about two and a half hours a day on facebook just arguing with this guy and i said to myself he's bringing down my average if i want to spend time arguing i should be creating some content for myself and lo and behold i decided to launch a youtube channel and the rest is history actually the rest is future so next question we have joey pinkert what's the process with the fact-checking lawsuit against zuckerberg very nice play i'm sure that was a typo he meant zuckerberg uh the we have already had oral arguments the first step as you guys know for those of you that are watching i am suing the facebook pack checkers and uh we had back in february the first oral arguments they want to get the case dismissed um and the judge has come back and asked for more oral arguments which are supposed to be taking place in two weeks um you know everything the indication that we have is that this case is going to go forward but of course you never know but i think it's a good sign that the judge requested more arguments against um usa today i'm doing usa today and i'm suing lead stories and we have a very strong suit uh great question i'll continue to keep you guys updated when i have something more substance thank you guys so much i hope we have given you something to think about thanks for joining us we'll see you next week thank you so much you", "Djy7kTHyewc": "Joe Biden's non-binary drag queen nuclear waste Guru in case you missed it remember the picture the photo of the guy that was wearing heels and I guess he had something to do with um what was that stuff that he was involved in puppy play he would dress up and it was some weird fetish that he had well it doesn't matter because he is working for your tax dollars are going to support him I guess is the best way to say it his name is Sam Britton and his full title is the Doe's Deputy assistant Secretary of the office of spent Fuel and waste disposition and he's now been accused of taking a bag he was caught on camera stealing a bag from minneapolis's airports baggage claim and if he's found guilty he could face five years in jail a ten thousand dollar fine or both and I want to be very clear he's not going to face any of that because Hunter Biden is roaming the streets freely Eddie's a crackhead who's got pornography on a laptop and so I mean I don't even is the idea that anybody connected to Joe Biden is ever going to be made an example of or that they're ever going to have to face up for their crimes is a long-running joke at this point but if he actually did have to pay for his crimes that's what it would be uh you know this guy as I said proudly announced on LinkedIn that he had become the assistant Secretary of spent Fuel and he's been very in our face but yes they caught him on October 27th taking a bag a navy blue hard sided roller bag from a baggage claimed Carousel and the bag was reported missing by a woman earlier in the day after reviewing a lot of the surveillance videos she was able to identify the bag with a total value of items stolen approximately 2 325 dollars now listen maybe he had the wrong bag he saying that he didn't and that when he opened the bag it was his clothes that is his defense for it she is certain that it is her bag obviously because there are cameras everywhere in the airport we will eventually be able to get to the bottom of the story but I don't want to say this I mean relative to the crimes that Joe Biden is committing in our face I say leave Sam Britton alone if he accidentally took somebody's bag and it wasn't purposeful okay so here is why the story is a strange one it's strange because Brenton was in the airport having arrived in a flight from Washington DC but he didn't check a bag so he didn't check a bag so why would he go to baggage claim to collect a bag if he hadn't checked one so law enforcement was were able to quickly track him down and he denied it he completely denied taking anything which is weird because when you at least oh no I took a bag but it was my bag so that's the mix-up this is this is my bag I need to open and go actually it's all back at all so after denying it then he had to change a part and he called the airport police they said okay actually no I I lied a little bit um I wasn't being completely honest I did take a blue bag from the airport again he never checked a bag in so it's completely bizarre that he lies and says he took nothing now he's coming clean and saying okay I did take a bag and it's it's getting a little weird right so now he's saying that he was just a little tired and he took the suitcase thinking that maybe it was his even though he didn't check a bag sounds like he might be a liar and by the way this is a very weird thing how crazy you have to be just going to take a flight right get off of a plane now how tired do you have to be to stand at baggage claim okay and think that you checked to wait for a bag that you never checked to take it and then to forget that you took it and lie to law enforcement and take anything and then called them and say oh just kidding I did take something but I'm not I'm not really sure why why I took it this is just weird it's weird it's bizarre paper it's almost like he's crazy and if you didn't think he was crazy because the suitcase thing you should probably think he's crazy because he's got a weird puppy fetish so people usually tell you they have mental disorders early on I'd say a red flag is dressing yourself like a puppy on your hands and knees wearing heels to work for the government that might have been a red flag and he's got some other mental issues and one might be another fetish fetish is jumping into carousel eight and grabbing a blue bag and pretending you didn't because you were tired now I know tired I'm a mom okay I've traveled on flights with two toddlers with one toddler and a newborn with absolutely no sleep overseas never once when we landed never once did I go to a baggage carousel after having not checked a bag and taken somebody else's and then forgot I didn't I told the police no it wasn't me so this guy's probably gonna lose his job if things are right in the world but they're not right in the world so he's probably gonna get a promotion from Joe Biden promotion and an astounding defense from Joseph Biden who probably doesn't even know that he works for him all right you guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you're not

was on Saturday Night Live his personal life was bigger than his character on Saturday Night Live in fact he just objectively not that funny Saturday Night Live always has been suffering from a lack of comedy and he I think was a part of this nothing that he really did was that funny and despite this the mainstream media has praised this guy since he got since he came onto the scene right he has been dating a ton of A-list beautiful women nobody really understands why he at first was dating Ariana Grande in fact he got engaged to her and then she broke off the engagement uh then he was dating Kaia Gerber who is a beautiful Top Model who's now dating Austin Butler he then was dating Kate Beckinsale a tiny bit older absolutely beautiful then I think the most notoriously began dating Kim Kardashian following her separation from Kanye and this sort of led to a mud slinging within the Press obviously I am bias but I think I am accurately biased which is to say that I think I'm on the right side here that I don't like Pete Davidson because of the whole Kanye Fiasco because it just points to the hypocrisy of the media uh the media was incessantly telling us that Kanye was crazy Kanye was crazy Kanye was crazy because he was obviously slinging a lot of mud at Pete Davidson who was publicly going all around with his still wife even though they were separated and you might think that's crazy except the Press declined to comment on the fact that Pete Davidson had gotten Kanye's children's named tattoo onto his body so what man in their right mind sees that you're dating his ex-wife or or his still wife but separated right for a couple of months and then you go and you extremely he got like six tattoos all of Kim and then it culminated he also got branded remember don't forget this one talk about crazy Kim Kardashian went on The Ellen Degeneres Show she said I have been brand that Pete Davidson got an actual brand of her on his body that's actually insane and it culminates into him getting a tattoo of all of her children's names all of Kanye's children's names Kanye reacts to that and the Press says it's Kanye that's crazy not Pete Pete's not crazy it's totally fine even though we know that Pete also went to a psychiatric hospital after he was dating Kaya Gerber he had some sort of a mental break with the Press protects him at all causes and makes it seem like he's just this amazing guy they always talk about how he just got a huge package it's very sexy very much sexualized him and all women should want him so I don't know what's going on or if he's got the greatest agent at CAA ever but he keeps dating more and more women that are very attractive and now he's with Emily rajkowski who is also just splitting from her husband after claims of infidelity she claims her husband has been Infidel of course Emily rajkowski has also been Infidel she's always naked on the internet I feel like I've personally had sex with her that's how many times I've seen her naked and yet somehow people think of her as a victim and now she's with Pete Davidson again I just I'm bringing this not because it's important but because this finds the presses the press the media Obsession I should say with Pete Davidson and trying to make us believe but he's just this totally stable guy who is just very attractive to very beautiful women I find it to be suspect it's something that I've just been tracking for a while and going something a little odd about Pete Davidson and that's all I'm going to say about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Trump who may be making a very big announcement tonight and I maybe received an invite so if you're not a

laying down some type of a defense uh obviously you guys know the entire background Harvey Weinstein the allegations against him fundamentally launched the metoo movement that we are still bearing the consequences for today a bunch of women came out and said women in Hollywood came out and said he waved to me me too me too me to me to me to me too and I have always had a lot of questions about that obviously we know that he was a huge power broker within Hollywood uh and I am just interested in the concept he was really disgusting to look at really ugly I've always been interested in what it was that gravitated these women to his house to his hotel room in some circumstances and to me because I know people that are in Hollywood I know for a fact that a lot of these circumstances are transactional I used to be really good friends with the girl that slept with a producer to get herself a part on one of the shows so she was ambitious but I bet if you asked her today she would still say she would look back on that time and she would say oh well I was just being used as an actress and so what we're basically saying is that there's no such thing as prostitution don't know if I believe that do you well I'll tell you who definitely doesn't believe it it's Harvey Weinstein's defense team and I'm going to tell you what arguments they are making when the defense faced the jury they urge the jury to use their common sense and realize that there is no forensic evidence such as such as a police report or a rape kit or DNA a semen sample or surveillance video of any criminal activity to back up the women's accusations each will boil down to believe me Weinstein's attorney said the victims if an accuser Waits years the allegation boils down to her word the prosecution plans to bring in a forensic psychiatrist to serve as an expert witness to educate the jury on rape myths which could explain some of these behaviors that are being described by Weinstein's defense Weinstein's attorney spent much of his time during opening statements focusing on Jane Doe number four who was recently revealed to be Jennifer Newsom Jennifer Newsom is yes in fact married to California governor Gavin Newsom and she was an actress and she is a director and she accused Weinstein of raping her in a hotel room in 2005. she has become a leading voice against sexual harassment and assault in recent years so Harvey wines these attorneys are talking about her and they said this she's made herself a prominent figure of the hashtag metoo movement he also listed her current accolades and status as the first partner of California but back in the early 2000s when Newsome was an aspiring actress and a filmmaker Weinstein's attorney says that she was a Hollywood wannabe he told the jury that during the alleged rape in 2005 siebel Newsom says that she faked an orgasm to end the assaults quickly Weinstein's attorney said there is no more enthusiastic signal of consent than yes yes yes which is why he says Mr Weinstein believed that she consented I don't care what you have to say about Harvey Weinstein as an individual I think he sucks I think he did broker his power to get what he wanted I think it was a total sleaze ball that's a good defense if she openly said that she consented but she was just faking her consent what what is the requirement here how is a man supposed to know that you're actually not consenting but you're faking your consent in the form of faking an orgasm with him and it is interesting that she also wasn't a spot an aspiring actress as I've said I I would have to speak about each individual person that went through this I actually personally have always believed that something happened to Rose McGowan and I was going to have her on my show a while ago but we didn't end up making it work uh but some of these women that jumped onto the metoo movement not so much I think some of these women were basically prostitutes were willing to do whatever it took to get the part and they were willing to you know undignify themselves and go so far as to sleep with this disgusting man and he took the power that was given to him he didn't care people did a deal with the devil and then when it became convenient and after they got what they wanted which is the defense's argument she got what she wanted and they even go on to say that she's been to his house since kind of compelling right you're the face of your you're claiming that this person sexually assaulted you why would you continue to ask him to contribute financially to your husband's campaign for governor throughout the years why would you allow him to host you as Harvey Weinstein did he hosted the newsomes as guests to his parties that to me you can say what you want but if you're a victim and you see somebody that is your rapist you do not go to their house when they invite you to go to their house it's just it's not something that doesn't seem like regular behavior and I know what you're gonna say that's victim blaming that's not it doesn't she you might want to hang out with your rapists for years and years and take pictures with them after you were raped and assaulted okay maybe I'm just saying that this is a very strong defense as I said to make it clear I still think Harvey Weinstein is a pretty disgusting grimy person but I also think that a lot of girl girls are operating under the hashtag me too who really just experienced some regret with some decisions that they made to get to where they're going and we as a society have to figure out how do we differentiate between the two because real rape victims are actually harmed when you have people that are willfully prostituting themselves and them regretting it saying like well this is rape too we need to be able to call rape rape we should not cheapen that evil by allowing girls that are just facing regret to use the same word rape all right I want to take a moment to talk to you

want to cover this story because it's creepy and it's weird and I guess it makes sense in the context that we have as I mentioned before a Supreme Court Justice contage katanji brown man I'm gonna get in trouble for saying that wrong and uh she has said that she doesn't know what a woman is what is scary is that we are starting to move toward a society in which we have a potential for artificial gestation and they just now successfully were able to raise a lamb for four weeks in a synthetic womb now this has again been something that has been discussed you know we don't even need women women this capability of giving birth who cares about that that's not what makes you a woman this is something that we say Obviously differences between men and women is that a woman is able to bring life and they are within our own wombs and men obviously are not able to do that within their own bodies well what would that argument look like if you had a technological advancement where a machine could just create life where you no longer needed women there is something incredibly dystopian about that it's it's a nightmare actually because the first thing that comes to my head and this has always sort of been in the back of my mind since we've been having this anti-family push in government since we've been doing IVF which we talked about another episode when I asked you your ethical opinions on IVF when I told you what actually happens to the woman's body uh what naturally goes to what goes to in my mind is that eventually we could be in a circumstance like in China when they had it in place it's no longer in place and they had the one child policy and the government said you were only allowed to have one child well what if the government determined whether or not you could have children full stop what if they start determining that women were not able to have children that you had to come to the government and ask them if you could have a child and use their artificial womb all of this might to you sound like dystopian nightmare that could never possibly happen I can promise you it can right as I said the first place that I could see something like this being implemented would be China without question right if they're spacing a shortage of women as they are now we know that China is having the storage woman because of this one child policy and people decided that they wanted more men and it's a huge reason why they are sex trafficking people over the Border in North Korea and in Korea well the reason that is going on is because of poor government policies and when there's poor government policies that have bad results what typically then happens is that more poor government policies uh are produced in their place to to deal with everything so this story makes me extremely uncomfortable I mean extremely uncomfortable it's something that you should watch it says that women who are infertile for medical or social reasons what that means may be able to conceive with the help of this emerging reproductive technology again I speak about this often in my personal capacity how we are seeing just an explosion of women that are struggling with fertility something about it is dark and Sinister in in my mind we have grandparents that were able to have 12 13 19 children seriously my grandfather was one of 12 and now just a couple of short Generations later I'm I am amongst a group of peers that are struggling to have one or two and it's not because they're trying to have kids at 40 it's because the first time that they try to get pregnant they are having issues and they're suffering from tremendous amounts of miscarriages we know that a lot of women spoke about the miscarriages that they suffered after they recently got vaccines and we know that a lot of these vaccines uh come with labels that say that it could fertility or my favorite phrase It's unknown whether or not it could impact fertility so I always have a question whether or not big Pharma is trying to create a circumstance in which women are unable to have children naturally and if this is where we are headed as a society because in the circumstance where women aren't able to get pregnant necessary able to get pregnant naturally you're obviously going to have a government that helps them keep an eye on that story alright guys the next portion of the show is going to be

first piece of advice would be to remind young women that thoughts become things what you put in your ear informs your thoughts it informs your ideas about what you think the world should look like and what freedom is right it is not freedom to wear less clothes in fact i would many ways would say that that's a form of slavery if the only time you feel like you can be heard and the only time you feel like you can be seen is when you are stripping down you are basically selling your dignity and your self-respect for a little bit of attention and in my opinion that's not a very good exchange", "lOFwJLktV78": "you have to imagine my surprise i rarely get duped by culture i know what hollywood is i speak about it all the time it's a form of idolatry it's a form of satanism it's unbelievable what these people will sacrifice you know for a little bit of fame and then you have a bunch of young children consuming it i know it i get it but even sometimes i get duped i found out recently that i was duped i have believed for a very long time the story of kim kardashian so we're gonna take this little culture conversation because you need to know what's going on because it matters as i said it's what what comes down the pipeline so those of you that know kim kardashian probably know one thing about her and that's that kim kardashian had a sex tape and then she became very very very very famous but for those of us that were consumers of culture and watched every minute of their very early episodes beginning 20 years ago we saw a different version we saw yes of course that there was a sex tape kim kardashian had sex with her then boyfriend his name was a rapper named ray j and that was in 2007 the tape surfaced and we watched her cry and be torn apart about this sex tape coming out against her will the the narrative was very simple she made the tape she gave her consent to make the video but she was young and she was on vacation with her boyfriend and then her jerk of a boyfriend ray j released that tape and then her mother intervened we were led to believe that he was legally allowed to give the footage to the porn industry and she was this woman victim and her mother intervened and basically said hey kim there's no way that you can stop this tape from coming out so at the very least make money off of it and she orchestrated a deal now that version of events sounds understandable you see her as a victim you see her mother as a bit opportunistic but what would be worse not making any money off of it and allowing people to click your name and what was the result kim kardashian is today a billionaire she turned this sex tape um into a billion dollar empire i've defended kim kardashian in circles and people say oh she's just fame hungry she's a disgusting person she's basically a pornographic actress i've come back and said look she was a young girl who was put into a vulnerable situation because she had a jerk of a boyfriend well it turns out that none of that is true and it's quite shocking to find out what the truth is so i'm going to tell it to you so that you know it and you are up to date on culture so kim kardashian is launching a new show with hulu the kardashians keeping up with them again on a different network and in the very early episodes she once again revisits the topic of this tape this infamous 2007 tape with news that there might be more footage that hasn't been released yet so once again the ex-boyfriend from hell has come back and he's got more footage and she's completely devastated about it so she calls her husband kanye west you guys know kanye west the rapper to deal with this trauma so you can take a look let me just call kanye really it's okay it's not okay though it's not you know on roblox you know say was on roblox yesterday and a thing popped up and he started laughing and i was like mommy look and it was a picture of my cry face and it was a game that someone made of roblox and it said kim's new sex tape when you clicked on it and thank god he can't read yet and it's like over my dead body is this gonna happen to me again i just want it gone so you hear this language over my dead body is this going to happen to me again kim kardashian is the victim she's crying feel bad for her guys this is sad she just wants to bury this she had nothing to do with this this is horrible you're supposed to be feeling feeling horrible with her how could a man do this well those were amber heard tears those were patrice colors of black lives matter tears i guess the theme of this entire last six months seems to be toxic women and kim kardashian and her mother sit among them what triggered ray j who has been in the background remember perceived for over a decade as this horrible person who released this tape was that she then makes an accusation that she doesn't know what extra footage she has but it could be something sexual so you're gonna have to forgive me for the language she uses here but this is what she said on her show this is supposed to be unreleased footage i really don't know what they have for 20 years this has been held over my head of this mistake or is it a mistake it was my boyfriend you know of years we go on a trip we film a video it's embarrassing for that to be out there but it's not the most scandalous thing and i'm not gonna be made to feel that way i'm just human didn't we deal with this the first season of keeping up this is a good omen you guys what's a good omen talking about your sex tape in the first season i feel like we're back to day one oh my god how am i it's a good oh man so what do we do marty marty let's say it's a brand new tip that kim doesn't even know exactly i mean i i'm 99 sure but the fact that these people keep saying they have a tape what if i was sleeping and he stuck a dildo up my ass i don't know like like i'm saying i hope you would wake up i don't remember so this little portion represented the final straw for ray j who has been sitting back silently allowing her to build her empire allowing people to falsely believe that she was a victim here did she ever directly say ray j released it no but it was heavily implied in the press and she never said he didn't release it it just she was a victim it somehow got released of course the assumption any person making their mind was that it was ray j but this comment the idea that he could sexually assault her while she was asleep really made him angry he decided to come out with the truth and the truth is astonishing the good news is that it's summer and that means pool time and that means grill time and if you are one of people that has good ranchers in your fridge that means making your meal time easy convenient and less stressful now they even have

goodranchers.com candace the truth ray j speaks out to the press and he says that the truth is that she is the person that kept the leaked sex tapes in a nike shoe box under her bed ray j speaks after 14 years in the shadows to reveal the second tape does exist but she has the only copy and he accuses the kardashians of making billions from abusing my name now in this article when you read it if you find out that actually kim kardashian and ray j and her mother plotted the release and the sale of this tape it was a casual conversation back when she was about 23 years old with ray j dating him they saw that paris hilton that her fame went up after she had a sex tape and ray j said he turned to kim and said hey you should do that we should do that we'll make a sexy but it will make you more famous now in a regular american household you have that conversation with your boyfriend your instincts in your head don't go let me bring that to my mom that could actually be a great business opportunity but in the land of los angeles and hollywood narcissists and people that are actually insane and void of any morality this is a perfectly acceptable thing to bring to your mom so ray j and kim brought to her mom her mom called up her friends in the porn industry and they orchestrated a deal between the three of them for her to release her tape a mother orchestrating and plotting the release of the tape of her daughter's body right having sex on camera to help her become more famous i mean how absolutely despicable and saddening is that it's saddening it's actually saddening i'm i'm miffed at myself for having believed the story that she pitched for years that she was some victim of course i should see it this is what hollywood is you're looking at narcissists we can get narcissists that are trying to lead your children decisions that they should make you want to know why you see sex everywhere and this is what's coming down the pipeline it's been coming down the pipeline culturally sexist freedom or even better you can barter with sex you want some fame get naked get on camera sit down with your mom have her sit down with some hot and shows at vivid entertainment a porn industry and sell your body for fame i have lost absolutely all respect for kim kardashian for her fake tears over the year pretending that she had nothing to do with this deal she just issued no statement countering anything that ray j said and ray j is happy to be sued for really what he's doing now is he's blowing the nda that he's signed he doesn't care anymore he's like i don't care i'm done being painted as the bad guy i have kids now shame on all of us for believing in the victim narrative as women do through their press tears like this can't be happening to me again oh poor amber heard oh poor kim kardashian oh i'm a woman crying believe me hashtag believe me don't believe them this is where we're at in society because we have lost control of what it means to be in a family we have lost the responsibilities and the meaningfulness of family really at its core i'm talking just about family that nuclear family unit having a mother that would look at that and say have you lost your mind have you lost your mind did you just ask me if you could trade your body for fame i mean it really is just an incredible story that's what you need to know that's

perspective and you spoke at one of my blessed events my 501c3 not for profit and i was blown away by your speech i honestly think it was one of the best speeches i've ever heard on stage in terms of how inspiring it was for people that need to hear this message of like you can start anywhere from america we do have a clip and i do want to show it my mother and my father were both addicted to drugs over about 10 different foster homes i wanted to be a thug i wanted to gang bang well first of all i'm too small anyway so [Applause] i felt like i was a victim and a lot of people made me feel like i was a victim don't worry about it you're in foster care you have an excuse but to be honest with you there are no excuses we have the same opportunities that everybody else got okay you just gotta get up off your butt start walking through those doors the american dream is real we're from the foster house to the white house baby so you can't tell me black people don't have opportunities in america you can't tell me little black boys in the hood can never be anybody that's a dang love because i'm a free black man in america baby yes yes it's so great you know and and so you have had a tremendously difficult childhood and so every excuse has been handed to you at some point what was the thing that made you break away well excuses uh uh excuses didn't get me anywhere i mean excuses didn't do anything good for me you know like i said earlier there's a there is a uh there's a time in your life when uh where you have to start moving on and taking responsibility because i was playing the blame game oh i grew up in foster care having these excuses oh i'll never be oh i can't be a lawyer i can't be a doctor i can't be this because i didn't grow up like like like this child or that child you know but that didn't get me anywhere and i got tired of being broke so i was like you know i have to start chasing my dreams and doing what i love to do and that's when i started doing comedy you know just doing what i love to to do you know and did you realize something that i recognized and i'm gonna kind of tie people together you black person came from nothing worked your way to where you are me black person came from nothing worked up condoleezza rice clarence thomas and all of these people who have done so much and have had come from absolutely nothing and the second that they decide they can be something the people that claim to be so compassionate about the nothing that they come from instantly turn around and accuse you and me of being a white supremacist a traitor to your race because you found success and you don't see yourself as a victim what does that feel like for you you know what i was act i was honestly caught by surprise when i made my first video i reached about 7 million people in about in about 24 hours 7 million views in 24 hours it went super viral my first time ever going viral and i did not expect for people i didn't i did not expect for a lot of black people to attack me when i made that video i didn't think that people would attack me for i just i was speaking i mean i was speaking the truth you know this is the greatest country you know um so i was really surprised and i was i was at a loss for words to be honest with you but it's really but it's pretty disgusting because i thought that these people that screamed black oh black excellence oh you know uh and you you should support black businesses and and black men and black women i didn't get that support from them all because i was a conservative all because i supported president trump so i was really caught by surprise we'll get back to the show in just a second but first we need to talk about protecting your family memories every day vcrs and film

prop you know they they like to use you as a prop but if you if you deviate at all from whatever ecosystem they've created then they just go nope take that person out you're not allowed to exist we're not proud of you we're not proud of your progress terence of coming all the way from the foster home yeah they are not proud of black people that they cannot control right if they can't control you they will never be proud of you they have to control you you have to follow you have to follow after them you have to you you have you have to stand in line and do what they say when they say jump you supposed to jump when they you know you're supposed to say how high and if you don't say how high they don't support you anymore right you know they just throw you away yeah now i have a mother that spent some time in group homes and i know how um just how gnarly i guess to be the right adjective that that system can be and how much it affects people what was that experience like for you how long were you in in foster homes foster care and what was that experience i feel what'd you take away from that experience well the experience was pretty hard uh i remember going into my i don't know when i first went to the children's shelter but i do remember i started kindergarten in a foster home so i was pretty young and from that point on i was in and out of foster homes so my mother should get she'd get us back for uh probably a week then we're back in the system again so it was a back and forth thing until they took our rights away because uh i think his name was judge stewart i remember that name he he really he got tired of seeing us in in in in a family court and he wanted you know and he made a decision he said i want these children to have a better life and so he took her rights away which was pretty tough but i think he made the right decision interesting because i do love my mother but we did not deserve to go through that at all and for it to be back and forth you know so we didn't deserve to to uh struggle because we're children children don't deserve to be hungry they uh they need to be loved and taken care of and she could not do that so i think the judge made the right decision by taking her rights away and giving other families a chance to take care of us we will be back to the show in just a moment but first we need to talk about how you can be saving money

you still in touch with them over ten over ten over ten yeah were you did you age out of the system uh no i was adopted at the age of 15. oh were you adopted oh that's amazing i love that and i love my adoption yeah yeah so my mother she had nine of us my mother had nine of us and she she was addicted to crack cocaine uh so seven boys and two girls uh but also she did she also had grandkids my oldest sister was 11 when she had her first child oh my gosh she was 13 when she had her second child so my mother had all of us and two gr and two grandkids by her child wow her child had you know my sister was 13 with two kids so i mean it was it was devastating yeah and my oldest sister keisha she was taking care of us even though she was you know 13 11 and 13 she was 11. when she was 11 she was taking care of us because when my mother was out doing drugs and you know my sister would like steal her food stamps because my mother would sell them you know for for drugs so my sister she stepped in big time and helped us out and made sure that we was fed but then again she's only a child too so it's not like she could take care of us so it's a lot of it's a lot of dysfunction yes a lot of this is you know teen pregnancy uh drug addiction food stamps that must have actually informed your perspective of why you are a conservative because you must understand how just a destabilized family which is something that seems to be advocated for you know in the left you know less family no nuclear famine unit it's all going to be fine uh this push for their policies to have more drugs they want to make everything legal right and so now you you've seen something up close enough personnel and that must in some way inform yeah yeah all you know what family is important you need family a child needs his father and his mother and i'm and i was on and before i was adopted i was going down the wrong path and thank god that my adopted parents you know you know they they didn't play so terence my adopted father terence pull your pants up you look stupid [Laughter] you know like telling me stuff like that dude what are you doing like you are not a thug who do you think you are no you're not hanging around those people terence why are you going to the projects you don't live there you live with us so they and if i didn't have those people in my life i don't know where i would be at right now because you need a father figure and you need a mother in your life too you need both parents amen so family is very important thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you

people namely black lives matter the organization which my documentary has exposed they're they're dead now they're gone black lives matter is not a thing anymore I made sure that people understood what exactly was going on while our entire country was being torn apart by these racial narratives perpetuated by these reporters and their obsession with race everywhere well now my documentary the greatest lie ever sold has shown you where those dollars went where the 80 million dollars that they raised in under one year where it actually went and so I want to respond to some of you guys that have been tweeting at us and sending messages about the documentary it's been amazing to see the response and this is just the beginning so let's cover some of those responses this person at pro-life for all wrote the autopsy showed no injury to his neck holy beep why did I not know this right isn't that shocking how much information was kept intentionally from the public sphere they didn't want you to know the details of the case because they were so happy about this narrative the whole idea that he was on his neck and that he choked to death complete and utter crap and they knew it was crap next comment comes from at chickpea SP wrote please understand the message and the organization are not synonymous that drives me crazy actually last night I was doing an event and I talked about the tremendous difficulty that people have with just admitting they were wrong it takes a lot of courage to admit that you're wrong and the reason for that is because sometimes you go so far you're so far in your wrongness that you don't just want to completely scale back and say yikes I'm kind of really wrong here right this is sort of like the people that were deleting friends you didn't post a black Square I'm deleting you you're obviously a racist you voted for Donald Trump I'm deleting you people were commenting people that they've known their entire lives and accusing them of racism during the BLM summer of riots and protests right if they didn't kowtow to this Narrative of George Floyd so imagine you're one of those people and you put that pressure and you deleted your friends that you grew up with off of Facebook and Instagram and you made sweeping statements you created a status on Facebook that said if you don't support BLM die right imagine you did all those things now you see my documentary you're like oh yikes um maybe I went a little too far it takes courage to refrend those people to admit that you were wrong and to correct course cowardice though is just backing up a little saying oh well you know the the uh movement was different than the organization that is foolishness of course it was not different from the organization it was the free marketing firm for the organization people were donating because they were told that it was a way to rinse themselves of this horrific crime that happened to George Floyd that oh I'm not a racist I donated to Black lives matter because people were wearing BLM shirts and you were meant to put a BLM flag up right there is nothing that is different between this do not allow people to lean into the cowardice of Simply refusing to admit that they were wrong another message came from at my sunshine hn they wrote where is the money as a black woman I am ashamed of this organization they live by the misfortunes of others and this is a business for them that is correct and you should be outraged especially as a black person because it was black pain that was used for this narrative right they were willing to hide behind black people black people were their Shields that people wouldn't look at what they were doing behind the scenes next up is from at rmfire64 he writes wow just wow Candace I never liked Tegan at squishy Teigen but she and Jen Atkin and Dana Omari have shown themselves to be really bad people I was going to listen to this while painting but I can't take my eyes off the screen yeah it's pretty amazing if you watch documentary you will see that for whatever reason Chrissy Teigen just can't help it if there's a way to bully and to make someone feel bad and to try to drive someone to Suicide which she has done in other scenarios it seems that she likes to jump at the opportunity she's first in line and there are a lot of people that she could have bullied and no one would have paid attention to because she was hiding behind a black Square figuratively speaking well I paid some attention to it and I'm glad that you were equally as disgusted by what she did and what genatican did and what Dana Omari did next is from at baby blue TTU he wrote I thought this doc was great I also loved how Canada's personally helped Floyd's roommates that was the best part for me the interview with them speaking on that that was the most surprising part of the Journey of this documentary uh what you guys don't get to see is that we I particularly was terrified going into their house the team was on high alert we didn't know they didn't know that I was going to be interviewing them uh throughout much of this documentary particularly when we were in the autonomous zones I was wearing a bulletproof vest so the team was on edge we didn't really know what to expect they could have screamed at me they could have tried to hurt me or hit me and I was so so wrong so proven wrong they were so kind-hearted I I felt I remember walking out of the house and thinking wow those two individuals felt like they were my aunt and uncle like they felt like a family member to me and it allowed me to actually tell the story not from the place of somebody who is enraged at how this country was torn apart but as somebody who was actually feeling sympathetic that some people really lost a friend someone that they loved George Floyd was somebody that they loved irrespect irrespective of his flaws his tremendous flaws and I think that that is actually what made the documentary greater next from Mike Wayne I'm an African living in Zimbabwe and I fully support where you are doing Candace Black Americans need to wake up they don't know how good they have it here we survive on a dollar a day and two meals if you're lucky you just have been on strike for five years or more keep teaching them and I hope one day they will wake up yes it is true black Americans do not realize how privileged they are to live in this country and it's hard for them to recognize it when the media keeps telling them the exact opposite that you are not privileged at all and that your circumstances that you live in are not your own doing but the doing of some white supremacist narrative that is permeating throughout American culture and that simply is not true it is the lie that is disadvantaging black Americans and it is why African-American immigrants are always successful when they come to this country when weighed against the successes of black Americans who have been here forever so if this country was going to punish you based on the color of your skin right then wouldn't African immigrants be punished okay why are they doing so well next from s Moore he wrote it always blows my mind how people are allowed to go after Candace a black woman who speaks her mind and they say horrible terrible things about her things that if anyone said about any other person of color they would be blown off Twitter and Facebook in a heartbeat I guess it's the old thing if not for double standards they would have no standards at all that is true but I am used to it and I'm just glad that I'm able to be here and to show people how hypocritical they are to show them that they are not genuine in their intent to want to platform black Americans and just give them attention uh you know just give them a shot at success in America and to have black voices heard it's not true they want to use black American emotion to further their own causes and it is why they find me to be so problematic because I refuse to be a voice to anything but the truth ladies and gentlemen if you have not yet seen the documentary I hope you are realizing now that you need to exclusively on daily wire plus and so is the next portion of the show I'll be taught talking about the new video that just surfaced of Nancy Pelosi from January 6 on the day of January 6th so if you're not a member

said people in the arena created him greeted him pardoned like a legend both were attacked by social media mob why is the left still so neurotically obsessed with hating trump because the social media mob is not real it's an idea so it's a bunch of keyboard warriors that are pretending that they represent the majority and every once in a while the truth gets out which is that the majority of americans love donald j trump and so when that happens when the truth gets out there they have to attack it by any means necessary it's that they can continue to create um this false idea that america is a super woke leftist country i believe um in the bottom of my heart that the left is a very small radical bunch and they are perpetually threatened because the truth gets out eventually and yes the the arena went absolutely wild when donald trump walked out and i think even people that did not vote for donald trump are now realizing exactly what he was fighting for while he was in office because they are seeing this country turn into a place that they don't recognize we have never had a country that had censorship we have never had a regime in office that told you they were going to control the flow of information they've never had and people in office that said you're not smart enough to know what's information and what's not information pretending that you're fighting misinformation um so i think even people that didn't vote for trump are now experiencing a real awakening and recognizing that the media has been lying to them the mainstream media are not the good guys the mainstream media is working for the state um and that they are working for the department of justice and that all of those people are fighting against the american people because what they want at the end of the day is unbridled control of this country and we are not going to give it to them [Applause] thanks for joining me on this episode of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel

interviewing benjamin dictor he is a canadian trucker and a spokesperson for the freedom convoy and i have so much that i want to ask him please welcome me in joining benjamin dictor [Applause] all right benjamin i don't even know where to start because as you can imagine um real americans i should say not the mainstream media we are positively seized with what is going on up north and you were one of the people that early got involved and helped to organize this is that correct yes and so what you're seeing right now um is obviously trudeau has essentially declared himself dictator he's seized emergency powers to deal with what he once upon a time told us was a small fringe irrelevant protest um and they are doing things that i just i would have never thought would have happened in the modern western world particularly i want to talk about your um you work with tom tamara lick is that how you say her last name tamara leach and chris barber who are also organizers they have both been arrested what are the charges pending against them okay so in uh chris's case chris was um was charged with mischief aiding and abetting which has never existed as far as we know and he was actually released last week so he spent one night in jail and he was released uh and he was released with a gag order which is what we think they were they were looking for tamara was spent all weekend in jail it's a long weekend here it's of all things family day this weekend and the crown or our equivalent of prosecutor dr ran out the clock as long as she could in uh in the proceedings for a bail hearing for mischief a bail hearing and this morning she was denied bail she now potentially serves apparently up to 10 years in prison and we don't know if it's just a coincidence that the judge who's presiding over her case was a liberal party candidate in 2011. wow so that's the state of things in canada right now with a baby at home and another one on the way have to pay very close

they wouldn't give someone bail especially following the george floyd black lives matter protest which your government was incredibly supportive of which were actually violent protests in many regards i mean billions and billions of dollars in damage at least in america does that seem strange at all what are they gagging what don't they want him to say well let's not forget the fact that prime minister trudeau attended the black lives matter rallies and took a knee for george floyd but he couldn't out over the entire three weeks that we had essentially a block party around peace and love and barbecues and dancing and all that sort of i mean we thought trudeau loved to dance remember we got elected he was going all over the world dancing in different countries well he didn't come out in a costume and dance for us for whatever reason it just went straight from him initially hiding to then calling everybody names right racist whatever frog you name it that was the strategy and then the next step was go full martial law and violence against these demonstrators that's that's been the process it's been quite shocking yeah and we did see them attempt that which we see so much in america we attempted we saw the attempted smear and libeling of these protesters or nazis and i i thought it was actually quite funny when they said um they were waving a confederate flag i'm like why would canada be waving a flag for the american confederacy of our civil war made entirely no sense they found one guy who was probably planted there for those purposes and that narrative did fall short people were going no this looks really like a barbecue people seem like they're you know having fun spreading love um which is scary and then they sort of pivoted and said you know what actually this is a national economic crisis and now we have the right to treat these people um as we please are you fearful that you may be arrested i don't know i've uh left the ottawa area uh i've left downtown ottawa and the you know the blockade that now exists that the government has uh created uh but a couple of things just to go back the confederate flag thing not only did that person bring a confederate flag but he was shouted down by all the truckers and was told to leave he's not welcome here and it was funny he was wearing a black balaclava and the first thing that came to my mind is hey it's justin trudeau because he wants to wear black things on his face it's got to be here right yeah and then you know when they started the the anti-semitic you know nazi all that sort of stuff well i guess ben shapiro and i are now the list of jews who are neo-nazis because that's how it works so he calls us names i'm a jew tamara is a metis an indigenous metis so we're the white supremacist and the nazis but the guy who is who wears blackface and whose brothers made a career out of producing israel apartheid videos they're the virtuous ones but we're anti-semitic right that's

that got famous on Tick Tock for basically what we thought was making fun of women dressing up in a skirt and saying my first day as a woman and jumping around outside pretending to be scared of bugs and it should have been a Halloween costume basically leaning into a stereotype of what it means to be a woman but all of a sudden this person is being promoted everywhere and he's receiving an award at the Forbes Women's power Summit and you're going what's going on and I told you what is potentially going on and what people believe is going on is that Tick Tock is intentionally and artificially um putting up lifting up the accounts that are the most perverse because Tick Tock is Chinese owned and what better way to attack Society than to celebrate perversity America America has become a cultural diversity the West has become a cultural perversity what is more perverse than a mentally disordered young man pretending to be a woman and frogging through the woods saying I'm scared of bugs and so therefore I'm a woman and talking like this well if you don't believe in conspiracies you might believe in them when I tell you that this individual started a tick tock account was just given permission to interview President Joe Biden now what's strange about that President Joe Biden doesn't give interviews President Joe Biden has barely given any interviews he didn't even campaign really remember covid so you can't ever see me out in front of a crowd ever because I'm just afraid but I am trust me the most popular American president of all time I did truly get 88 million votes that really happened but you've never seen a single crowd of people around me that weren't booing just somewhere in America there are 88 million people who do love him so Dylan essentially vlogged his experience his entire day leading up to the moment where he sat down with President Biden so here is Dylan Mulvaney dressing up like a woman and taking you through every aspect of his day it's day 222 of being the girl in Washington United States you know that phrase I fear I may have girl boss too close to the Sun well that's how I feel today because I get to sit down with Joe Biden and now this news and I get to ask him a few questions surrounding trans issues in the United States and talk to him about my transness and I I really just want to represent my community the best that I can and you know what as silly as I am on here I'm ready to step up and show that trans people we're not going anywhere and that trans kids they deserve a fighting chance to be their true selves okay oh my God I'm running late let's go and y'all are obviously wondering what I'm gonna wear to meet the president the trans flag colors right Dylan you're gonna be great I love you let's go come on the front door looking for the president's dog Our Queen love you I love you we're about to go is there anything in my teeth leaving on cloud nine the president of the United States gave me a cookie he gave me a cookie in the Oval Office now here's the question do I eat it or do I save it it has a seal I please honestly tell me hello everyone I want to pet the dog I got a pet his dog I'm still in shock and don't be mad but I don't get to post any of the footage until after the interview airs on Sunday night but it's gonna be worth it because I can't wait for you to hear everything that we talked about I left with a lot of Hope and optimism not only for just trans people but many different topics and the fact that our president has watched days of girlhood it's kind of Epic and I'm not gonna lie I have been I've been having a rough go of it lately a lot of darkness and and today was what I needed to keep going um also if you live in the U.S and can legally vote this is going to be one of the most important elections of our lifetimes so please get out and vote next month there is so much darkness in this world I mean sometimes the bad actually outweighs the good but we have to get in the mud right now and we're going to clean up some messes that have needed cleaning for hundreds of years and we've got to protect each other and I have your back and I really hope you have mine and I love you God bless all America oh say can you okay love y'all now Biden who doesn't even know that he is President still believes that he is Vice President did sit down and speak on trans rights with Dylan Mulvaney Jill mavaney asked the president some very simple questions do you think that states should be stopping people from mutilating their children and here's what President Biden had to say about that to Dylan do you think States should have a right to ban gender affirming health care I don't think any state or anybody should have the right to do that as a moral question as a legal question I just think it's wrong so as a moral question and as a legal question President Joe Biden thinks that people should be allowed to mutilate their children that's what he believes right and I guess we're calling it gender reassignment surgery because it sounds fluffy and sometimes a porcelain urinal can really literally be art except it's not it's a porcelain urinal and what you are doing is you are mutilating your children's bodies and those children suffer for the rest of their lives the rest of their lives they wake up one day and they realize that this idea was planted in their head by a society a culture a poisonous culture that told them that this was so that up was down that they could wake up one day and just think it and therefore be it you want to be a butterfly you're a butterfly it may put you under the knife and put Wings on you because should your butterfly you want to be a mermaid you're a mermaid let me sew your legs together and tell you that it's just one long fin of course it is a delusion but it is now a delusion that is trickling down from the very top of our Society the president of the United States is saying it is wrong for states to stand up and ban these procedures right if he was if he was trying to play it in the middle maybe he'd say wait until you're 18. I think it's great I think it's all great and I believe in being trans but maybe wait until you're 18. he's saying no no no no no no do it when you're six a state should allow parents to make these decisions for their children when they're six years old knowing that they'll never be sexually reproductive ever again these individuals are speaking out all the time people that are saying they have deep regret because doctors allow them to go on with this lie I have interviewed these people I have spoken with them these people commit to a lifetime of big Pharma drugs because they're in pain it causes early osteoporosis among other things which Matt Walsh showed in his documentary what is a woman it it's just a terrible terrible thing that we have going on in our society and you have a bunch of people that are cowards and of course Biden supports this because he is the state and the point of the state is to grow the State and what better way to grow the state than to produce a bunch of Franken children right you're experimenting with them you are causing them to become dependents on the State Medicaid is what they need right I need to have the government be able to afford all of this medicine that I now need because I allowed somebody to experiment on my body not that you're allowed to him because your parents allowed this to happen or just an even deeper sin and a deeper crime and I believe that we are going to in the future see a lot a lot of lawsuits children against their own parents children against doctors they're already happening quietly but we're going to be hearing about them a lot more soon one alternative asset that you really need to check out is multi-million dollar art at Masterworks Masterworks buys paintings from legendary artists like Picasso and

held the rally to and child mutilation at the Tennessee State Capitol send a message to lawmakers everywhere that radical experimentation is not Medical Care and of course the libs were angry the protest was huge everyone people came out to really support this and then there was a smaller faction of individuals that just could not believe how dare you how do you not understand how important it is for us to mutilate children and here are some of those protesters who came out to confront Matt Walsh [Music] is [Music] you support anything he says you are indoctrinating everyone you know into being a Nazi sarcastic terrorists [Music] don't push things on people while there's a child so Matt Walsh is a Nazi that's the idea right I thought it was actually the Nazis that were into experimentation pretty sure Hitler had a lot of experiments uh that were taking place he experimented on twins he experimented on children so no you are not on the right side of this issue in fact I would never ever want somebody recording me supporting that radically supporting gender mutilation gender reassignment surgery by another name it is a stunning rebuke of our society that people don't recognize this as wrong you know it's it's incredible that people can become such ideologues that they are committed to this as if it's a cult and it's a religion right they they wake up every day and they say I have to get down to the state capitol and I need to stand up to this man who's essentially saying what Matt Walsh is saying is allow children to grow up right allow children to become adults or an adult if you want to let your own body it's not really my business right it really is my business but the idea that we should be seeding children with the notion that is a Lie by the way it is a lie to tell a child that they can pick their gender is a lie to make a man believe that if he gets breast implants he's suddenly a woman right despite this despite the fact that we know that it is a Lie from the top to the bottom of our society and our culture we are perpetuating the slide to the detriment of young children all right guys you know the next portion of the show is going to

sides and so the the we heard well belgium is doing masks or locking down or or quarantining well at it that's actually the responsible position if somebody is a close contact or is identified as

loss you lost a long time ago you know we're thinking about another election but i i'm never going to let this go at my funeral i want y'all to talk about hillary clinton should be in prison for what she did yeah with those servers i don't i do not understand how you have a server in your house you know i'm a former police officer there's no way that anybody else in the general public can send and receive classified information on a private server that the government didn't know about and don't go to jail so she can forget about her little master class i want to see her go to jail for what she's done i think we should watch yeah i think we should see more of it i think let's watch more of her didn't as you know write a concession speech because even though we had a lot of bumps those last 10 days uh i i still thought you know we could pull it out so i worked on um a speech that really was about my journey and hadn't had a real emphasis on my mother's life and journey i dream of going up to her and sitting down next to her taking her in my arms and saying look at me listen to me you will survive you will have a good family of your own and three children and as hard as it might be to imagine your daughter will grow up and become the president of the united states god i honestly think trump broke her like i actually think like trump legitimately broke hillary clinton like i don't i actually buy that she's not over it i actually buy that she reads that speech at least once a week yeah to her grandkids yeah and jackie has been reporting that she's calling around donors talking about whether or not she should run in 2024 so this could potentially be a lead up because suddenly she's like back in the press and she's kind of talking about you know the bat she's in the press talking about how trump is is dangerous i don't know how he's not even in the white house and we know that biden is not going to be their candidate obviously he's completely senile and they can't fake you know the coveted thing twice they can but they won't fake the covet thing twice in terms of not seeing their candidate are they potentially considering getting behind hillary clinton for a third time oh how could be smarter than that well i hope they do i just want her to disappear like the clinton global foundation disappeared yeah that's exactly right they did something you want her to go away they did tell me i don't know you know what i i think i like her she's grown on me you know she just she won't go away now she's a part of me and i want i would like to see her lose a third time you know what i mean and i'm totally for it um and it would be really interesting by the way i did happen to interview trump yesterday which is amazing um and i asked him about her and hillary clinton and potentially running away and this was that was actually off camera he said he'd love it he would absolutely love it if she ran again if he's um running so first i want to show you guys a brief clip of that amazing interview that we got to sit down which will be premiering next week trump like you've never seen him before take a look welcome to a most special episode of candace each time that i've interviewed president trump they have never told me that i am not allowed to ask him anything today i want to talk about some topics that are on i think everybody's mind [Music] where do you stand on these vaccine mayonnaise what's going on there you talk about mass you talk about mandates julian assange edward snowden i mean you could have had a chance to part in these individuals you have two sides of it anything that looking back you think i got that one wrong did you get covered uh no did you have the vaccine no no kitty i'm very impressed with you alec baldwin is he gonna get arrested i think he's crazy this is the toughest question i could possibly ask you tell me one good thing joe biden has done in office she's done this before right he is completely unscripted it's one of the things that fascinates me about him what you see is exactly what you get all right mr president conversation was amazing i don't think anyone's ever asking those questions i was really intent on not having it be an interview where i was fawning over trump because i was saying like too many people understand what trump are just like i love you when you're coming back and i'm left there just trying to like smear him and libel him and i wanted to ask him some really tough questions and then at the very end for funsies speaking of hillary i got him to sign this newsweek um madam president you remember they went to the press early and because they knew she was going to be president speaking of fake news and they printed these and so i got my hands on one and i got trump to sign it and he chose to sign it directly on her forehead i love him he's a savage i love him i think you should send that to her i know i should know i want to frame it i

with you would you get behind president trump would you get behind a president hillary would you get behind a dead joe biden um well definitely i would always love trump i mean things were great but ron desantis is a great option i love this answer i just want to know when the democrats who claim to be the party of diversity are going to stop running old white people yeah we tried kamala give them a break yeah i don't know trump always loved trump um but same if not trump someone like desantis maybe who's a little bit more refined that the media can't fool everyone with i mean maybe yeah that's true yeah i have to say desantis as well you know i really like trump but i think he served his purpose you know i look at trump as the battering ram on the swat team he rammed the door caused chaos and everybody else needs to come in smooth you know there's a couple of things that i didn't like that he promoted i don't like that he promote these vaccines it really bothered me i don't like the way he went out of of the oval office i felt like he kind of went out with his head you know with his tail tucked between his legs and so i i want to see a new candidate i want to see somebody that's a little more balanced that's not arguing with people and arguing with the media during the pandemic um things like that however if he runs in 2024 i'm voting for him so you know these are my suggestions but if the man runs i think he did a tremendous job as president when he was in office i really would like to see his policies move forward and i think that may be possible with somebody

Delilah for her boyfriend her boyfriend's name is Calum black she claims that she then developed feelings for the naughty doll and even participated in pretend threesomes with the squishy silicone toy now however she is going a step further and she's decided to go under the knife an attempt in an attempt to look more like Delilah Delilah the squishy silicone doll she says quote I think she's so pretty and I want to look exactly like her I've had multiple types of filler carried out to look more like her as well as a nose job so it should not surprise you that this woman also has an only fans account and she's being these pictures of her and her boyfriend uh in the news they're proud of themselves they actually consider themselves to be in a throttle", "9PpE1IXEVEg": "welcome back joining me now is a man who usually hides behind the camera for very good reason I have with me now the founder and CEO of project Veritas James O'Keefe hello not usually your gig you're usually a little more covert you got you're now sitting on a couch in front of a live studio audience a little bit of a switch up for you definitely this is really cool and exciting I love the energy here so I remember when I first met you I feel like we were both like just coming up maybe you were obviously a little before me but I remember I Met You in Palm Beach at the Horowitz Foundation Portage Center horwood Center and um hearing your story about what you were doing you started showing all these videos and all these operatives that you had uh you know entrenched at CNN you know people on Facebook kind of really trying to tell the story that these companies uh were really encroaching in totalitarian territory how did project Veritas get started what happened to you James good question uh I mean it's all transformed in the last few years now we have people on the inside that reach out to us like inside CNN the federal government but in the beginning I was in college and I was surrounded by political correctness and professors who were behaving badly and I decided to do something about it started a student newspaper one of the First videos we ever did was about Lucky Charms cereal because as an Irish person I was I said I was offended by The Lucky Charms and I went in there with a hidden camera this is about 15 years or 20 years ago and I said uh it offends my Heritage and they told me they would remove the cereal because it's racist against Irish people oh my gosh so it kind of became like Borat needs 60 minutes yeah so we've done I don't know hundreds of of Investigations and what's changed Candace is now people on the inside reach out to me I had to infiltrate these groups I had to go undercover and now just like last week a student inside the school uh took a photo of the antifa flag on the wall and told us about the the teacher and we corroborated it so it's become kind of a Grassroots movement of people on the inside that film what's going on actually let's actually start there because I think especially on this show I've been kind of unpacking uh for people the indoctrination that is happening in the school systems and I think it's so much worse and then parents are finally really starting to understand that we have a problem here uh you know when they're not even teaching your children mathematics or engineering and they're teaching them wokisms and you have these professors and teachers that are just activists and you did uncover uh this teacher and I want to show the clip from Project Veritas so let's roll the clip of the teacher uh Mr rantipa himself um and as soon complained about that and you said you made them feel uncomfortable it's meant to make Fashions feel uncomfortable so if you feel uncomfortable I I don't really notice it I have 180 days certain amount of revolutionaries how do you do that how do you study there's a reason why Generation Z these kids are are becoming further and further a lot I I probably uh as far left as you can go I've had like students show for like protests community events you know tabling food distribution also all sorts of things so like it's and I do it for extra credit so they get points to doing they have to convince people that this is what we actually need this is this is terrifying this is child abuse this is a predator in the classroom to say I have 180 days to turn them into revolutionaries say that I'm giving them extra credit to show up to protests um this is It's unimaginable to me that this person ever got hired um so first off I'd like to know now that it's in the post can you tell us how you got the tip about this teacher and the antifa flag in the classroom like where are the administrators why didn't they walk in and say this is unacceptable yeah they have the antifa flag of classroom the flag of Chairman Mao communist in the classroom and what's remarkable is that of course everyone knew this the principal knew it everyone who worked at the school knew it and they did nothing it wasn't until project Veritas showed up and photographed it videotaped it someone in the classroom was our informant and we get and every time I break one of these I got 100 more people become informants and a thousand people become informants so they did nothing and until we showed up and then they said they're gonna fire this guy so they admitted he did something wrong now the question he's not the only person that should be fired because if this if Mouse is waving high and as a flag and antifa as a flag in the classroom presumably the administrators are walking around other teachers are seeing it so why is he the person that gets fired that's why this is such a big deal because the the most of the time we are always on defense we're always complaining about the problems well now they're on defense and there's a school board meeting uh that happened the day after this tape came out and hundreds of parents showed up they were all indignant they were all upset they were all in the verge of tears I was on the verge of tears watching them and they were all upset that why didn't you guys do anything so to photograph the thing makes you do it but you saw it you did nothing so the system is completely broken there's a lot more people like this guy but I feel like there was a turning point moment last week to see all these hundreds of Outreach by the way the school board meeting occurred and they they snuck out of the board meeting the superintendent left wow and got into their Tesla cars and drove away wow it was truly an extraordinary moment but I do feel like we're at a turning point and I feel like what gives me hope is the fact that I am receiving these messages on the inside of all these organizations inflation is here and it is not going away our government does not have a search Gold group checked your savings against inflation by diversifying into gold and silver with Birch gold group if you haven't

obligation info kit and to speak with a precious metals expert on holding gold and silver in a tax sheltered account again text Candace to 484848 and protect your savings today we actually do have a clip from a school board meeting and they think project Veritas you know it's let's show that clip of them at the school board meeting because it is so important for parents to show up to these meetings today the video that we saw from Project Veritas is what brought us out tonight um as a parent in Sacramento I was just floored man had an antifa flag behind his debt yeah chairman now in them oh my God are you kidding me okay this has got to stop and all of you people out there your man ex-military ex-law enforcement current law enforcement I'm anx law enforcement you need to be on the front lines every year you guys should be held responsible honestly I'd be ashamed to go out and get coffee tomorrow morning and you really I mean when you think about the history of this country and what we used to do to folks that would do something such as child abuse to our children and Batman still enjoying life right now unfortunately you guys have a lot to do this means that in two weeks in 13 days he was allowed to change my daughter's mind about some fascist crap that y'all have led in this school thank you how long does it have to go on before somebody says something yeah yes how long how long what are you gonna do that's the question get him out of here we don't [\u00a0__\u00a0] care about this boy he got to go [Applause] I mean it must it must honestly feel incredible for you to see that you started this organization and you're you're I love the the slogan be brave do something people step up and you see what an impact it's had in this community because sadly parents didn't even know this was happening you assume as a parent you can drop your child off and they're going to be safe and it's actually right now in this Society quite the opposite they think I have six hours just like you said I have 180 days six hours a day to indoctrinate these children and turn them into radicals it is unacceptable that only he got fired every single person sitting there should be fired the entire Administration should be fired yes but and the fact that he was fired or they're saying they're going to fire him is such a big deal because it's tantamount to an admission they did something wrong and a lot of people on the left are heedless they're Shameless they stand behind Charlie Chester the technical director I think it's another clip you have coming up at some point during the show nothing happened to him he said we propagandize people we we try to hurt Trump uh he says that he effectively wanted more people to die to covet to get more ratings nothing happens so the fact that the teacher they said they were going to fire him it's one small step a lot of the comments I get are nothing ever happens to these people there's a cynicism in this country there's a hopelessness and I say you change one life you can change the entire world you make one small difference it can change things it's the beginning of something yeah that was that school board meeting was the most powerful thing I've ever seen and I've been doing this for a long time because what I saw was a people from all walks of life all political Persuasions pissed off and and they felt inspired and when people don't mess around when it comes to their kids too right and I think I've always said this is a winning issue I think for conservatives and I think this is the one issue of children in terms of protecting the children that it's not a left or right issue it's actually a uniting issue and I think that this is where the left really got it wrong when they started this radical approach uh to the youth even in terms of the masking I mean I'll go in there you see in the classroom you can go to a ball game you can have your mask off but you know what your children are going to be Mass this dehumanizing approach uh for children eight hours a day being behind a piece of cloth all of this stuff is something um that is actually uniting parents around realizing that the new Target now forget left or right it's your kids they want your kids radicalized and they will do anything to do that yes I think moral consensus is how I would put it as an investigative reporter I'm trying to find issues that can bring us together because if we can all be together on this because I want to F with your kids and scare the F out of them nobody unless you're mentally insane supports that right let's go expose more of that and this is in California right so we can assume that this is a you know this is a leftist state right they've got leftist administrators and yet you're seeing this response from parents saying enough is enough yeah it's a very hard to fire a teacher in in California and that's what's happening so we need to do more of this create righteous indignation around certain issues that bring us together thanks for joining me on this segment of Candace if you like this video subscribe to this YouTube channel and ring the bell to get

sadism we have to bring up our folks over at Media Matters you know they watch every minute of daily wire content that they can possibly find and then they take out whatever 10 second or 30 second clip that they can find out of context and they perpetuate it on the internet and a lot of times it happens to go trending something that can be rather innocuous but it happens to go trending I I asked the question what's the relationship Media Matters has with Twitter but who knows um I am once again forced to bring my friend Matt Walsh out of cancellation he's being canceled now every other week for various things that he is saying and they presume he is a radical and I believe it is a radical when it comes to Dasani water I'm not gonna lie he thinks it's good so there are a lot of lingering questions there but yesterday after I think about 72 hours of Canada someone's trending suddenly Matt Walsh began trending and I took a look at this trend and I realized it was about something that he said that we need to discuss about anime take a listen what's your opinion on anime it's really popular amongst teens and young adults I think it's all satanic I have no argument for it I have no argument for why it's satanic it just seems that way to me all anime to me seems weird just like bizarre creepy um and in general I don't think that adults should be whether it's anime or any other kind of cartoon uh with with rare exception adults really shouldn't be watching cartoons in general I would say oh listen I don't know why people were so upset about this um I want to be very clear here at the daily wire we own the science we own the science on anime in the same way the CDC owns the science we own the science um and unless you have something compelling to say or something that you can argue against what he's very clearly said is just that's what he thinks it's it it's over it's satanic this is this should be it's a conclusion now uh we don't want to hear it in fact we'll send to you if you have anything to say against what he said I stand by my friend and my colleague Matt Walsh and his assessment I'm not exactly sure why daily wire is receiving so much pressure about this but Matt Walsh did respond to the pressure uh he tweeted I'm catching some heat because I said that anime is satanic I just want to clarify that yes it will literally lead to demonic possession in upwards of 87 of cases studies show yeah studies show guys I mean that's it he has said that studies show we shouldn't look any deeper uh into whether or not that claim is true through he also went on to tell us even more science behind his claims he says the girl from The Exorcist used anime and then the next thing you know she was crawling around upside down on the ceiling you guys need to learn your history yes you guys do need to learn your history this is a fact it's like I said daily wire owns a science so it feels weird to me that there's been all this backlash I don't know why this is trending and then he also adds this just from a different daily wire study um if this one was actually conducted by me 74 of all serial killers have an anime habit Hitler was also into anime reports suggest um I mean I can't I cannot even possibly understand how that could be debunked we've already told you that multiple studies say this and we are the ones that are running the studies because we are the experts on anime and we know we're the experts in anime because no one else has come forth to say that they are the experts on anime so if you're having a different experience with anime it doesn't matter and that's um that's all I want to say about that moving on to people that are purportedly to be canceled rapper M.I.A remember I talked about her a couple of days ago we all know the all I want to do is when uh and take your Malay I think I sound really good so every time I bring her up I'm just gonna do that because it was a Smash Hit but M.I.A has been purportedly canceled at least by GQ because of her very sensible tweets so M.I.A tweeted this she said Alex Jones lying and Pfizer lying are both trending one with penalty other without if you have no critical thinking faculty this is about as crazy as we should get before a nuclear war wipes out the human race so we covered that she said that and what ended up happening is that GQ responded to these tweets by taking Mio she's supposed to I guess have a cover story or be featured in it and they wrote to her and told her that that could no longer happen the email that she received from GQ says hey Amanda sadly I have some bad news in regards to the GQ award in our upcoming photo shoot Mia's current Twitter activity was brought to our attention and due to its controversial nature GQ will have to step back from working with Mia in regards to our GQ men of the Year award sorry for these bad news on a Friday afternoon please let me know when you want to speak about it on the phone best Dom so casual sorry you are not telling the line which is probax everyone in Hollywood must be probax or you cannot participate in Hollywood we will cut you out of the ecosystem how dare you M.I.A say something uh that even if it's true obviously it's true Pfizer was trending because it turns out that they always knew that it wasn't going to make us immune we already covered that but now she is facing consequences as seems to always be the circumstance um if you dare if you ever dare to ordain to think for yourself the idea that she even spoke about critical thinking in her tweet means that she is not a good candidate to stand up in Hollywood right you're not supposed to think critically when you're in Hollywood you are told what to think and you or your job as somebody in Hollywood is to sell it to the masses so you know what I have reached out to Mia because I don't believe in cancel culture as I told you and I have asked her if she would sit down and talk to me a little bit about her ideas these crazy ideas that she's had about the vaccines which we now know are facts I would like to talk to her about her crazy idea to willingly speak out on those facts and I'm very interested in having that discussion with her so ladies and gentlemen women stay tuned alright guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Meghan Markle saying that she felt like she was quote treated like a bimbo during her time on Deal or No Deal man I love that I love that when women go back and make decisions and then just change their minds so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "Ww1hdo6VrCY": "but today I asked you the question if Adolf Hitler in a speech said two plus two equals four would he have been correct ladies and gentlemen the answer of course is no he would have been wrong because he's Hitler what's wrong with you how dare you say that anything he said could have possibly been right what are you anti-semitic do you want Jewish people to die that kind of sort of embodies the sorts of discussions we have today where there's absolutely no Nuance once we decide that an individual is a bad person then everything that they've ever said or that they will say is shouldn't even be examined it's of course wrong it's of course backwards this person is bad or good this person is an evil person or a loving person everything in our society is black and white in fact I call this almost BLM syndrome it sort of reminds me of when black lives matter exploded onto the scene or even the 2020 protests of George Floyd God forbid any individual leaned in and said hey but wait a minute I don't know about this organization black lives matter if you said that at the time which of course as you guys know I did suddenly you would become Public Enemy Number One because how dare you exercise any Nuance of course black lives matter is good and if you disagree with black lives mattering then it's because you're a racist right you're just a bad person how dare you even ask a question so what we don't know where all the money is going and it appears to be into a black hole so I was thinking about that because I am so routinely frustrated by our inability to have any Nuance I'm so frustrated that every time I try to explore a comment or an organization when it's trending and it's trendy to love that organization or to love that individual I am always hitting the media right for example when this the out at the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine I said what was totally fine to say a couple of years ago zielinski is a bad faith actor if you were reading the New York Times or the Washington Post a couple of years ago they were honest about his bizarre ties to billionaires and some shady dealings in the region obviously people would say that Ukraine was a laundromat and people in the west would go there to clean their money that was all fine years ago but now all of a sudden he's been promoted to to I don't know the cover of Vogue cover of Vanity Fair Forbes is doing a piece on him he's dressed well he's got a stylist and now we're only supposed to say good things about President zelenski and we're only supposed to say bad things about Vladimir Putin that's just where we are today and I had gotten hit by the media because I had the audacity not even gonna believe what I did it's really bad I had the audacity to read one of Putin's speeches in its entirety and to comment on it I know it's crazy why on Earth would we do that we have the media who are supposed to read the speeches for us interpret it for us and tell us what to think we're not supposed to think for ourselves or to think critically or to think with a little bit of nuance you're not going to believe this though guys it's it's Monday and I'm fired up and I'm gonna do it again I did it again I read one of his speeches in its entirety Vladimir Putin's and he said something over the last couple of days um he actually said several things that I wanted to bring to your attention now again because I have to say it obviously I am not supporting Vladimir Putin in the same way that I am not supporting president zielinski I think there was a lot going on in that region that few of us will even understand and it is important that we talk about it because it may impact in fact it is it is impacting us now right there now if you're following uh what's going on you have Putin who is outright accusing America of attacking the pipeline of attacking Nordstrom of basically trying to inspire an energy crisis throughout Europe because it would benefit us now I can't say whether that's true or false obviously I wouldn't possibly know that but what I can say is that some other notes that he hit in his speech are interesting and I want to see what you think about it so essentially the speech that he gave is him saying um and I'm summarizing here that uh the American way the Western Way has always been one of plundering of inspiring Wars because we were facing an economic crisis or an energy crisis and he's accusing us of doing the same here he starts talking about this inflated capitalization of America basically saying that we don't have any true wealth really we inflate the cost of social media companies but that's not actually true wealth because it doesn't help us feed our families so I'm going to directly quote him you can't feed them with those pieces of paper and the virtual inflated capitalization of Western social media companies can't Heat their homes everything I'm saying is important and what I just said is no less so you can't feed anyone with paper you need food and you can't heat anyone's home with these inflated capitalizations you need energy that is why politicians in Europe have to convince their fellow citizens to eat less take a shower less often and dress warmer at home and those who start asking fair questions like why is that in fact are immediately declared enemies extremists and radicals they point back at Russia and say that is the source of all of your troubles now the reason why I found I'm going to stop right there the reason why I found that part to be interesting is because we saw that in real time in America so it doesn't really matter what you think about Ukraine or Russia or Vladimir Putin or zolensky but we watched in real time how before there was ever any conflict in that region before anybody had declared war in that region our gas prices were going up we saw this it was happening and we're going to the pump we were saying why are these gas prices going up we were told that the inflation was transitory that was only going to be for a little bit first you told it wasn't happening then we were told that it was transitory and then suddenly this conflict breaks out in the region and we were told oh the reason why this is happening the reason why the gas prices are so high is because of Vladimir Putin and that of course didn't make any sense because it wasn't what we were told before that conflict ever broke out so it made me ask the question why are we why are we suddenly saying that but I want to go on he says here I want to make special notes of the fact that there is every reason to believe that the Western Elites are not going to look for constructive ways out of the global food and energy crisis that they and they alone are to blame for as a result of their long-term policy dating back long before our as refers to it special military operation in Ukraine I am afraid they would rather use other formulas they are more comfortable with and here it is important to recall that the West built itself out of its early 20th century challenges with World War One profits from World War II helped the United States finally overcome the Great Depression and become the largest economy in the world and to impose on the planet the power of the dollar as a global Reserve currency and the 1980s crisis things came to a head in the 1980s again the West emerged from it unscathed largely by appropriating The Inheritance and resources of the collapsed and defunct Soviet Union that's a fact now by the way he's saying that that's a fact I learned that from uh I learned that from a western book called the world for sale after the collapse of the Soviet Union a lot of our Traders went in obviously things were insane in those territories and they began moving oil out of the region so there is some Merit to that now if that's entirely what happened I couldn't say but like I said you could read the book it's called the world for sale and it talks about what happened with the collapse of the stone of the Soviet Union but here's where it gets especially interesting and where I want I want you to think about and I want you to write into the show and tell me what you think about it he goes on to talk about what he describes as this neo-colonial model right uh which is as he describes It ultimately doomed he says this but I repeat that it's real Masters will cling to it to the end they simply have nothing to offer the world except to maintain the same system of plundering and racketeering they do not give a damn about the natural right of billions of people the majority of humanity to freedom and Justice the right to determine their own future they have already moved on to the radical denial of moral religious and family values let's answer some very simple questions for ourselves he continues now I would like to return to what I said and I want to address also all citizens of the country not just the colleagues that are in the hall but all citizens of Russia do we want to have here in our country in Russia parents number one parents number two and parent number three instead of a mother and a father do we want our schools to impose on our children from their earliest days in school perversions that lead to degradation and Extinction do we want to drum into their heads the ideas that certain other genders exist along with women and men to offer them gender reassignment surgery is that what we want for our country and our children this is all unacceptable to us we have a different future of Our Own let me repeat that the dictatorship of the western Elites targets all societies including the citizens of Western countries themselves this is a challenge to all this complete renunciation of what it means to be human the overthrow of faith and Traditional Values and the suppression of Freedom are coming to resemble a religion in Reverse pure satanism that is interesting I'm going to stop there and ask you what you think about that because while I can't speak to the rest of a speech and obviously there's propaganda in this there's propaganda in our media there's propaganda in the west there's propaganda in the East what I can say is that this is an interesting question do we even want to have this sort of a society what does it mean when you have a leader like Putin attempting to Galvanize the people in this country by speaking to what are in fact evils in our country right the the idea that a leader is now using those evils to try to inspire people to get behind him right to to sort of declare war on Western ideology is problematic and we should talk about that because if we don't have the willingness to talk about that and we allow and we pretend it's normal right if we just say oh well well it doesn't matter these are the rantings of a Madman does it matter that what he's saying is yes we are saying that children should be off offer gender reassignment surgery yes we are starting children on puberty blockers what we are doing is so evil that is allowing a bad person to point the finger at us and say are you with me are you with them and it is true that the people in our country who are speaking out against these Evils are being turned on by the media right when somebody stands up in our country and says no it's not okay to trans the kids no it's not okay to fundamentally alter the bodies of children we are referred to as transphobic right we are shut down our speech is shut down we are smeared um as as hateful bigots who just don't understand and then we're supposed to allow them to fly a banner that says Love Is Love No Love Is Love is not telling a child that they should alter their perfect little bodies um for an idea that will never manifest you cannot just think your way into a different gender again the reason why I want to point this out is because we are losing the moral High Ground in this country America is losing the moral High Ground right if this was a few decades ago and you heard Putin give a speech and say these sorts of things you would we would say we are a country with good values we are a country that believes in God we are a country that defends our children we are a country that teaches our children things of substance in the classrooms all of that has radically changed our value system at least the ones that they are trying that is coming from the top right the Department of Education attempting to cheat teach CRT critical race Theory attention attempting to teach children to judge one another based on the color of their skin you're either white and privileged or you're either black and you're oppressed this is not a society with good morals and if we don't have good morals right we cannot stand up in the world and say that we want to spread democracy that we want to spread our ideas the if the ideas are poisonous in America of course the ideas are going to be considered poisonous overseas we have to have the courage to talk about that because pretending that it's not happening and just saying Putin bad is not going to be a solution it's not going to be a long-term solution again I encourage you guys to read the speech in its entirety there are things that I fundamentally disagree with all throughout it but that part about saying that we are beginning to put forth a religion in Reverse which is pure Satanism as a Christian as a Christian that believes that Satan is the author of lies and deceptions I see that it is a satanic thing for us to tell children that they can pick their gender and I will continue to say that irrespective of whether or not that lands me wrongly assumed at least in the Press uh lands me as somebody who's going to be smeared as a Putin puppet as they like to say all of this to say obviously that our world is not just black and white it's important to continue to educate ourselves and to ask ourselves questions that make us uncomfortable all right ladies and gentlemen that is all I have to say about that as you know the remainder portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I will be giving you guys my thoughts on infant circumcision since somebody had a question about that so if you're not yet a member go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "fMikwCP-W7g": "all right guys Friday Vibes do you know who's a Friday Vibe rapper M.I.A yeah she's a rapper entertainer from the UK she's also Sri Lankan used to be a leftist I'm pretty sure but not according to these tweets and so my question of the day is did you see Mia's tweets plus a 21 year old Tick-Tock star who has nearly 8 million followers has gone viral because she accidentally bought a 100 000 couch in an online auction yep she also says the idea of getting a job to pay for it makes her want to throw up all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] foreign [Music] rapper M.I.A that's what she's known as maybe you know that popular song from a while ago All I Wanna Do Is and take your money you know okay maybe I'm not doing a very good job doesn't matter it's not relevant to the story I'm pretty sure she used to be on the left and yesterday she sent out some Tweets in support of Alex Jones so let me give you the background before we actually get to her tweets so Alex Jones you'll remember he has been facing a couple of defamation lawsuits because he spread theories about the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary that essentially said that none of the 20 children and the six adults that were killed had actually died and that their relatives were crisis actors well now he has been ordered to pay 965 million dollars okay so almost a billion dollars to the families of those that were killed the verdict which was returned on Wednesday by a jury in Connecticut in the defamation trial joins the 49 million dollars that was already awarded by a Texas jury earlier in the year to another Sandy Hook family who had brought a separate case against Jones and there's also a third case that is tentatively set for later this year now let me just say this um in no way do I condone the conspiracy theories that were surrounded around Sandy Hook I do know that as a Connecticut resident I I was a cranky resident at that time I remember that a lot of the families had a lot of questions that were not being answered regarding the Sandy Hook shooting I think Alex Jones voiced some of those questions and then went a little far obviously and said that nobody died at everything uh was potentially just crisis actors and that is what landed him in these suits the verdict what do you think about that well you might think well how of course the family is upset they lied people started believing in these conspiracy theories and they were harassed because the fam that because people believed that they were all crisis actors and that's a horrible thing to go through imagine losing your child and then having to suffer a bunch of people that believe that your child isn't even dead of course you can understand that but what's interesting here is when we decide that conspiracy theories in the media are harmful and when we decide that they are not and that is what rapper M.I.A is giving a voice to she tweeted Alex Jones lying and Pfizer lying both trending one with penalty other without if you have no critical thinking faculty this is about as crazy as we should get before a nuclear war Wipeout wipes out she meant to say the human race she then tweeted if Alex Jones pays for lying shouldn't every celebrity pushing vaccines pay too oh wow yeah that is a lot of critical thinking and it's definitely going to land her into some trouble but she makes a point we have become increasingly hypocritical I mean if Alex Jones pushed a harmful conspiracy theory I it was harmful because it led to the harassment of others what about the entire covid conspiracy theory the idea that masks worked which has now been debugged oh it's just okay you have to wear masks the idea which we showed yesterday that taking the vaccine was going to make you immune to covid are we forgetting that every news anchor they were running the death ticker making everybody fearful telling you that if you could kill the people that you love unless unless you get this vaccine and then of course they turn to Hollywood and they tried to make it cool to get this vaccine yeah well some senior executive advisor testified no we actually when we rolled out that back we had no idea whether or not it was going to work that was essentially which testified we had no idea whether or not it was going to make you immune to covid but we rolled them out anyways absent the tests that should have been required before the media was allowed to spread that conspiracy theory the conspiracy with the being that if you received this vaccine you were going to be better protected against covid-19 and the people that were not that was a lie that was a conspiracy theory and it led to a lot of harm in fact it led to people that lost their jobs people that were more completely mocked online me being one of them how stupid could you be to not get this vaccine I'm paraphrasing here but that came down from Megan McCain remember that whole debacle how dare you're just stupid and foolish at this point if you didn't get the vaccine right it was mockery it was peer pressure celebrity peer pressure for everyone to roll up their sleeves and to Simply inject something into their body something that we now know caused a lot of issues for women and their menstruation should those women who had those issues with their menstruation be able to sue the celebrities to be able to sue CNN to be able to sue Rachel Maddow to be able to sue Pfizer for lying safe and effective they said define safe and effective clearly it's not effective unless we have some new definition of what effective means an effective vaccine would render you immune to the disease that is purported to protect you from so why is Alex Jones being forced to pay a billion dollars okay essentially a billion dollars when you add up so far and yet all of these celebrities and the entire mainstream media that forced you to do something against your will through a concerted fear campaign in a peer pressure campaign not being sued at all not even being mocked not even being called out they're just moving on nobody cares right it's not the only circumstance which has happened in which we keep seeing this astounding hypocrisy in our society right another story in case you're not paying attention to it is that Saudi Arabia has come out and flatly and plainly accused the Biden Administration accused Joe Biden himself of essentially asking for a quid pro quo essentially trying to interfere with the midterm elections by saying we just need you to be to keep pumping oil please OPEC just keep pumping oil right until the midterms because we don't want the gas prices to Skyrocket and people to maybe vote and think actually this Administration is causing me harming my own household so yes households pardon so yes the Daily Mail mail ran a headline that the Saudi Arabian government gave a bombshell statement stating that the Biden Administration reached out and pleaded with them to delay the OPEC deal to cut oil production until after the midterms now why is this accusation problematic why is it hypocritical oh wait I know ask me uh wasn't it just a short while ago when then president Donald Trump was in office that the Democrats sought and successfully impeached him for this very same accusation and theirs was completely unfounded everybody remembers the perfect phone call it was a perfect phone call Trump says a perfect phone call I spoke to president zelenski in Ukraine and yet the Democrats came out and they accused him of asking for a quid pro quo the quid pro quo at that time that they accuse him of of executing was saying to Ukraine we're going to withhold military funding unless you do my dirty work the Dirty Work that they say he asked for was for them to look into and to investigate Hunter Biden and that he was not going to okay Ukraine getting military aid unless this investigation was done the only problem with this claim against Trump is that when you read the transcript which of course they released later there is no such thing happened he never once said I'm going to withhold military aid to Ukraine that is what that is at the Crux of this debate right he had to have actually said you can only get this Aid if you do this here's what president Trump said directly from the transcript he said I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it now quick pause to give you to to bring you back to the memory of what we're talking about at this time Trump had just survived the never-ending Robert Mueller investigation the claims were that he was colluding with Russia it was in fact a cloud over this country people demanding that he did collude because oh I know the conspiracy theorists over at MSNBC Rachel Maddow the conspiracy theorist over at CNN Jake Tapper and Don Lemon kept pounding this narrative for years forcing the American people apart people that were firmly in the camp of yes they did collude with Russia that's how Trump run they needed that to be true because they couldn't believe that the American people just elected him fair and square they needed to believe that Russia had somehow gotten involved in our elections and made this happen and so they let this Cloud for two years ignore the American people they had people arguing with their family members over this you're either team Trump and believe this or you understand that Russian conclusion is real and then one day Robert Mueller said actually no uh he didn't include with Russia it's cool it's he didn't do that so Trump is speaking after his name has been cleared right and people are starting to realize that this entire narrative entire narrative that he colluded with Russia actually came out of Hillary Clinton's Camp right they planted these lies and they allowed this Cloud to exist as a part of a political strategy so he's talking to president zelenski and I'll continue so he says I would like you to do a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine they say crowdstrike I guess you have one of your wealthy people the server they say Ukraine has it there are a lot of things that went on the whole situation I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it as you saw yesterday that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller an incompetent performance but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine whatever you can do it's very important that you do it if that's possible Trump then went on to ask the other thing there's a lot of talk about Biden's son that Biden stops the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it it sounds horrible to me this is true obviously because bio notoriously said on stage that while he was the vice president he went into Ukraine and he stopped the prosecution of somebody because he was upset with the personal treatment of his son so yes Trump did ask them to look into the servers that were behind all of these lies that he included with Russia he asked them to explore what exactly is going on with President well he wasn't the president then but then uh Vice President Joe Biden who is saying that he had some influence in the region these are all valid questions and concerns if you're sitting president United States you would want to get to the bottom of these concerns that we're seeing in the media you're having a conversation with the person that can get to the bottom of these concerns that being president zelensky never once in this entire phone calls did he say and if you don't and if you don't we're not going to provide you any more military aid that was a lie that was made up it was so made up it was reinforced by the conspiracy theorists that demanded that just as we had gotten over the faux Russian investigation that we now needed Trump to be impeached for what he says amounted to a perfect phone call what the transcript shows is not a problematic phone call whatsoever and so when we see these things taking place and we see that Alex Jones is being asked to pay a billion dollars for spending a conspiracy theory the question we should ask ourselves is why not whether or not you agree with what Alex Jones said right what not whether or not you agree with the conspiracy theory right the question is why is only he being made to pay for it the answer is because we know that right now what we were existing under is something like a regime and it's not a stretch to say this is the Biden regime they are using the full power of the Department of Justice to go after their foes their foes of course are President Trump their foes are all of his supporters right the January 6th protesters those people need to be locked up but BLM can burn the place down how hypocritical is that we need to start funds to get people that are looting and rioting in the name of black lives matter out of prison but we need to make sure that we show people that the people that trespassed into the capital uh no those people are the true domestic terrorists it is ongoing hypocrisy that is continuing to happen in this country and in my opinion it is reaching a fever pitch people are are becoming more audacious and speaking out M.I.A has audaciously spoken out and said this is not right either Rachel Maddow should be forced to play a billion dollars Don Lemon the entire gang at CNN and MSNBC or nobody should be forced to pay a billion dollars for defamation and that's all I have to say about that all right so you guys know that inflation is a huge problem right now here are some numbers for you rent is up 29 nationally on average gas is upwards of five dollars a gallon and now the federal government is handing out ten thousand dollar checks to debtors that being said there are some Smart Financial moves that you can make to protect yourself like investing in alternative assets one alternative asset that you really need to check out is multi-million dollar art at Masterworks Masterworks buys paintings from legendary artists like Picasso and Banksy and breaks them into shares so you can invest for a fraction of the cost then when a painting sells again you get your potential return on that investment so far they've sold six paintings for an average net return of 29 these returns have remained consistent through covid inflation recession and everything else that has destroyed our investment portfolios over the last couple of years there was a big wait list to join but you can skip it by using my special code to join simply go to masterworks.com and use promo code can this that's masterworks.com promo code Candace see important regulation A disclosures at masterworks.com CD again that's masterworks.com promo code Candace okay now it's time for some topics to show [Music] so there is a 21 year old Tick Tock star she's got nearly 8 million followers and she is right now pleeing for donations now you might be thinking well what happened to this 21 year old girl maybe there was a horrible accident maybe she's lost her family maybe her house got struck by Hurricane Ian and she's got nowhere to live should we donate Candace um I wish I could tell you that any of those things were true but they're not what she did do was that she accidentally bought a 100 000 couch in an online auction and the idea of having to get a job to pay for it makes her want to throw up and now if this sounds like a joke I wish it was listen to her in her own words I just put an offer on the couch and I was joking I was joking about putting my card information [Music] out it almost crashed my car when I saw it because I don't I don't have oh my God I was joking I was joking if you're if you have a million dollars can you please donate can you please donate please if you have a billion dollars can you let me borrow some please so I am asking my listeners some of you who may have a million dollars can you please just donate please donate do you hear her pain she was just like you know on line and she would just plugging in some money that she doesn't have kind of like I do on Zillow not gonna lie sometimes I pretend to be a billionaire or go on Zillow I pick obscure districts and I just type in you know uh let's say I had 20 million dollars in the bank what could I get and I just check out the crib well this she went a little step further she wasn't just playing Zillow she decided to place a real bed on a real couch and she won the bid and now it would be the right thing for you guys to help her pay for it um I part of me obviously it's a very funny video it's hilarious to me it is truly a sign of the time just actually a little piece of me that does feel bad for her um it's being noted that she's friends with a lot of celebrities I think she's friends with Lil Nas X and she goes to all these events and I think that she suffered and had a little bit of a psychological break from reality which a lot of these kids are having because they want attention and they are pretending that they themselves lead these luxurious lives that they're seeing on Tick Tock and on Instagram and they're thinking I want to be a Kardashian and so she saw this hundred thousand dollar couch and she just thought you know what I'm gonna put my credit card information in and see what happens you know she was flying high and now reality has caught up with her as it tends to do it's why we are having this generation that is suffering from so much depression it is because there is such a stark distance between the their online avatars which we talk about all the time on the show I've created this online avatar and this online avatar has millions of dollars in the bank and could just drop a hundred thousand dollars on a couch reality she kind of goes on in other videos she's got some debts she cannot afford this at all and she's going to now have to make a public plea she says in the second video that I'm not playing for you because it's a bit inaudible um that she now is going to have to start an only fans account to pay for this because if she doesn't get this money if people don't give her the money she's now going to have to basically sell her body on only fans to be able to pay for this couch now whether or not that's true I don't know I think that actually realistically if you tried to buy a hundred thousand dollar couch on first dibs which is a website that you know could potentially have a 100 000 couch uh they would probably then give it to the second bidder because they realize that you have no money and they may charge you a fee this is the world that we are living in a world of extraordinary privilege and a desire to be more privileged than you actually are so good luck to you I personally will not be donating sweet girl but I am imploring my listeners to give her all of their money especially if you got a million dollars specifically she keeps saying if you have a million dollars can you please give her the money so she just wants you to give her casually 10 of what you have in the bank account moving on to another exceptional story uh there are some activists that have decided to throw tomato soup on Van Gogh's sunflowers at the National Gallery in London they've also glued themselves to the wall yeah I'm talking about van Gogh the one who cut his ear off the one who committed suicide this tortured artist he was an impressionist painter a Dutch impressionist painter and he lived in the mid 19th century he lived from 1853 to 1890. I don't know what he possibly did to deserve an activist from 2022 throwing tomato soup on one of his paintings I can't imagine why she did this why they did this I guess we should listen to them in their own words let's listen to the audio uh they just threw tomato soup on this real Van Gogh now they're sitting down in front of it and they're kneeling down in protest and they're about to explain why they did this for whatever reason they're painting their hands white with chalk art for life worth more worth more than Justice are you more concerned about the protection of a painting or the protection of our planet and people cost of living crisis is part of the cost of oil crisis fuel is unaffordable to millions of cold hungry families they can't even afford to heat a tin of soup okay I I I have a lot of questions about the logic here I mean Van Gogh mid 19th century I don't know if fossil fuels were really his problem not really sure why he had to get the can of tomato soup by the way if you're concerned about the cost of living crisis you might want to be concerned about your own cost of living crisis which I can promise you is about to get a lot worse given the fact that you just defiled a van Gogh painting I mean girl this was this was really really really stupid and by the way if you're concerned about people starving maybe don't throw food at a painting I don't know maybe the most effective thing would have been to give the can of soup to somebody that was starving clearly you don't very care you don't care very much about people starving it's just this is what they do they just want to defile and to destroy it's not about logic this didn't make a splash this isn't going to make people that are walking through this Museum go you know what I'm so glad that you did that I'm so glad that you just ruined art it's now making me really realize that I should go pick up a um what can of soup what are you trying what are you actually trying to get them to do these people are radical and they don't realize that it's typically their radical stances that are furthering the causes I mean you purport to care about the cost of living right but I will assume that you don't realize this is being impacted by your anger against fossil fuels your anger against the it's the environmentalists that are causing all these issues right don't drill don't drill we love the planet don't know we know we cannot have we cannot use nuclear energy no nuclear power plants bad bad bad and so then what happens is that you suddenly have an energy dependent Nation and when your energy dependent Nation goes to war with Russia and they're receiving oil via Russian pipelines well now you got to pay for it that people have to pay for it but you can't connect the dots in your own brain so what you do is you walk into a supermarket and you pick up some tomato soup and you throw it at Van Gogh I mean honestly it's just it's just I just feel so bad for Van Gogh this is just going to end very badly for these two individuals but I guess the young people can't stop being senseless and stupid and cannot stop purporting to be activists about causes that they understand nothing about speaking of knowing nothing about causes and activism reporters today wow they just love to bait race right they're just like um I see a black man so I'm going to try to get him to comment about being black and how hard it is that's just this is what I do I just you're black so obviously you must be oppressed I'm not racist I'm just saying obviously you're black and you must be oppressed so I'm just going to assign racism to you because of the color of your skin but that doesn't make me a racist per se even though I'm clearly judging you according to your skin color so the Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach his name is Todd Bowles he is my favorite person of the week happy Friday Todd Bowles I love you he offered an extremely refreshing remark on race at a recent press conference when he was being goaded by these reporters take a listen Mike Tomlin are two of the few blackhead coaches in the league I wonder what your relationship is like with them and your thoughts on Steve Wilkes joining NFL I have a very good relationship with Tomlin we don't look at what color we are when we Coast against each other we just know each other I have a lot of very good white friends that coach in this league as well and I don't think it's a big deal as far as us being coaching against each other I think it's normal Wilkes got an opportunity to do a good job hopefully he does it and we coach ball we don't look at color well when you say you see you guys and look like them and grow up like them means that we're eyeballs to begin with and I think the minute you guys start stop making a big deal about it everybody else will as well Todd Bulls you have won the week actually am more astonished by the second reporter doubling down she's like okay but you do understand that you should care that you're black like this is a match up between two black coaches and representation matters like she's not happy with the fact that he just said we don't look at each other as two black men we're just coaches in the league would you ever ask a white Coach that had a match up against another white Coach oh you know uh so uh you're both white uh how does that make you you would never ask that question she doesn't even realize that she is being racist by saying well you do understand which is a patronizing way of saying um I don't think you understood my colleagues questions let me rephrase it for you clearly you understand that you're black right clearly you understand that representation needs to matter and that you then need to make race an issue you need to answer this question in a way that allows people to know that race is a huge issue in the NFL and you're going to cow Tao to feeling like less than so that I can feel good about myself right that's the entire really what bursting was about it's a bunch of white people acting like saviors which is what this reporter the second one in particular did both of them did but she was even worse right she doubles down on the stupidity and what she's really after was make herself feel good oh my God I'm so brave I got into that press room and I uh I asked the black I gave him a platform I gave the black man a platform to talk about his blackness and that makes me a really good person that's what she was looking for and he rightfully smacked her down and said if you could stop just seeing me as a black man that maybe racism your view of racism everywhere would stop existing right many people before him have said this exact same thing in fact Morgan Freeman famously said that if you want to end racism stop talking about it stop looking at people and making judgments based on the color of their skin right Sasha and Malia Obama are not oppressed because they're black they lead a life of remarkable privilege they've probably never touched their own door handles actually the fact that they're black doesn't change that they're not suffering through oppression even though people want you to think they are right simply because you're white does not mean that you can't be born piss poor and without similar advantages right you could have be a less advantaged person because of the circumstances that you were born into and you're white when weighed against the circumstances that the Obama sisters were born into even though they're black but people don't understand this they don't understand this and they do not want to let go of this race narrative because it lines the pockets of a lot of people namely black lives matter the organization which my documentary has exposed they're they're dead now they're gone black lives matter is not a thing anymore I made sure that people understood what exactly was going on while our entire country was being torn apart by these racial narratives perpetuated by these reporters and their obsession with race everywhere well now my documentary the greatest lie ever sold has shown you where those dollars went where the 80 million dollars that they raised in under one year where it actually went and so I want to respond to some of you guys that have been tweeting at us and sending messages about the documentary it's been amazing to see the response and this is just the beginning so let's cover some of those responses this person at pro-life for all wrote the autopsy showed no injury to his neck holy beep why did I not know this right isn't that shocking how much information was kept intentionally from the public sphere they didn't want you to know the details of the case because they were so happy about this narrative the whole idea that he was on his neck and that he choked to death complete and utter crap and they knew it was crap next comment comes from at chickpea SP wrote please understand the message and the organization are not synonymous that drives me crazy actually last night um I was doing an event and I talked about the tremendous difficulty that people have with just admitting they were wrong it takes a lot of courage to admit that you were wrong and the reason for that is because sometimes you go so far you're so far in your wrongness that you don't just want to completely scale back and say yikes I'm kind of really wrong here right this is sort of like the people that were deleting friends you didn't post a black Square I'm deleting you you're obviously a racist you voted for Donald Trump I'm deleting you people were commenting people that they've known their entire lives and accusing them of racism during the BLM summer of riots and protests right if they didn't kowtow to this Narrative of George Floyd so imagine you're one of those people and you put that pressure and you deleted your friends that you grew up with off of Facebook and Instagram and you made sweeping statements you created a status on Facebook that said if you don't support BLM die right imagine you did all those things now you see my documentary you're like oh yikes um maybe I went a little too far it takes courage to refrend those people to admit that you were wrong and to correct course cowardice though is just backing up a little saying oh well you know the the uh movement was different than the organization that is foolishness of course it was not different from the organization it was the free marketing firm for the organization people were donating because they were told that it was a way to rinse themselves of this horrific crime that happened to George Floyd that oh I'm not a racist I donated to Black lives matter because people were wearing BLM shirts and you were meant to put a BLM flag up right there is nothing that is different between this do not allow people to lean into the cowardice of Simply refusing to admit that they were wrong another message came from at my sunshine hn they wrote where is the money as a black woman I am ashamed of this organization they live by the misfortunes of others and this is a business for them that is correct and you should be outraged especially as a black person because it was black pain that was used for this narrative right they were willing to hide behind black people black people were their Shields that people wouldn't look at what they were doing behind the scenes next up is from at rmfire64 he writes wow just wow Candace I never liked Tegan that's Chrissy Teigen but she and Jen Atkin and Dana Omari have shown themselves to be really bad people I was going to listen to this while painting but I can't take my eyes off the screen yeah it's pretty amazing if you watch documentary you will see that for whatever reason Chrissy Teigen just can't help it if there's a way to bully and to make someone feel bad and to try to drive someone to Suicide which she has done in other scenarios it seems that she likes to jump at the opportunity she's first in line and there are a lot of people that she could have bullied and no one would have paid attention to because she was hiding behind a black Square figuratively speaking well I paid some attention to it and I'm glad that you were equally as disgusted by what she did and what genatican did and what Dana Omari did next is from at baby blue TTU he wrote I thought this doc was great I also loved how Canada's personally helped Floyd's roommates that was the best part for me the interview with them speaking on that that was the most surprising part of the Journey of this documentary uh what you guys don't get to see is that we I particularly was terrified going into their house the team was on high alert we didn't know they didn't know that I was going to be interviewing them throughout much of this documentary particularly when we were in the autonomous zones I was wearing a bulletproof vest so the team was on edge we didn't really know what to expect they could have screamed at me they could have tried to hurt me or hit me and I was so so wrong so proven wrong they were so kind-hearted I I felt I remember walking out of the house and thinking well those two individuals felt like they were my aunt and uncle like they felt like a family member to me and it allowed me to actually tell the story not from the place of somebody who is enraged at how this country was torn apart but as somebody who was actually feeling sympathetic that some people really lost a friend someone that they loved George Floyd was somebody that they loved irrespect irrespective of his flaws his tremendous flaws and I think that that is actually what made the documentary greater next from Mike Wayne I'm an African living in Zimbabwe and I fully support where you are doing Candace Black Americans need to wake up they don't know how good they have it here we survive on a dollar a day and two meals if you're lucky teachers have been on strike for five years or more keep teaching them and I hope one day they will wake up yes it is true black Americans do not realize how privileged they are to live in this country and it's hard for them to recognize it when the media keeps telling them the exact opposite that you are not privileged at all and that your circumstances that you live in are not your own doing but the doing of some white supremacist narrative that is permeating throughout American culture and that simply is not true it is the lie that is disadvantaging black Americans and it is why African-American immigrants are always successful when they come to this country when weighed against the successes of black Americans who have been here forever so if this country was going to punish you based on the color of your skin right then wouldn't African immigrants be punished okay why are they doing so well next from s Moore he wrote it always blows my mind how people are allowed to go after Candace a black woman who speaks her mind and they say horrible terrible things about her things that if anyone said about any other person of color they would be blown off Twitter and Facebook in a heartbeat I guess it's the old thing if not for double standards they would have no standards at all that is true but I am used to it and I'm just glad that I'm able to be here and to show people how hypocritical they are to show them that they are not genuine in their intent to want to platform black Americans and just give them attention uh you know just give them a shot at success in America and to have black voices heard it's not true they want to use black American emotion to further their own causes and it is why they find me to be so problematic because I refuse to be a voice to anything but the truth alright

for you guys can you name the most radical religion today why don't you think about that I'm also going to give you two hints ready the first hint is this religion still practices indulgences you know believing that they can buy their way into some Promised Land second hint is that children that are brought up in this religion believe it if they do not abide by their leaders commands they're going to die take a minute and think about that I'm going to reveal the answer in just a minute plus DeSantis takes a page out of Greg Abbott's book and sends two planes carrying more than 50 Venezuelan migrants to the upscale Martha's Vineyard all that and more today on Candace Allens [Music] all right so I just gave you guys a pop quiz because I feel like that's the right thing to do on a Friday I'm gonna make sure you guys are paying attention all week and the pop quiz was can you name the most radical Religion Today ready for the answer the answer is of course environmentalism environmentalism is the most radical religion today and I can't say enough about that every time I examine this cult because that's what it is is it actually a cult I just cannot stop remarking on how it has been impressed upon our children think about it you've read the headlines of kids that are skipping school they're leaving school because they just can't deal with the idea that not more is being done to clean up the climate to clean up carbon emissions that people don't care that they're all going to be dead in 10 years they actually believe us kids believe that they're going to be dead in 10 years if they don't do something about the climate and by the way in case you're thinking this is new and it suddenly became radicalized no I think the most amazing part of the climate change Lobby or the environmentalism religion is the fact that they never ever ever get into trouble for lying to the previous generations now when I was in school it wasn't climate change that wasn't the buzzword it was global warming and so we all had to sit around in classroom and we had to watch Al Gore in his movie Inconvenient Truth I still have it burned into my brain the polar bears that they said were all going to drown and they were going to die because the Earth was warming and we should be concerned about the polar bears why wouldn't we be well actually um the polar bear population today has increased since that time that his movie came out about Inconvenient Truth so that's kind of An Inconvenient fact so we shouldn't pay attention to that but the idea was to traumatize us they had a captive audience in public school systems to traumatize us to become a little activists for a cause that we believe that we could help if we I don't know maybe left school or if we showed up in protest if we demanded that our parents do something stop the Earth from warming as if that could be done but they stopped using they stopped talking about global warming because actually for a couple of years the earth atmosphere cooled around 2011 and so it was no longer fashionable to traumatize children about the Earth warming but before global warming there were other incidences don't forget there was notoriously degeneration that was terrified about the ozone layer there's a hole in the ozone layer kids be terrified scared become activists and of course that never quite panned out either then there was a generation which may have been my parents generation that was told the opposite of global warming the opposite of global warming was global cooling that the temperatures were going to get so low and they were all going to freeze to death unless of course they became activists for the cause get out there do something again that captive audience in classrooms learning that things were going to go really badly maybe animals were going to die Humanity was not going to be able to survive this period of global cooling but of course that never panned out I think my favorite environmentalist scare when I think about it and I learn about it my favorite one the one that really makes me chuckle and in a bad way by the way if you were part of this generation I'm so sorry uh but they were the generation that were told to be fearful of acid rain the oceans were going to become so acidic that eventually what was going to happen after the process of condensation and evaporation was they were going to have a rainstorm an acid was going to fall from the sky I mean just picture the children a part of that generation who must have been terrified every time it rained and maybe you're okay if you were living in I don't know Arizona where it's pretty dry and it doesn't rain that much but imagine being a child in Seattle I mean that's just that's just not fun honestly but again the ipcc was wrong their predictions are always wrong but it doesn't matter they come up with a new thing and I think finally what they realize is it's easier to just say climate change right it's kind of an all-catch phrase climate change the climate's always changing so let's just blame everything now we if it's too cold we'll say climate change if it's too hot we'll say climate change if it rains too much we'll say climate change if it doesn't range rain enough we'll say climate change and that's what they're doing today so children are terrified every time I don't know weather happens I mean I grew up in Connecticut we had four seasons I wonder if the kids that are growing up in Connecticut now are scared every time they're on the brink of what we used to just call I don't know spring fall summer winter this is what happens when you're raised in a cult and you can't understand that you're being raised and occult and the question is why are they focusing on children so much you see this religion even has its religious figures the people that they have minted to be a a form of Jesus Christ you know for the cause and I hate to say that because it's so Blasphemous to even say that but it's true right let's not forget I know she's been absent and gone and nobody cares anymore but let's not forget the manner and the ways in which Greta thundberg was completely exalted throughout the media yeah you probably forgot about her nobody talks about Greg anymore remember she was the hero nobody could say anything bad about Greta thunderberg she was everywhere every time you touched a magazine every time he clicked an article it was all about Greta thunderberg the brave girl who skipped school and got on ships and trains and here's a picture I've got a fun park on a ship I think she sailed the ocean she sailed the Atlantic like Christopher Columbus and people cheered her on on the sidelines you go Greta you cut class you do it you're gonna save the environment somehow by I don't know being on a ship and crossing the Atlantic oh the new Heroes that we meant in this day and time I wish people by the way applauded me when I cut school I did that a lot in high school I never never ever got applauded I got told I was gonna flunk class if I had two two cuts I wish my teacher what you go girl I should have said doing it for the environment not for my high school boyfriend who I actually just kind of want to grab McDonald's with but for the environment but nope Greta thundberg Untouchable honestly her parents just letting her skip school Untouchable don't say anything we love her in fact they were so radical in this love for Greta thunderberg that if you spoke anything against her you were going to be in very big trouble one person who sacrificed on the altar of Greta thunderberg and all that was her was my colleague and friend and The Godfather to my daughter Michael Knowles here at the daily wire don't forget Michael Knowles went on Fox News and he was debating some lib about Greta thundberg and he made the mistake of telling the truth take a look the climate hysterian movement is not about science if it were about science it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international law so what you're seeing here is a political movement and a religious movement and it's a fulfilling religious and political goals of the left but it isn't doing very much for science Chris you had a visceral reaction to that go ahead yeah I mean you're a grown man and you're attacking a child shame on you she's trying to do an attacking the lessons relax skinny boy I got this okay you're attacking a child you're a grown man have some nut I'm attacking the left maybe on your maybe on your podcast you get away and say whatever you want because nobody's listening you're on National Television be a grown-up when you're talking about children wow I love that he's like nobody attacks my baby Jesus nobody attacks baby just nobody attacks going out there she's a child that was their favorite thing to say of course because that's what they were doing they were using children to fulfill things that they wanted to get done she's a child of how he starts with how dare you that's kind of the most famed moment of everything that Greta thunderberg has ever said remember that moment at the United Nations nobody knows how a child is allowed to skip school and end up the United Nations but somehow Greta thundberg did it and she sort of said how dare you how dare you by the way in defense of Michael Knowles everything he said of course is true he wasn't referring to her as a mentally ill child because he came up with that idea her mother said that she was mentally ill she talked about how Greta thundberg struggled with her autism and things of that nature and yet despite this they were using her the Press loved to use her they exalted her and made her a person of character that could not be assassinated and they loved playing the she's just a child really she was 17 she was on the brink of adulthood but she wore her hair and pigtails to make sure that people always had in her in their mind that she was like I don't know like a six-year-old you know they she played the part she dressed the part and people said you cannot say anything about her but of course we all know the reason that they used her like they used all children is because there's always something happening in the background there's always something that they are trying to fulfill that is what the climate Lobby and the climate religion is all about they're trying to get things done that are more nefarious and they're willing to use children to accomplish those goals which brings me to Gavin Newsom you guys know Gavin Newsom he looks like a villain from a Batman movie he really does if Gavin knew some if I was playing sonic I would expect him to be the boss at the end or something he looks like a video game character with his greasy slicked back hair yeah well he's announced that California is Banning the sale of new gasoline-powered Vehicles starting in 2035 which marks a historic step in the state's battle against you guessed it climate change the rural Force automakers to speed up production of cleaner Vehicles beginning in 2026 and it was a unanimous boat which came after Gavin Newsom set a Target in 2020 to accelerate the shift away from internal combustion engines now could their right mind believes actually that Gavin Newson cares about the climate that Gavin Newsome like politicians before him and beside him just really care about the future of children even though they keep lying they keep lying about every climate disaster and for whatever reason they convince people that if they pay these indulgences right don't forget indulgences or what led to protestantism the Catholic church was saying you can buy your way into heaven just give us money you just give us money give us what you have and you'll be able to go to heaven well this is the climate Lobby right the climate Lobby says more tax dollars all you have to do is give us more tax dollars trillions of dollars all we have to do is agree to enter something as useless as the Paris Accord to actually believe that if you give more money somehow you'll be able to live longer right it just some just give us your money tax dollars and we'll start all these incentives and somehow you will be able to live longer that is what people are believing in their head but who really thinks that Gavin Newsom cares about the future of children and that's his incentive for doing this and by the way it's not just happening this Banning of these vehicles not just happening in America it's not just a his attempt to push these policies in America it's also overseas it's happening in Europe right they made the same commitment we're just going to ban it so whenever you see a bunch of politicians that are in lockstep on something as absurd as Banning gasoline vehicles you should know that something else is happening and that's something else is that they're already invested they're already invested in electric vehicles as everybody knows Nancy Pelosi's husband is Trader of the year every year if you haven't figured it out yet it's not exactly living in a free market Society we're living in a society that is marked by its corrupt politicians corrupt politicians that do deals behind closed doors right corrupt politicians that decide what they want to invest in and then they force the sale of whatever that investment is to us that is the story of course of covet these deals for the vaccines if you don't think the FDA officials in lockstep with the big pharmaceutical companies in lockstep with the politicians behind closed doors that is what happened they said okay we're going to force the sale we're going to use government dollars right and we're going to say that we must purchase all of these life-saving vaccines I'm Still Holding Out for how many lives were saved from these vaccines my guess is Gavin newsom's I don't know savings or saved right that increased by these vaccines Nancy Pelosi's husband Nancy Pelosi herself we know what they do these deals behind closed doors we know this right and the same exact thing that happened with code with covid with the vaccines the fourth shot yeah that was all decided way before way before but here we are it's going to be the same thing for this push for electric vehicles right the deal's already been done they're all long on the stock of the battery and now comes legislation and what they need to do of course is to harness our fears covid's gonna kill you if you don't want this vaccine wear a mask save lives right the planets going to end if you don't get out and argue for electric vehicles never mind the fact that the Californian power grid can't sustain it never mind that we're sending out notices in California that is saying huh please don't use any electricity please don't charge those of you who have electricity electric vehicles already please don't charge those Vehicles which has been going on for the last couple of weeks last couple of months rather in California never mind that the right thing to do is to purchase more of these vehicles to make sure that our selfish politicians stay wealthy as I said these people are criminals we are about to get into some crazy new stories but first you've

time it is it's time for a little topic [Music] thank you the first headline that I have for you is regarding Governor Ron DeSantis we all love him he's just really kicking butt and taking names down in Florida so Governor DeSantis took a page out of Gregory Abbott's book and sent two planes carrying more than 50 Venezuelan migrants to the upscale Martha Vineyard where loaded liberals like the Obamas and Oprah Winfrey and Larry David own property you guys know Martha's Vineyard that's where Obama the middle of covert threw himself a banging birthday party yeah because who cares what you peasants are doing I'm gonna enjoy lockdown with all of my rich friends and by the way I just want to say this I have to take credit where credit is due because no one ever gives me credit he definitely got this idea from me so let's just take a look at what I tweeted way back in April of this year um a buddy of mine who you have seen on many of my shows in the past Jack pesobic he tweeted in response to the idea of Governor Abbott busing illegals he said quote busing illegals to DC doesn't seem to be doing much of anything and so I applied to his tweets and I said bus them to Martha's Vineyard Common Sense solution I mean I I love the idea of busting them to DC and it creates issues but if you really wanted to make an impact turning them into their Heaven Martha's Vineyard where all the Liberals love it out there right oh it's our beautiful summer if you began busting those migrants from the border into Martha's Vineyard policy will change very quickly it's it's the only way to really ruffle some feathers so I know that the Santa's team saw this tweet and they thought it was a good idea and by the way it's a great idea I'm so glad that he's actually doing it and I do think that it is going to make a difference the only way we're going to win you know we have Kamala Harris saying if there's not a problem on the border This Is How They think it's not a problem if it's not happening where I live it's not a problem if it's not happening within my gated community it's not a problem unless you literally drop the problem on their front door so kudos to you Governor DeSantis and team all right next up as a headline of course we're talking about climate change today well Outdoor Clothing giant Patagonia I love them by the way the owner is 83 years old and he has decided to give his entire three billion dollar firm away to a trust with all profits going to fight climate change and he has declared Earth is now our only shareholder love the sentiment there love the sentiment I Earth is our only shareholder I think what he meant was the politicians on Earth are our only shareholder and let me tell you something I just can somebody explain to me how people think that giving money right to politicians is is going to somehow change the environment it's just it's stunning to me this is why I call it a religion because explain to me how it's going to happen right explain to me how you're going to take trillions of dollars and you're going to somehow affect change in the climate now there's been this whole demonization of carbon somehow people think that carbon is bad for the environment it's not they talk a lot about carbon emissions and they never talk about China you know they are the majority of carbon emissions comes from China and China has never once entered a pact or an agreement or committed to fighting the climate change Lobby because they don't care China does not care it's just something that Western Civilization is doing right to in my opinion disempower us I think that's not even an opinion that's a fact right China has risen up they are now the future of businesses in China because they don't care they're not going to play with the left's games this is what happens by the way when we have a arrived so suddenly into this culture of weak men a culture of weak men we're no longer inventing ideas we're too comfortable this is what happens when you have people that are being raised with remarkable privilege right there's no suffering really in America so we start experimenting with these abstract ideas like well let's sit around at Martha Vineyard and talk about how we can get these peasants to give us more oh there's no there's no suffering Happening Here this is what happening this is what happens when we have been too cushioned as a society right and it's it's just sad to see that people are being raised in this Cult of fiction that there are children who believe this somehow that more sacrifice to government more sacrifice to governance is going to somehow render them a longer life and the only way that we can stop that is by having discussions right household to households you teach your children about the BS narratives right surrounding climate change and I have said that there is a book that is remarkable it's super skinny that you can read it's a book written by Gregory Whitestone which is called inconvenient facts I'm going to recommend that book if you're a parent you're going how can I get my child who is being deluded by teachers day in and day out to wake up to the lives surrounding the climate change Lobby you can give them this book like I said they can read it in seconds you can read it to them it's I read it in one day and it really just debunks all of the lies it's ridiculous that we're terrifying children in order to enrich the pockets of politicians next story that I just had to report on today because I thought this is bizarre and dark and we should think about this it was about a werewolf killer who has stabbed 65 year old stranger 50 times and he now poses on dating apps and here's what he says about himself on those dating apps he describes himself as an easy going adventurer who just got back from two years of travel uh after actually he was released from prison for stabbing somebody 50 times and he's just on a dating app that is terrifying absolutely terrifying that somebody that violent just gets out of prison I don't even know why he's out of prison by the way and could be on a dating app and I do want to talk more I'll probably do it on next week's episode about this sort of technological era how things have shifted and people are now doing online dating I want to talk a little bit more about the safety of a lack of safety they're in and how much it's actually contributing uh to these bad relationships that we're seeing we've kind of seeded what used to be normal correspondence between two human beings to the sort of quick pick what do you look like what are the facts you can give me about yourself actually not always facts as we just learned with this topic you might be a serial killer but it doesn't matter because this is how we are dating I think if that is leading to the the destruction of our society and the destruction of functional relationships between men and women alright guys that's all I have in terms of the headlines of the week the next portion of the show as you know as always is only going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to expand on the topics of today plus I'll share my thoughts on Andrew Tate we're getting a lot of questions about Andrew Tate who you guys know has recently been banned from everything and I actually know him since before this Banning so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "Kh_N-Z53EtM": "moving on to people that are never canceled all you have to do is say that you're a man you think you're a woman and you'll receive Awards you remember a few weeks ago we covered uh this person who bizarrely was it seems almost given a big following by Tick Tock we talked about how they are artificially uh creating popular channels it almost seems that the more perverse you are on Tick Tock the more likely you are to Garner a big following I don't think it's because people are meaning to engage with your content I think it's because China means for people to engage with your content China of course wins the more perverse in American culture becomes because it is the best way to attack us is with cultural Marxism right they're controlling a tick tock app which means that they are controlling the habits of our children as they are on this app and this creature Dylan Mulvaney came out of nowhere I showed you his video of him frolicking it almost seems like it's a joke of him saying I'm a woman and this is how I have decided I'm going to be a woman I'm going to put on a skirt and say that I'm afraid of bugs that was the video that I showed you um maybe it was last week a couple of weeks ago well Ulta Ulta beauty you know like the opposite of Sephora is Ulta recently just loved Dylan Mulvaney so much they decided to launch a podcast called the beauty of which features influential people like Dylan Mulvaney they had him on and they want their perspectives they just want Dylan Mulvaney to talk about his perspective on beauty so here is what he had to say on that podcast which is catching a little bit of backlash take a listen now I know I can find love I know I can still be a performer I know that I can have a family I want to be a mom one day and I absolutely can and that's why the narrative still has a long way to go because when I was grieving boy Dylan I didn't know those things were even accessible to me oh well I I means that all it takes to be a woman and if you're listening to this you're not hearing it he's dressed in a obviously wearing a bright red dress a big big bow in his hair or if he's like a cheerleader and I sing across from him is a gender bending host who similarly looks like a woman but has a beard because that's some other category of the lgbtq rstv community which I stopped learning the letters after the B I just I don't have time for it I actually just do not have time to learn the language uh anymore and so they're basically on this podcast mocking what it means to be a woman as I say now what it is it's become a caricature Right This Is Halloween they are playing Halloween appropriate it's just a couple of weeks away they're playing Halloween a podcast and both of them are appearing dressed as women and this is always have a female experience get a podcast and say oh I didn't know all this stuff was available to me but then I went on to tick tock and I realized that all the stuff is available to me like it's all I have to do is afraid of bugs that I like big red bows that I love dresses that I'm wearing some stockings so I'm a woman duh and it's amazing we're having a great time I'm frogging through the woods with friends I'm being called by Ulta beauty and I'm being asked to speak about what it means to be a woman right what it means to be a beautiful woman and I'm sitting across from a man who has a beard and is also in a strange way presenting as a female and we are now going to tell you guys what it's like to be a girl we're talking all things girly as two grown men that have some form of some varying forms of mental illness and that really what their mental illness is attention that's what it is there aren't all these weird categories of things to identify as that just suddenly appear in our society rapidly over the last five years I didn't go to school with any people that thought they were male or thought they were female right we just had gays and lesbians and there were very few of them in my high school class graduating with there these people weren't gender conflicted we didn't have people jumping up saying that they thought that they were animals or men that had beards but wore lipstick and if we saw them we would have assumed that they were troubled that something was going on at home we didn't have any so we couldn't even assume that but now rapidly everybody's got something going on and everyone's being given Awards and podcasts for talking heroically about their experiences their experience they should be talking about is what it's like to need so much attention right how desperate you must be to be so extreme on social media for likes that you dress yourself up like a woman and pretend that that suddenly makes you so that is embarrassing and it needs to stop moving on a story that should shock nobody researchers at Boston University's national emerging infectious diseases Laboratories have created a new strain of the covid virus echoing experiments which many believe led to the covid-19 pandemic the variant is a hybrid of the Omicron variant which spread over the winter and the original virus that discovered that was discovered in Wuhan with this hybrid having the ability to kill 80 percent of the mice that researchers infected so 80 percent of the mice died they created this in a laboratory remember that conspiracy theory let me ask a question why on Earth are they creating viruses and labs and why does it seem that every time an enemy of the West says that on a platform they're called a terrorist right remember on the show I talked about how Gaddafi said that in a UN speech years ago and then we killed him in Libya right uh we had Vladimir Putin who said this I talked about this in the platform in his recent speeches that there were a bunch of Laboratories in Ukraine where they were experimenting with viruses he was called a crazy loony person and he is now a terrorist and if you talk about anything that he says at all right if you talk about any aspect of what he says you're a terrorist too right political Satanism and you're guilty now too and you better come out and condemn him or we're going to create a peer pressure campaign I have a lot of talk about the fact that it just seems weird that people keep saying that this is happening that we this is what we do around the world and now it is literally happening in Boston as a fact this is just no plausibility that we are doing this also maybe in Ukraine or in other parts of the world is that just so crazy and and such so far into conspiracy land well unless they tell us that they're releasing viruses it couldn't possibly be true that's what I'll say unless the CDC who did I mention they own the science okay they own the science so don't even think about science because you don't own it you're not a partial owner so there's no IPO for science right you haven't bought stock in it so what they tell us is true unless they come out and they say that they are creating this viruses these viruses with the intent to spread them then it simply can't be so I'm asking you I'm imploring all of my listeners not to engage in baseless conspiracy theories how about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Meghan Markle saying that she felt like she was quote treated like a bimbo during her time on Deal or No Deal man I love that I love that when women go back and make decisions and then just change their minds so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "AcOz6EM5rjc": "all right guys happy Thursday question of the day today why do people get divorced it's a really big question probably a lot of you listening to this maybe are divorced or in the process of a divorce have a friend that is divorced it seems it's very common today to get a divorce and I want to talk about that plus later on in the show we're going to be talking about Brittany Greiner because she has been released from prison in Russia and what can only be described as the worst trade deal ever executed not in the history of America possibly in the history of humanity yep all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] okay so as we get deeper and deeper into my podcast series you guys are learning a lot of tidbits about me I always talk about Reddit feeds and I'm tremendously interested in and I feel as though the Reddit feeds that you follow probably say more about you than the Reddit feeds themselves I am strangely fascinated I'm just going to come out right now with it I'm strangely fascinated regarding Reddit feeds pertaining to canceled weddings I'm talking about people that go through the Pains of sending out the invites to the weddings and then suddenly maybe a week before a month before they decide to just flat out cancel the weddings they email everybody and they say we are so sorry but this wedding is no longer taking place it's shocking to me it shocks me I need to know more when I hear these stories of people that are canceling their weddings I don't know how common it is in my entire life I only know one couple that did this and it actually went viral it was a young woman from my hometown in Stanford that sent out what can only be described as a completely Psychopathic email to her bridesmaids basically telling them that they needed to look hot and that this wedding was not about them that they needed to be thin and that if they couldn't afford to do things in this wedding she's sorry that they're poor it was glorious you might remember this went quite viral at the time and it was a girl that I knew in fact her and I dated the same guy in high school that was not the guy that she was marrying but it was it was just oh my goodness and then eventually I think her fiance made the right decision he canceled the wedding because the writing was on the wall now regarding canceling a wedding beforehand a lot of those people feel shame in doing that it's very embarrassing it's a tremendous amount of embarrassment to go through just cancel a wedding but I have to say I think it takes a tremendous amount of courage to do that think about that as opposed to suspending that and just going through with it knowing in your gut that something is wrong but oh well we already sent out the invites you're sparing yourself a divorce you're sparing yourself later trauma because you're recognized you know this is not going to work long term so I don't think those people should feel ashamed even if they do feel a little bit embarrassed because we've all been to those weddings you know we've all been to those weddings where we sat in the audience and we thought not really sure if this one's going to go the distance maybe they'll have a couple of kids and they've got the kids in common for a while but these two just aren't really In Love sometimes there are those relationships speaking of which that just lasted too long you know they've been dating for a long time and it was like okay well what are we gonna do next I guess we should get engaged but they didn't have that thing that passion for each other that you thought might go the distance so I'm talking about the topic today because my husband sent me a really interesting article yesterday pertaining to divorces and then I kind of went on a deep dive into the topic of divorce you guys know the statistics they vary from year to year but approximately 50 of people in America that get married will wind up in a divorce what's also interesting is that 80 percent of those divorces are being initiated by women not men sometimes that could just be a courtesy by the way men just allow women to file for divorce even if it's because they are leaving the marriage women will file the paperwork but it does tend to be that women today are initiating divorces at a higher rate than men are so this got me into the uh got me even more interested in why it is that women are doing this well an article kind of went through all of the reasons and this the study was done by people uh by psychologists that were speaking to people in couples therapy and here are some of the reasons ready one reason is because after 50 you realize that you have more yesterdays than tomorrows why being a Loveless marriage in that same article they talked about a guy who was a professor and was driving in the car with his wife they've been married for a long time and she looked over and she said do you want to get a divorce and the guy came back and said I don't care that's horrible that by the way that is I think the worst possible answer to do you want to get divorced I'd Rather somebody say yes I want to get a divorce then I don't care right that sort of nothingness of whatever you want to do it's fine that's a good response if you're asking somebody hey what do you want for dinner I don't care I might say that do you want a divorce I don't care and then following that discussion she did file for divorce and his reason was simply that he just realized that he wasn't happy they didn't have much longer to live life why would you want to feel that you were in a Loveless marriage and that there was no passion in your life another common reason people get divorced is because they realize as I mentioned earlier that after having children and raising those children those children are outside of the house they go wait a minute what are we even have in common we've just been investing ourselves and our children day in and day out but you and I it's not really a connection here so you'll see that once the children get older a lot of divorces tend to happen and I'm talking by the way about divorces that take place after 10 years after a decade they seem to surprise us more you think you've been together for 10 years already why would you just why would you guys just leave one another after that but this is the next reason which I was fascinated by because it makes so much sense to me ready this is a true statistic college educated women are more likely to divorce their husband husbands that's a fascinating fascinating reality because it makes sense it makes sense you might be thinking oh well it's because these women are just smarter I don't think it's because these women are just smarter I think it has a lot to do with what they're learning right this particular study contributed to the fact that these women have increased economic dependence right Independence they're able to afford their Lifestyles they don't need to have a man in their life that is affording everything for them and what that comes with is a mentality right I don't need a man this is kind of leaning into modern feminism I don't need a man I can do everything by myself but what it is actually suggesting to me is that the education system as it exists today which is incredibly Progressive incredibly insisting upon narratives like modern feminism teaching women that they can do everything without having a man I think that the education system has become predatory to the marriage institution as a whole I talk a lot about how the education system is an attack on family right and what it is teaching women is to not pay attention to their natural biology right your biology doesn't matter it's all about what you think you don't need a man if you can you can out think your own biology we see this in so many different regards and it is disrupting the household because there is in fact a natural order to households and I am saying this from experience and I'm saying this from talking to my girlfriend there was a natural order to households that no matter how much you know you cannot out think your biology what am I referring to okay me and my husband we just jumped into roles after having children there was no book that we read it wasn't because I believed it passionately or politically it just is what made sense it just makes sense to me when I wake up in the morning and I go throughout my day to be thinking about what my son is going to eat what my daughter is going to eat the next size clothes you know my son is just growing he's just it's incredible how fast children grows they really do grow like weeds I'm thinking if he has the right socks the right shoes I don't think that that thought process regarding what my children are going to wear has ever crossed my husband's mind not once uh separately my husband thinks about their Futures he already has an account ready for their colleges it's already thinking about everything that has to do with making sure that when they get out into the world that they have a little bit of cushion of support it's never once crossed my mind in these early years yeah maybe later on I would have thought of it never crossed my mind right when having a child to think okay now it's time to make sure that we open accounts and that they have a college fund available for them it just doesn't it's not something that I think is instinctual for women that's not to say before people get upset listening to this podcast that men cannot step into that role right that men cannot successfully of course there are single dads out there you're probably listening to this podcast and you can do it you really can do it all and of course there are single women who can do it all that can think about their children's finances and can think about what they're going to eat for dinner and they do do it all but what I'm saying is that it's not natural that if you were left to your own natural devices you would find a certain Rhythm that comes after you which is being disrupted by not over education because I don't think these people are overly educated but a little bit of societal brainwashing I will add to this that I always say that it is more natural for men to climb the corporate ladder right for men to earn a higher income because they're investing more time at work than it is natural for women to invest more time at home we are the people that can carry our children we have instincts as a mother when it comes to that there are such a thing as maternal Instinct and paternal Instinct and I invest heavily in the concepts of biology of course it's possible as I said to mix those things up but women are naturally more emotional creatures right and this goes back to Hunters versus gatherers the last tip that I'm going to add here is that this article goes on to talk about how across cultures and geographies women who are economically able to take care of themselves which is usually tied to higher education levels are more likely to initiate divorce than women who are unable to economically sustain them themselves and their children okay yes that makes sense but also what I will say that I have seen in the real world is that when there is a man that is not working perhaps he is a stay-at-home dad and the woman is the person that is earning the most finances right the woman that is financially carrying the family to say it more eloquently they they seem to argue more is what I would say there is something about not being able to provide for his family that diminishes a man it does it's there's something that happens to a man it's why when men lose their jobs we talked about this this week that man who committed suicide when he realized that he was going to lose his entire job because his wife called the police when men lose their job it it's they suffer emotionally they it's more than emotional it's they suffer spiritually when they feel that they cannot contribute and that they cannot provide for their families so when you do create this inverse relationship where you have the women that are financially strong and and providing for the family and the men that are at home something is disrupted I want to talk about that and I want to hear your guys thoughts on that and I know that some of you guys are going to be very angry and you're going to tell me your personal stories and say I did this without this and me and my husband are just fine and I work and he takes care of our children I know that there are exceptions what I am talking about and what I want to hear about is the rule and that's all that I have to say about that Christmas is just around the corner and

installment of Harry and Megan which is obviously Prince Harry and Meghan markle's new Netflix documentary premiered last night and I did not watch it because I didn't need to watch it I knew exactly what was going to happen in this documentary series I actually told you guys last week what was going to happen because it's Meghan Markle is just the most predictable person in the entire world she's very predictable I knew throughout their entire relationship because I do believe that she's an emotionally abusive person that she is embarking on 40 and transfer she is using a real childhood trauma that Prince Harry suffered from losing his mother and she has used it to further harness him to her and their relationship she has convinced him he actually believes that Meghan Markle is Princess Diana okay so in case you missed it the documentary it turns out Meghan Markle is Princess Diana that's what she wants you guys to know she is Princess Diana and fortunately for Prince Harry this time time he got to save his mom I mean how sick is that me even saying that it sounds so sick but this is actually what is taking place so here are some quotes of what he said and the reason why he responds to Meghan markle's compassion and quote warmth is because it's just like his late mother this is from Prince Harry quote so much of what Megan is and how she is is so similar to my mom she has the same compassion she has the same empathy she has the same confidence she has this warmth about her that is disturbing on so many levels of disturbing it's assuming because this is something that I didn't want to be right about but it was so obvious and it was one quotation that she had given a while ago where she said that she was I think she was about seven months pregnant and this is when they were still within the royal family and she said that she told him that she was going to kill herself but she wasn't gonna do it but she knew while he was gone he was at some event and he got home and she said I was going to kill myself but I didn't do it because I didn't want you to suffer the same thing that you suffered with your mom she actually came out and said that she said this to him so I'm picturing a woman that is seven months pregnant with somebody's child and saying I was just about to kill myself but I know what you went through with your mom I didn't want you to suffer again and that obviously triggered because it's so emotionally abusive it triggered Prince Harry and that became the reason that they left the royal family and any person I somebody tweeted or actually earlier today they said I don't see how any person can watch this documentary and not feel extreme compassion for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and I don't understand if you if you feel if you don't feel compassion you have a Heart of Stone I'm paraphrasing but that was essentially the tweet and I have tremendous compassion I have tremendous compassion for any person that isn't an emotionally abusive relationship so emotionally abusive that they have successfully isolated you from your entire family it's not normal there's no relationship that you should be in that should isolate you from your entire family okay and the fact that he is in one that she is convincing him that their extreme gaslighting of the world is not taking place remember they left they issued statements and they did interviews all about the pursuit of their own privacy that's all they ever wanted what extreme gaslighting that everything that they have done to say left has been public you do not pursue your privacy with Oprah it's just not how you do it you just don't do it in a sit-down interview with Oprah and I would I would believe that truly they just wanted to help people by sharing their story if they weren't being paid 100 million dollars to do it right if they were just about wanting to share their story they'd be going around and doing doing charity and speaking to people that are dealing with issues and forms of emotional abuse within their own families they are doing this for money while gaslighting you and trying to convince you that they're doing it because they have a heart and they have compassion the only person that you should feel bad for in this story and allow me to remind you that he also lost his mother is Prince William because what his brother is doing is so twisted and again I don't think he's doing it to be evil I believe the person that is behind this perpetuating this is Meghan Markle she is smarter than him she is more conniving than him and he just cannot see the writing that is on the wall he cannot see that when you lose all of your friends and all of your family and you're ushered to America in Hollywood with a d-list actress it is because you are under the spell of a witch I do believe that she is a witch and she has cast a spell and the person that is suffering is Prince William as his brother does this as his brother digs up these old horrible memories for prophets I mean how sick and how twisted it is a family we have to spiritually protect family family is sacred and the way that he is treating it is so narcissistic and so Hollywood and so elitist because they don't have values and principles in Hollywood everything goes to the highest bidder they will sell their children they will sell their brother who is over there knowing that his brother cannot speak out on this Netflix documentary but they cannot respond that him and his wife and how it is impacting them and their family and their children who are seeing this in the Press day in and day out they're convincing you that all they wanted to do was run away from the Press right she's just like Princess Diana guys Princess Diana was killed because the Press just wouldn't leave her alone that's what Meghan Markle has done is pursued the most pressed in the form of a Netflix documentary the most possible question you could possibly receive and want you to believe that it's because all she wanted to do was to escape them and here's what's especially sick and I want to add this to it so Prince William came right out and said last year that the interview that took place between his mother remember his mother was conned into giving an interview that she was not aware of from a journalist at the he is a disgrace journalist named Martin beshear he completely conned her in 1995 and it was the interview was very famous because she spoke out about her husband Prince Charles but she wasn't aware that she was doing it so this interview became synonymous with how it taken advantage of she was by the Press Prince William again said that he never wanted to see this interview see the light of day ever again it was it was traumatic for him to see this interview being played because he's watching his mother being taken advantage of who sold the interview again well his brother Prince Harry sold to Netflix and they premiered parts of that interview in the documentary yesterday it is it is it's despicable it's disgusting and I I just feel that everyone needs to get on board and I see it happening already left and right we are agreeing that there is something that is deeper that is happening here something that's darker that is happening here and this this web is being very carefully woven by Meghan Markle but we should all be able to speak out and realize that this level of intrusion on a family Dynamic that I don't dispute of course families are complicated I have fights with people in my family all the time but to make a hundred million dollars and then 25 million dollars from Spotify talking over and over again pretending that you're the victim when in fact what you are is a shrewd capitalist yeah we we should all be able to renounce them and say that this is this needs to stop and you need to leave Prince William alone because he is the only victim in this story at this point okay so if you

happier story and by happier I mean sadder that's what I meant by happier justice but it's funny at least it's funny in a sad way but I'm sure you guys been following the Brittany grinder story she's a WNBA player and she got caught with cannabis cartridges going into Russia that's a big No-No it's Russia and she was sent into prison there and obviously this caused an uproar because how could a WNBA player who just wanted to smoke a little pot be sent into a sweat shop in Russia and by the way I have been vocal I thought the punishment was extreme for the crime right I'm not one of these people that's like oh no walk away every single person that has a cartridge of marijuana on them I think what she did was stupid and she's anti-American and she's constantly commenting on America but at the same time I think that this sentence was also extreme so I'm in the middle of this she's now been released in a prisoner swap which is just the most ridiculous I've ever heard they swapped Brittany Greiner for a merchant of death arms dealer Victor Bell a Russian Merchant of death that's what he's called arms dealer so I'm just trying to picture Putin getting his phone call because it's just so ridiculous ring ring ring uh Mr Putin America is on the line and they are very sad that you're keeping Brittany this is ridiculously smoking pot this is a very bad Russian accent but let's go with this right um okay America's on the phone again and and they're very very sad they say they're super sad that you have her what are you calling me about the emotions of the Americans I don't care about the emotions of the Americans okay well uh the activists in America say they're super deduper sad and they're wanting to know if they gave you your arms dealer who is referred to as The Merchant of death would you give them back their pot smoking WNBA player is this a prank no no it's it's just Western philosophy it's just America so they want to feel good they want to feel good so if you can just please give them their openly lesbian pot smoking basketball player they will give you back your Merchant of death because I don't know it's America and it's 2022 and so this makes sense in 2022 where everything is rainbows and sprinkles and it's all about how we feel not the practicality of what's taking place which is that nowhere ever in the history of the world would any sane individual say it's a good idea to swap somebody that is entitled The Merchant of death and is an arms dealer for a possible WNBA player two things can be true at once her sentence was harsh but also if we're gonna get her back it shouldn't come at this cost right that's the answer here and just in case you didn't realize how patently ridiculous the Toddlers and Tiaras that are running our nation are Joe Biden who can barely speak at this point gate had these words to share about Brittany greiner's release Brittany is uh is an incomparable athlete okay let's stop right there I'm I'm sorry did you say Brittany is an incomparable athlete who wrote this what are we talking it's the WNBA there's such thing as an incomparable athlete in the wnbh WNBA so for all three of my listeners who watched the WNBA literally I'm going to have to assume that there are some athletes that we can in fact compare to Brittany Greiner all of them probably can be compared to Brittany Griner because probably a high school male basketball team could defeat the WNBA I don't be meant to be insulting it's just a ridiculous statement to say that she is incomparable as an athlete but go ahead Biden let's see if you can stick in some more Ridiculousness Brittany is uh is in a comparable athlete a two-time Olympic gold medalist for Team USA she endured mistreatment and I showed at a show trial in Russia with characteristic grit and incredible dignity she represents the best America and best about America it is across the board everything about her she represents the best that America the best of America across the board this is the pretty grinder this is it this is the best this is americanism right here when I think of America when I salute the flag when I pledge allegiance to the flag would I wear red white and blue on the 4th of July and I am thinking about all of the ways in which I love my country Brittany Greiner is the first thing that comes I don't know about you guys I don't know about you guys but that's I'm like oh thank you for the brave people that have fought for our country's freedoms because it allows us to have hot smoking WNBA players this is really the best that America has to offer it really is and that is an extremely depressing narrative about the state of things today but it's an honest narrative I really do believe that the left sees this as they would that they care so much about how they feel on the inside that they would be willing to put our country at danger they would trade anybody to to protect a lesbian pot smoking basketball player I said that hates America like that's exactly what Love's all about and unfortunately what this really represents is the decline of the West that's the truth the West is declining we are in a steep decline right now because we have leaders that can look you in the eye and tell you that people like Brittany Greiner are the best that they have to offer so yes Putin is laughing because you should be laughing it's just most ridiculous training ever in the history of the world it's like trading LeBron James for Danny DeVito I like Danny DeVito I like Danny DeVito's movies but I don't think that the Lakers should take him to play basketball because it's a ridiculous trade because it doesn't even he doesn't even play basketball in the realm of politics Brittany Greiner being swapped for an arms dealer makes entirely no sense it makes the kind of no sense like swapping LeBron James for Danny DeVito for a basketball team would make it would be like swapping Pokemon cards and someone's like hey I've got Pikachu and then you come back at them and you're like okay I have Arthur the aardvark what what this that's not even a Pokemon we even say it doesn't matter because it's a trade it's the worst trade possibly ever that's all that I will say on that topic moving on this story makes me so sad I let me just say the first CD that I ever owned in life was the Celine Dion CD it was given to me by my dad and I just love her I think she is amazing her voice is amazing I still actually just two days ago and I did an all access live I spoke about how that morning I ran to a Celine Dion song well she has come out and she has she's revealed that she is now suffering from an incurable neurological disorder diagnosis she shared it in a video on Instagram and here is what she had to say hello everyone I'm sorry it's taken me so long to reach out to you I miss you all so much and I can't wait to be on stage talking to you in person as you know I've always been an open book and I wasn't ready to say anything before but I'm ready now I've been dealing with problems with my health for a long time and it's been really difficult for me to face these challenges and to talk about everything that I've been going through recently have been diagnosed with a very rare neurological disorder called the stiff person syndrome which affects something like one in a million people while we're still learning about this rare condition we now know this is what's been causing all of the spasms that I've been having unfortunately these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I'm used to it hurts me to tell you today this means I won't be ready to restart my tour in Europe in February so yeah Celine Dion is suffering from something known as stiff person syndrome which she explained affects something like one in a million people and and SPS is defined as a rare autoimmune movement disorder that affects the central nervous system the brain and the spinal cord people with this condition first experience a stiffening of the muscles of their trunk followed over time by the development of stiffness and rigidity in the legs and other muscles in the body uh I want to say this and I want to say this openly and you guys can critique me all you want all of these people that are popping up with rare autoimmune disorders most likely received the vaccine it is what happens when you get vaccines autoimmune disorders are very closely related to vaccines you know how passionately I speak out against vaccines I do not fax my children for one of many reasons this being one of them and I saw live what happened to a girl that was working for me working for my children she got the covered vaccine and then she developed her and her father both developed an autoimmune disorder a rare autoimmune disorder and she fell apart in the weeks I followed she was sick she couldn't get out of bed she was calling out of work saying that they don't know what's wrong with her she was going in and out for tech for tests she only got one vaccine by the way she only got the first shot and both her and her father both developed autoimmune disorders and it's because when you are inserting something into your body that is foreign you are forcing your body to have an unnatural and immunological response to it now this is extremely controversial I am controversial when it comes to vaccines I was the first person that said that I would not be getting it and I held firm in that anything that is being rushed out should not be something that people jump up to get now we know that there is a documentary that is entitled died suddenly I have not seen it yet but people were telling me about it and saying oh my goodness it has really opened their eyes about what is happening with the coveted vaccines coroners that are afraid to talk about what they are seeing and all of these young people that are suddenly dying Celine Dion is Young she's 54 years young the idea that she has suddenly developed some autoimmune disorder and we know that she's in Canada we know Canada's perspectives on the lockdowns trying to mandate people to get the vaccines I think that this should be a part of a conversation that we are having about what the government has done to people's bodies it is in my opinion a crime against humanity an absolute crime against humanity that people were fearful that they could never get back to their lives and unless they jumped on board and got a vaccine so you're going to stay canish you're jumping to conclusions it is a conclusion that I am happy to jump to and if you are a parent and you are at least interested in having this discussion if you have children even if you've already batched them I implore you to get more educated about vaccines on your own time I'm not talking about just listening to what people are telling you about vaccines I'm saying do the research do the studying I offer you a starting place for that you guys know that I did a vaccine series and That vaccine series is up and available on parlor.com you can find my handle it's just at Candace and I just went through all of the shots that you are told to give to your children or else they are going to die and I use sources from the FDA the CDC website and just helping parents understand what they are looking at and reading the inserts the FDA inserts and the warnings that come on these labels that parents are not given to right you you don't even know what you're injecting in your body your just trusting doctors and trusting journalists to tell you that it's safe that is no longer acceptable in this world of deception it is no longer acceptable when we know that there is a globalist agenda trying to get all of us in lockstep as human beings to do the exact same thing and not to see ourselves as individuals it is important for us now to be more knowledgeable in our individual capacity and more knowledgeable for our households so I just want to leave that story up there and again add that I am devastated for Celine Dion absolutely devastated she is I think the greatest voice certainly of my lifetime possibly ever I can't think of any person that I would rank above her you've got people that are in that category and Celine Dion is an amazing woman and my heart breaks for her and I hope that people pray for her because it's it's very scary for a 54 year old woman to be having to look at her life in through this telescope you know it's just very sad if you owe back taxes to the IRS or have unfiled returns now is time to take action the so-called inflation reduction Act is funding 80 billion dollars to the IRS allowing the government to weaponize the IRS by hiring 87 000 more agents will boost tax collections against the American people like we've never seen before tax Network USA is an A plus rated tax firm ready to fight for you their attorneys

that is real it is called a smart Girl's Guide and it's about body image and it contains lines that gives advice to pre-pubes on how to change their gender without their Guardians blessings parents are slamming the books and they're con they're rightfully saying that the contents are deceptive and dangerous and a passage in the book which is being marketed to girls between the ages of 3 and 12 advises quote if you haven't gone through puberty yet the doctor might offer medicine to delay your body's changes giving you more time to think about your gender identity it then provides a list of resources for organizations that the children can turn to if they quote if you don't have an adult that you trust the book was penned by a resident American Girl author named Mel Hammond and it is currently available on shelves and in bookstores across the country and on the company's website so it's terrifying of course it is terrifying and it is why I always speak to people as a mother and say that you can no longer trust anything that was once innocent they are trying to pervert this entire generation of children trying to get them on to the big Pharma train trying to get these women to believe these young women to believe that they can take puberty blockers and suspend their puberty which is of course a lie such an undignified lie because it leads to harm we know that these drugs are in fact long-term irreversible right this is this is not this is what we give the structure what we give to pedophiles right to chemically castrate pedophiles now an American Girl book is telling you just speak to your doctors and you can get puberty blockers and you don't have to worry about the rest if you don't trust that adults your doctor can help you to suspend and really think about your gender it is Godless I think that's the correct adjective it is Godless it is luciferian it is Satanism it is so dark and so twisted and I hate to leave you guys with bad news I wish that I could spend time telling you but the world that you live in is sprinkles and it's amazing and everything's going to be great everything can be great if we all do our part to remain educated and to remain Vigilant about the evils that are in this world the evils that are part and parcel of the education system and part and parcel of culture Hollywood this is this is culture American Girl that is culture so all I'm saying is be vigilant in everything that you are handing to your child it is not the same childhood that we got to experience we have to make sure that we stay on our toes and that's all that I have to say about that ladies and gentlemen somehow time is already up which means the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so I will be

questions [Music]", "uSsVD-oBuo8": "okay so Kanye West who now goes by yay west of course you guys unless you've been hiding under a rock know the story he and I in Paris at his Yeezy fashion show wore t-shirts that said White lives matter and broke the internet actually the morning after when I saw him he said should we respond to it I actually were thinking that we should just say nothing about it and just appreciate the art of the response right he is among other things a fashion designer and an artist and so it was fun to really appreciate that the response was the art the response that we knew we were going to get was a commentary on Society of course because for years we were told that saying black lives matter was not divisives saying black lives matter was not a form of black Supremacy saying black lives matter was a righteous thing to say people were of course then okay with people that said Asian lives matter because of course this phrase is not divisive you can just insert any except for white I don't know what happened there but those same individuals completely flip suddenly it became an expression of white supremacy it was not inclusive at all it wasn't saying anything it needed to go and I was comfortable to just allow people to scream and to shout and to appreciate the art in it but then Kanye decided that it was time to say something because he's not just an artist right he is more than that he has always been more than just an artist and a rapper and a producer and a fashion designer and he went on Tucker Carlson last night now you remember that everyone's been telling you but he's completely insane that he just does things that there's no thought behind it and you if you watched this segment on Tucker Carlson got a very different version of yay West take a listen so you just came from Paris Fashion Week you just landed in the lanyard and still on from it and there's a photograph on it what is that it's a photograph of a baby's ultrasound why is that and that you designed that yes why what does that mean well it just represents life and pro-life boy so you wear it on a badge what kind of response do you and and good amen I agree I don't care about people's responses I care about the fact that there's more black babies being aborted than born in New York City at this point that 50 of Black Death in America is abortion so I really don't care about people's responses I perform for audience of one and that's God yeah that my favorite response because I kept on thinking like you know people they're looking for a explanation and people say well as an artist you don't have to give an explanation but as a leader you do yes I think that's right so the answer to why I wrote White lives matter on a shirt is because they do it's the obvious thing amazing incredibly measured and profound and it's profound in its Simplicity right they do it is true White lives matter black lives matter Asian lives matter all lives matter and unfortunately we live in a society that is unwilling to admit that it is a form of racism when you're only angry when you say White lives matter right you it is such a strange time to live in that people think that they are legitimate in treating white people as if they're not allowed to speak in society anymore and how profound and how measured is he in wearing this lanyard and speaking to under this understanding that what we do matters only to God right and what is happening in Black America is a form of genocide what is happening in terms of the abortion industry and its deep history uh related to Eugenics and Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood actually targeting black families what is happening is unacceptable it is such a cultural moment that he has the courage to go on Tucker Carlson and to hold the line and not to completely collapse because people on the left are basically demanding that he become silenced they no longer want him the people in fashion we covered this yesterday Gigi Hadid the big models are basically saying he needs to go he's just a bully people were completely silent right about the fact that people are describing as mentally ill imagine describing a black man who has the courage to speak out on the death industry that is abortion that's just somebody that's mentally ill and Disturbed right that's not a form of racism but they've remained silent on those topics and they only want to speak out because he wore a t-shirt that says white lives matter really really think about what that says about the state of things in America moving on it is I I actually can't even believe what I'm about to share with you it's incredible if you want to talk about Black America in the context of what Democrats believe to be true about Black America we are emotional Silly Putty we are thoughtless we are stupid and we are undeserving of a conversation they do not believe that we possess even a modicum of intelligence which is why every time it is around election season they go out to Rappers that's what they do they'll go out to rappers and they basically say can you make a video or do an interview and just tell the millions of other stupid people that follow you to vote and to do as we say this is what they do right notoriously cardi B Joe Biden gave essentially no interviews when he was running in 2020 using covet as an excuse but he did step out and do an interview with cardi B and it was a mockery there was there were no intelligent questions being asked of him but she had a huge following well it's midterm season and they've gone out again to hip-hop artists this time Trina and an artist known as saucy antenna and they have asked them to produce this video a music video a song that's called No voting no bucking bucking spelled v-u-c-k-i-n-g but of course you know what it's supposed to mean the lyrics are essentially about how if you don't vote you're not going to be able to have sex take a listen [Music] [Music] [Music] so in case you missed the lyrics there they're on an app looking to have sex the lyrics are BLK app looking for some action swipe the homie Scott what's happening space is a nine ABS is a ten his D is a um to be determined he got mad jokes he don't seem broke the only red flag is he said he don't vote this midterm is for all the single cuties wanna hit this booty gotta do yo civic duty no vote in no [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is uh the explicit version the version that I'm looking at right now and the second verse goes on to say don't stop now stuff my Ballot Box again brought my homegirl through put the Buy in partisan okay I guess we're talking about bisexual sex now politics be so nasty make me wanna flirt you show you how to be a poll worker here's my I

you want to be a [\u00a0__\u00a0] you got to vote that's the message here goes on to say if you wanna come before the deadline come in this jacuzzi gerrymander this coochie foreign I have to laugh because if I wasn't laughing I'd be crying I mean it's just yeah gerrymander biscucci how's that Black America yeah we we're doing this because we're being inclusive not because we think you are so stupid that this is the only thing you'll respond to We Can't of course we can't just go to black people and say hey you should vote because it's your civic duty and it's incredibly important that you vote because the people that you put into office you're going to determine the future for you they're going to be controlling your tax dollars and they're going to be determining the future for your children no no no no no black Americans are too stupid for that give them no voting no bucking and to tell them that they should if they don't vote then they're not going to be able to have promiscuous sex on the BLK app and God forbid their coochies are not gerrymander I don't know I don't know I don't have to say to that um I don't know why black America is still not awake to the fact that we are considered stupid uh we are considered the dumbest race in America we are considered emotional Silly Putty they are laughing at us and they are using people that they laugh at to make us do even more ridiculous things to make us do their bidding I don't know why black America still can't see that but I'll keep reporting on it in the hopes that one day we might alright guys next

deceptions how the media is able to orchestrate a plot line against an individual and make you hate that individual essentially overnight they just decide what the plot line is going to be and they tell lies and I want to lay into that by just taking you through a situation that happened last night so at around 2 51 PM just ahead of my documentary Premiere event I received an email from the New York Post and they said we're here in Candace has been making calls on Kanye's behalf by the way this email went to the pr team here at the daily wire we're here in Candace has been making calls on Kanye's behalf and is working for him now as an advisor she is a part of a team that he is trying to build that will help him launch his presidential campaign for 2024. she has been a key enabler in him pushing his white lives matter message do you want to comment I can be reached at blank please let me know if there's someone else I should be reaching out to thank you I appreciate it actually getting this email because this means that they actually tried to execute some journalism and see whether or not the person that was clearly trying to plant the story was lying or whether or not there was any veracity to the claims and I responded forcefully and quickly that this entire thing is complete utter BS this morning I woke up and another iteration of that appeared in TMZ TMZ ran with this headline and they only reached out it turns out we were trying to figure out who they reached out to they reached out to an old email address of mine that has not been working since 2018 and yet despite reaching out to that they were in full communication with my team they know who the pr team is at the daily wire they sent a photog to last night's event so they intentionally did not want me to be able to respond at all to the email they did not want me to be able to respond and they instead wanted to write the email to lie to the masses and I'm going to tell you something right up front Okay because I'm very Furious about this article that TMZ ran the headline is Kanye West in constant talks with Candace Owens friends believe she's influencing him so let me tell you how TMZ is influenced I know for a fact because I've been in the room when this has happened don't forget I've been friends with Kanye for years I've been around him and Kim when they were married and nobody cared that me and him were friends and they weren't trying to pollute our friendship or make it seem like he's having a mental breakdown every time he's around me before all that happened I've been around in in the room when this family the Kardashians Kanye when he was with the Kardashians can pick up the phone and they can call Harvey Levin Harvey Levin I don't know how to say his last name and they can just call him and talk to him about articles that they want run okay this is a PR marketing machine there is a relationship between TMZ a direct relationship between TMZ and the Kardashian family okay so my Spidey senses are a little up because this article is very much written in the vein that Kim Kardashian is a saint and be careful because evil Candace is polluting Kanye's mind so I'm going to read you just some aspects from this article which they intentionally did not want me to be able to respond to they write turns out Kanye West and Candace Owens didn't just decide to wear their white lives matter shirts on a whim the two of them planning it for weeks oh that's an absolute lie just flat out a complete and utter lie in fact I posted a photo of me having the shirt stitched live what is the truth and if we wanted to reveal the truth by the way uh I think everybody knows by now following the Taylor Swift and Kanye West and Kim Kardashian beef that Kanye keeps a videographer with him almost at all times and he certainly had a videographer with him at his show the truth is that I showed up in Paris and I barely made it to a show he asked me to be there within about a 48-hour window before the show actually was going to take place so I packed up myself really quickly and I got on a plane I made it to Paris within hours of his show okay so the idea of this was somehow planned is ridiculous when I showed up he had two different shirts and he was thinking that he might want me to wear one was black and did not say White lives matter instead had a picture on the front the second one was the shirt that you saw me wearing he said which one which one do you think you should wear I said it's your show what do you want me to wear and he picked the White lives matter one obviously I know exactly what he's trying to apply AI White lives matter it's obvious black lives matter is a scam to tearing the nation apart white people feel like they have been left out of the conversation and have been treated like there's something wrong with them because of the color of their skin okay we're not defeating racism we're recreating racism in this country I have the courage to say that Kanye has the courage to say that Kanye has the courage to turn that into an artistic expression but now of course I don't know whoever's planting the story feels to me like a little Kim Kardashian attack I'm gonna be honest with you I know how this family operates and they've decided to make it smoke this was all my idea right like as if I could influence Kanye's fashion show are you crazy did nobody see the episode of the Kardashians early on when he made Kim throughout her entire wardrobe because he didn't want her dressed in these old Herbie leget dresses and wanted her to instead wear updated fashion which turned her into the fashion icon that people consider her to be today that was Kanye's doing he's a Visionary there's no Candace Owens getting into his brain saying oh here's what we should do with your show it's insulting to him as an artist artists to even pretend that this was my idea it's so insulting to him but let me carry on and tell you how I really feel with some of Kanye's friends some of Kanye's former friends right because with friends like these you're talking TMZ who needs enemies so I have Connie's former friends telling us she's acting as his chief advisor in his day-to-day life right completely ridiculous what does that even mean a cheap advisor what am I advising him to do do you actually think that every day I go here's what I advise you do you think that I think that I would tell him that he should go on to LeBron James's podcast or like how he should operate his fashion Parish show like I don't even understand what the meaning behind that is and the idea gets even deeper because they make it they're trying to imply that I'm taking Kanye's money right that he's hired me somehow and it makes me so upset they go on to say sources close to Kanye tell us Candace has been reaching out to people on Kanye's behalf working to set up calls meetings and appearances so basically I'm Kanye's PR agent I have not called a single person on Kanye's behalf I have not set up a single appearance on Kanye's behalf or a meeting on Kanye's behalf unless you're talking about his appearance last night at my documentary Premiere and I set up everybody coming there because I sent invites I sent invites to my friends I sent invites to my family I sent invites to my colleagues and I asked them to attend something that meant something special to me totally normal and yet they're trying to pollute it make it seem like it's weird they're basically trying to make it seem as though Kanye is not Kanye he's just an extension of Candace right now again an insult it goes on to read we're told folks who were close to Kanye and many have distanced themselves after his recent attacks believe he's in a bad space mentally and anyone working to persuade him to do anything other than get help doesn't have his best interests at heart so let me translate that for you Candace Owens needs to just tell Kanye that he's crazy every time they talk say you're crazy you're crazy you're crazy you need to get mental help and you should be nowhere and you should be seen by nobody and no one should be talking to you again with friends like these who needs enemies right they're upset basically they're trying to say we are trying to put pressure on Candace to tell Kanye to listen and to do what Kim wants perhaps right what Kim wants perhaps and in order to do this we're going to talk through the media and we're going to paint Candace like she's some kind of monster who's pulling the strings all untrue even better what's more yay showed up to Candace's film Premiere oh gasp in Nashville Wednesday Ray J was also in attendance a reunion sources told us was coordinated by Candace Owens to spite Kim Kardashian oh there it is Kim poor Kim Kim is a total Victim Because how dare two of her exes be at the same event like and and the idea that why I have been working on this documentary for close to a year I had worked on this documentary while I was pregnant I was attacked by the media who were in lockstep lying about the black lives matter narrative who are allowing these protests to burn down our cities I have worked to bring this story to the American people for almost a year but it really all came down to the fact that what I really wanted to do was to make Kim Kardashian angry how how narcissistic and consumed with yourself do you have to be to actually think this is true the truth of how it all ended up is that I had a separate I was building a separate relationship with rage it had nothing to do with yay at all not at all nothing done in spite of Kim when Ray J months ago started saying that the the Kim Kardashian sex tape was all orchestrated by Kim Kardashian like a journalist and like every journalist that reported on the story We reached out to Ray J's Camp oh my God could you imagine actually reaching out to someone's camp and trying to get an answer to a story rather than just running to it I reached out to Ray J's camp and I said I'm very interested in covering this because there are major implications here major implications as in this is a form of prostitution we're talking about a mother we've all been lied to that's the implication here right we've all been lied to and deluded for decades to believe that Kimmy's a victim when in fact what she wanted was to be Fame and she was willing to sell her body to do it that is a compelling story for any journalist especially one who like me reports on culture and reports on politics and believes that culture is interpreting the politics right we now live in a sex sells economy I wanted to often commentary on that by talking to Ray J asking him to join my show to speak at length about his allegations this is separate from Kanye again took place placed months ago okay so as I've been coordinating and talking to Ray J's team trying to get him to come onto this show I've been open about that fact I established a relationship and I said hey you know why don't we get to know each other you know I'm not trying to harm you I actually learned that he felt hurt by Kanye obviously he was open about that about what happened on the Hulu series and I said this is something that you guys should try to broker some peace between there's no reason to have two black men hating each other it's just I don't like to see black men fighting period you haven't realized my entire commentary on Black America has been the fracturing of relationships the fracturing of familial relationships the inability to resolve conflicts these are things that harm Black America the headline should have read this is amazing they had a entirely peaceful correspondence at the same event nobody gave a comment on the red carpet and said well Kim this blah blah Kim nobody felt that way Kanye was in great spiritual he was smiling Ray J was in great spirits and he was smiling and I felt this is amazing I was able to broke her piece hey what's up Kim why don't you thank me for doing that you harmed a relationship between two people and made them think that there was all this animosity between them and I said you know what there's not everybody come together but no that's not the narrative here the narrative is that my entire documentary was really about harming Kim well okay yeah that's what I wanted to do and so which one to hurt Kim everyone responds to hurt Kim Kardashian she's always the victim she's a victim I'm a victim of the sex tape I'm a victim of the Playboy shoot and now I'm a victim of a black lives matter Premiere event stop yourself sweetheart going on our sources say it's unclear if Candace is getting paid by yay as an advisor you want to know why it's not clear because you didn't ask me you didn't want it to be clear it said you're trying to insert a narrative that I'm potentially taking money from gay I am not I have not taken a single dollar from yay I have to take a single dollar from any of my friends none of them I don't ask to be paid to be friends with people in fact before the Paris show no one even knew that Connie and I had a relationship because I don't speak to the Press about these things until the Press attempts to create this nasty narrative One Source says quote anyone taking money from him is taking advantage of him oh okay was that Source Chris or was it Kim just tell us who who called Harvey and said this right I am not taking money from Kanye West I have taken zero dollars from yay West ever ever at all that I take any money from him so this is incredibly insulting and they say as far as Candace's involvement in Kanye's life she's gonna run him into the ground earlier this week Candace leaked an old voicemail from Kim to Ray J in which Kim called Whitney whom Ray J was dating at the time in old hag our Kanye sources say they believe Candace leaked the voicemail to show her allegiance to Kanye especially against Kim was there any confusion whether or not I was friends with Kim and Kanye why would I have to leak a voicemail right to show that I'm friends with Kanye over Kim was was there actually some confusion out there that I needed to actually do this to show my allegiance and let me talk about this is ultra insulting and I shouldn't even speak on this but I'm going to because it matters the truth of the matter is that in covering this yay actually asked me to pull back he said you know she's a mother of my children there was an instance where he said she's the mother of my children when I did that video and I said that she's a prostitute and he said could you please just go a little easy on her right now I said what I said back to him to be completely open is this is what I do for a living journalism is ready for a living the category the topic today happened to be Kim because what Ray J is saying is compelling but as a friend of his I understand how it is upsetting and I wanted to be more careful in my language going forward because I can see how that could harm her right I could see how that could harm his children rather I don't really care what she did harmed her children okay if raided allegations are true actually what she did has harmed her children and maybe if TMZ wanted to do some journalism they've quite put some pressure on the Kardashian his family to respond to the allegations I don't see any cease and desists coming out towards Ray J I don't see anybody say these allegations are false they sound pretty true then because we know you guys have the Press on your side we know you've got tons of money on your side so why aren't you slapping down Ray J's hand I would cover that I would say actually Kim came out and said that Ray J is lying she had nothing to do with the sex tape but she hasn't caught and say that yet so why don't you do your job TMZ and ask her about the allegations and stop making it seem like Kanye is a Monster who does not care about the mother of his children and who does not care about his children themselves he cares about all of those things this is a very very harmful narrative that speaks that adds Credence to the idea that black families cannot come together it's something that I hate I hate seeing families torn apart and I actually Hope from the bottom of my heart that Kim and Kanye are are able to resolve their differences I actually hope they get back together I hope they are able to bring their family back together broken families is a Bad Thing ultimately but don't do this it doesn't make it any better don't pretend but because I reported on something that was actually noteworthy that it's somehow Kanye operating me behind the scenes but also me telling Kanye how to operate in front of the scenes that's ridiculous it goes on in finally to say one of the reasons Kanye's former allies believes Candace is in his ear is because until recently he was conciliatory with Kim seemingly agreeing that she would have the kids around 80 of the time and he would have ongoing involvement in their lives that to me sounds like an intentional media plant uh that is leading up to some sort of a custody dispute I have no idea what that's about at all I don't actually it's going to be shocking to you I don't speak ta about Kim because I respect Family Lines I really do and it is not acceptable for any person to be in Kim's ear or to be in yazir saying well here's what you need to do here's what your genie no they need to sit down and they need to be able to resolve these issues as a family I do respect family and me covering a compelling story about the Kardashians was not in any attempt a way to disrupt their family at all it was just a way for me to do what I do on the show every single day report on cultural topics so TMZ you guys are are actual scumbags and I want to say this it's unclear whether or not the Kardashians have you on their payroll and we're reaching out to comment but we haven't heard back yet thank you for joining me today come back tomorrow for an all new episode I will see you then [Music]", "_Z_l2D2453g": "the nfl will play lift every voice and sing which is labeled the black national anthem and the star-spangled banner before every football game this season does america need a new national anthem uh no what a what america needs is a new favorite pastimes it should no longer be football or any sport that endorses segregation [Applause] might i suggest the ufc which is exploding right now and it's because they do not get involved in politics they are not woke and they do not bend the knee you know dana white we've had him on the show i'm a big fan of the ufc i think it's the only real sport left um it is just such a sad sad circumstance that we are in when you are quite literally claiming to be fighting racism while at the same time introducing segregation there is not such thing as a black national anthem uh versus a white national anthem that's exactly what uh my black ancestors fought to put an end to uh it's just so sad to see jim crow slip into this into this country again under the guise of progressivism so i say no we don't need national anthem but you do need a new sport do not watch it thanks for joining me on this episode of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get

you do anonymize your web browsing at expressvpn.com candace hello and welcome i'm going to jump right into this one my husband has a lot of family members who live in australia they're all wonderful people despite the fact that we do not always agree on politics they're kind of you know the old school type they don't really let politics get in the way of their meaningful relationships well recently he received a message from one of these family members and she was expressing how the mental state of everyone around her is in steep decline she shared with him a message that she had received from a friend of hers a woman who lives in queensland and the message is genuinely shocking i was shocked reading this message and i decided that for this episode i'm just going to read it to you verbatim so just to get you guys ready it's a list of the coveted rules that australian citizens are being made to follow and as i read this i actually want you to close your eyes and to imagine that this was your life and to imagine what your mental state would be like if you were being made to abide by these rules ready first and foremost there are a limited number of people allowed in your household and at various times she writes we are told we are allowed no visitors funerals have to be kept between 5 and 10 people must scan a qr code to go everywhere literally everywhere including toilets there are curfews and there are helicopters patrolling the skies to ensure that everyone is abiding by the curfews you are not allowed to go past five kilometers from your home just put that in perspective that's about three miles a little over three miles from your home you're not allowed to travel past you're not allowed to sit down at parks beaches and public spaces not allowed to drink or eat while standing up anywhere you must sit down to drink or eat everywhere no dancing anywhere only one person per household is allowed to go shopping for essentials only essential shopping is allowed and at times ready the defense force and police have checked what people are shopping for imagine that what are you what are you buying today that's happening dog parks playgrounds bike parks beaches are closed and barricaded mask wearing is required when outside and even if you are alone and at one point in queensland it was also required when in your car alone or mowing the front lawn international borders are closed no one is allowed to leave the country small businesses are shut down while big businesses are allowed to operate this this next one to me is the it's insane it's so crazy ready citizens are locked out of their home state thousands of them are not allowed to return unless they get a vaccine only after they go through a slow and restrictive exemption request process okay so imagine you live in tennessee all right you happen to be in connecticut and they say you know what you're not allowed to travel from state to state you can't go back to your home state of tennessee unless you get a vaccine it's actually unimaginable not being able to go home because you have to be vaccinated not only that you have to apply once you get the vaccine to be able to go home this is what is going on right now in australia i genuinely do not know what to say to this except this for the last 20 years the united states has spent trillions of dollars overseas in afghanistan fighting a war which we lost by the way we were told that the war was necessary anyway it was necessary the slaughtering of american sons and daughters on foreign soil because we were fighting a noble cause to spread democracy in a tyrannical land to free and oppressed people so i'm going to ask those same lecturing politicians and media members a question now when do we deploy troops to australia when do we invade australia and free and oppressed people who are suffering under a totalitarian regime when do we spend trillions of dollars to spread democracy in australia australia currently make no mistake is a tyrannical police state its citizens are quite literally being imprisoned against their will so when do we deploy of course i asked that in jess because we all know the real answer what's happening in australia under the guise of a virus which by the way as of august 7 2021 experts estimate the overall recovery rate is between 97 and 99.75 percent what's actually happening under the guise of this virus is federal overreach tyranny totalitarianism the kind that gives birth to evil dictatorships and human atrocities we are watching a replay of the early ambitions of joseph stalin adolf hitler fidel castro hugo chavez that is what is hiding beneath the guise of this fictitious perpetual need to slow the spread we all know some more truths that what's happening in australia was meant to happen here in america that this current totalitarian administration is fighting tooth and nail to trample state rights and federalize america and if it were not for republican governors standing in the way we would be similarly stripped right now of our our most basic of individual freedoms can anybody by the way explain to me in simple sentences why the australian government is any better or any nobler than the taliban both groups believe that they have a right to a press and a right to imprison people for their own good are western governments any better anymore i can honestly say that never never did i ever think that i would live to see a world war over here we are in the midst of an ideological and psychological global war it is a war that

means the week is over did you know what else is over I was being sued for 20 million dollars from Kimberly classic she was a one-time Congressional candidate out of the Baltimore area and I have an update for you on that lawsuit it's over plus later on in the show we are going to be talking about an elite Chicago private school dean of students who was caught bragging on camera about bringing in the lgbtq plus Health Center to teach queer sex to minors that is a really big story and you guys should definitely know about that all that and more today coming up on Candice Owens [Music] thank you all right so let me jog your memory do you guys remember Kimberly Clayson Kimberly clay sick back in 2020 was running in Baltimore for a congressional seat and she popped up onto the seam almost out of nowhere because she did a flashy video and I'm going to show you that flashy video right now do you care about black lives the people that run Baltimore don't I can prove it walk with me they don't want you to see this I'm Kim Classic this is Baltimore the real Baltimore this is the reality for black people every single day crumbling infrastructure abandoned homes poverty and crime Baltimore has been run by the Democrat Party for 53 years what is the result of their Decades of leadership Baltimore is one of the top five most dangerous cities in America the murder rate in Baltimore is 10 times the U.S average the Baltimore poverty rate is over 20 percent homicide drug and alcohol deaths are skyrocketing in our city do you believe black lives matter I do the vast majority of crime in Baltimore is perpetrated against black people who make up 60 of the population so why don't we care about our communities the Democrat Party have betrayed the black people of Baltimore if the politicians walk the streets like I do they would see exactly how their policies and Corruption affects us all right so you get you get it the gist of it at least you have a black candidate young woman she's dressed in a red dress and some heels and she's strutting through the streets of Baltimore hitting all of the Conservative Republican buzzwords she's talking about this bad idea of defunding the police she's talking about families she brings up homicide drugs poverty betrayal corruption in the city of Baltimore of course these are all things that we as conservators Republicans believe to be true and people saw this video and they went wow and I mean when I say they went wow I was being inundated with emails of people saying get this girl Kimberly Classic on your show oh my God this is amazing it went absolutely viral millions and millions of views which actually turned into millions of millions of dollars to support her candidacy not I'm talking 8.3 million dollars is the approximate amount that she was able to raise on the back of that video that you just listened to and you feel good when you hear it because look we want to be optimistic we want to believe that the candidates are legitimate and that they're actually wanting to better the communities that they're running in what has been going on and I'm saying this separate before we get into classic is that a lot of people are doing just this though they are putting together flashy videos and they know that they are saying all the buzzwords that conservatives Republicans will respond to and then they're raising a ton of money only to lose because the districts are just so decisively Democrat that there's absolutely no chance that they're going to win in a d plus 35 District well Kimberly classic raises money AI actually was supportive of her campaign I not only shared the video but I also invited her to speak at one of my brexit rallies that was in Baltimore and we had a very friendly relationship she of course lost this race and then afterwards there at least appeared to me to be some sort of a spiral and she began commenting on other conservatives and attacking other conservatives I was among them she'd attacked me several times on Twitter basically saying that what do I do for how do I help black people how do I help platform black people and she was particularly unnerved at my lack of support for Juneteenth and basically saying that my commentary does not make it easy for people like her who are actually doing the real work in community in the community I got interested in Kimberly clay sick because some things that she had tweeted just weren't adding up and then I thought to myself who is this girl she spoke on the RNC stage do we know anything about her other than the fact that she made this video she's now attacking fellow conservatives and Republicans who actually is this person and when I began to dive into Kimberly classic and her background I was shocked and Disturbed when somebody had posted photos of her in a strip club and basically those photos indicated that she was either a stripper herself or she was in very heavily involved in the strip club and what ended up happening was that a stripper got into contact with me saying that she worked at the club that Kimberly klasic also also worked at that her and her husband were heavily involved in the club I did a video I reached out to her tried to get her to clarify whether any of this was true the stripper also made allegations that Kimberly classic was buying drugs illegally and using drugs illegally throughout her campaign and that she being a stripper had proof of that and was willing to give me proof that she was using a you know using drugs abusing drugs throughout her campaign and she basically said the stripper during this time that she had scammed millions of people who don't actually know who and what Kimberly placeick is which is a person that stripped for a living married a man who owned the strip club and this obviously is a huge story because as I said she spoke on the RNC stage somebody that is talking to you about family principles that is spending their time potentially as a stripper alleged in a strip club doing drugs is not someone is interested in family values in my perspective and I think that would be the perspective held by the people if they had had these facts presented to them alongside this video you would have gone wait a minute I'm not going to just give money this I don't know who this person even is I don't know what they believe in is it plausible that she's abusing drugs could any of these things be true and I post an Instagram video taking people through exactly that what the shipper had alleged the stripper I had a ton of credibility in my opinion she was tell told me exactly where she worked her Twitter feed backed up where she worked you know she did not try to hide or obscure her identity from me she gave me even more evidence beyond that and I found her to be a very incredible Witness despite me going to Kimberly and asking her to verify whether or not these claims were true she basically shut down blocked me and then threatened to sue me and the daily wire actually I'll read you exactly what she said to me when I came to Harvey's allegations and this is in a private DM correspondence in which I asked her pointedly about the photos that I had come across of her in the strip club so I said to her first there was a photo of you both I was talking about her and her husband at a gentleman's club on Pulaski Highway and a woman who claims to have stripped with you I'm simply asking you to clarify whether that is true or false seems weird to prefer a legal battle I obviously don't want to say anything that isn't true which is why I'm asking you directly wouldn't it be better to clarify she was already saying that she would sue and then she came back with this just like you were not playing with cardi B's lies about you I won't play with lies about me or my family either I will literally put you and the daily wire out of business what she literally did was that she filed a 20 million dollar defamation lawsuit against me here in Tennessee and then she literally did not put the daily wire out of existence she did not sue us out of existence in fact uh Kimberly classic has lost this lawsuit and not only has she lost this lawsuit but she is now required to pay me 115 000 because we have this wonderful thing known as a tppa in the state of Tennessee which is basically trying to deter people from filing from a list lawsuits and if they determine that you have filed a frivolous lawsuit I am I become able to sue her for the damages and wasting the Court's time maybe being able to sue her back for the legal fees and so I had my tppa petition before we even got to a hearing we were at a deposition her and I were sitting across from each other and in the middle of this deposition she completely folded and said that she just wanted this all to be over and that was that Kimberly klasig admitted she apologized to me actually face to face and I want to honor that apology by saying it is good to apologize but it is better to apologize maybe before you file a 20 million dollar frivolous lawsuit against me simply because I was telling the truth I told people exactly what had happened I did not try to lie to people about what had happened I asked you to comment if there were any mistakes that I made I was happy to edit them as I always said the entire time Kimberly came back to me when we were talking face to face and said that her you know her biggest concern was that she feels that a lot of people think that she he was dishonest in her FEC filings when in reality she was a first-time Congressional candidate and maybe didn't get everything right I'm paraphrasing here and that could be true you know I brought up the discrepancies in her FEC report it could be very true that when you go from somebody that is not known to somebody that is suddenly receiving millions of dollars you don't have the people in place that you can trust to deal with that in a responsible Manner and maybe she got taken advantage of who knows what I was most interested in when it came to the Kimberly classic story were the allegations that she was in fact a stripper that her husband was intimately involved in the club that she went by the name September as a stripper and if they were still involved in the club throughout her campaign and if she was in fact doing drugs of course not a single Republican would have casted a vote for her and so I implore Kimberly just come right out and tell the truth about what her past and what her history is and I also want to say to every single person out there because something happens you get a little bit of a following you get a little bit of Fame and people start to think that they can just launch lawsuits against you right that it becomes a threat but you got to be careful you better just fold I think that was the idea of this filing a lawsuit hoping that because I have so much to protect I won't fight that I would just settle and say okay you know whatever I just want this to go away because most people don't have upwards of a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars to even go through with this lawsuit and the way that I did to be able to actually fight it and say no I told the truth and I'm telling the truth and I have done nothing wrong here I was not malicious in this I reached out to her for comment I told the truth about what somebody else told me most people don't have the money to do that and so what happens is that people in my position it almost to me it feels like a form of extortion right to just to launch a lawsuit rather than try to resolve something meaningfully or honestly or to Simply give a statement if you think that we're getting something wrong it is so important that we stand by our principles and values that we fight for truth and yes it's exhausting there there's there's so much fraud going on in the world that it's exhausting the court systems are exhausting the legal systems are exhausting if we could just not fight it would be a lot easier but here's the thing if we don't fight then we don't win and I won against Kimberly clayseiff I I won I mean I couldn't have won more she lost this lawsuit and a lot of my followers said I can't follow you anymore I feel like you're attacking her for no reason nope nope I am telling you that there is somebody who has not been honest with you and as a journalist who wants to constantly bring the truth to my listeners I'm going to continue to do that and if I lose followers along the way who just can't bear to hear the truth then I think it's worth it and I'm going to include now a statement from Kimberly clay 6 Camp because I promised you that I would and and I want to make sure that I have integrity and also include her statement about the resolution of this case and I'm going to read that to you guys right now she said I felt it was best to put this chapter behind me but the facts are that my campaign and I operated at the highest ethical standards my commitment to public service will not be deterred by rumors and innuendo yep and you are an idiot if you believe any of that she felt it was best to put the chapter chapter behind her after 18 months of suing me that's that's when she felt it was best to put the chapter behind her after almost two years of going through this legal process if you believe that her campaign operated at the highest ethical standards then I have to tell you that you are a fool people need to be forward and they need to come clean about what they are involved in the communities that they purport that they want to change and I would say that any involvement in a strip club does not mean that you are operating at the highest possible ethical standards especially when you're so non-forthcoming about those facts that you would go as far as to sue somebody for trying to assign Clarity to that situation so there you have it that is her statement I also want to clarify one thing so I remember throughout all of this people were commenting and saying Candace why are you getting involved in a petty drama what do you mean a petty drama she raised 8.3 million dollars off of people in America who did not have that money to give right these are small pocket donors throughout covid throughout covid whose businesses were shut down and yet they said I think this candidate is worth it I believe in this person and their Vision who they are so much that I am willing to give what I don't really have stuff that I could actually that I should hold on to dollars that I should hold on to I'm going to give to this person because I believe in them and if that person was not honest and clear to the individuals that were willing to sacrifice that to them of course I'm going to expose that I do not like people that lie period across the board and there's a lot of lying in politics and who or people that benefit from those lies typically the candidates and the politicians and who are people that suffer because of those lies us people that vote for them people that believe in them I was a person that believed in Kimberly classic and I no longer do and that's all that I have to say about that it's no secret that this Administration has utterly failed when it comes to strengthening our economy and unfortunately we still have two more years of this craziness so there's no telling what that could lead to higher taxes deeper inflation I hope not but it's smart to be prepared that's why I recommend talking to Birch gold group about protecting your savings with gold gold is the world's oldest most proven form of currency when inflation soars and all the assets go sideways gold is still there this month you can get a

time for some topics to show [Music] I feel like Friday is a good day for updates on topics that we've already talked about well I want to first talk about Amy roback and TJ Holmes you know they are going through that entire Scandal because Daily Mail revealed that they're having an affair even though they are co-hosts for Good Morning America people are very upset about this because presumably they think that it's inappropriate for them to be a workplace relationship a lot of people feel this way just to be clear the ABC News president Kim Godwin made it clear to TMZ she said quote I want to say that while that relationship is not a violation of company policy I have really taken the last few days to think about and work through what I think is best for the ABC News organization and so yeah I think it's important to add that they did not in any way violate their company policy whether or not they violated people's emotions and their feelings and I'm sure they did because it's Good Morning America and it's less leading and there are emotions and feelings about everything there I don't see why this would be any different but some people wrote to me as a Candace I feel like you're defending them and no and by the way some people thought that I said that they were friends of mine I do not know these people from a hole in the wall they are not friends of mine and what they did offends me as a married person a Christian who believes in the union of marriage who believes in monogamy but I am separating my thoughts about that from whether or not it violates anything in the workplace if whether or not it's okay for people to date in the workplace and I still believe that the answer is yes because people do all sorts of things outside of the workplace that are inappropriate you probably are working with some people who are friends and do drugs together after work it's completely inappropriate it's Unbecoming a professional conduct but if they don't bring that drama into the workplace how much can you really do so I'm really saying this is someone who employs people that I think that you you do have to separate sometimes the personal from the professional and yet they haven't done anything but get caught having an affair outside of work hours people disagree with that I get it well as a quick update to this they did find Amy roback walking her golden doodle I don't know why they felt necessary tell us the golden Noodle's name is Brody in case you're wondering in Manhattan three it's been three days now and since they were indefinitely suspended and she seems very frustrated Amy roback we have a clip of her uh here she is morning how are you you guys I'm sorry thank you nice dog so her demeanor is definitely different the first day after the affair exploded on the internet her and TJ were surprisingly giggly they were still on Good Morning America they didn't seem to be too angry now she seems very upset and very frustrated and she's saying to them it's kind of over now you guys need to get a life which signals to me that things just got real and that they are probably not going to be getting their jobs back again something that I disagree with I and you guys can yell at me all you want you can say how could you as a conservative I am not talking about the way what I can get into their marriages but I do think that it is a weird thing if they did not actually violate a company policy to fire them and if they do fire them I'm guessing they're going down to give them a pretty big payout because the president has already admitted openly that they did not violate any company policy all right guys moving on and I am sorry to even talk about this topic because I only want to give you good vibes on a Friday but unfortunately there's a lot of bad vibes in the world and as it pertains to our children and we have to tether ourselves to that reality and be willing to continually talk about it there's this idea in politics that if you send your kids to a private school they're somehow safer than if you save them send them to a public school and there's some Merit to that and that you may have more power as a parent in a private school because when it's funded privately and you say we're not going to pay for this they the school tends to respond to that more quickly versus a public school they're like ah we've got the government on our side and so we don't really care if parents are upset about it right well I just want to let you know that doesn't mean that terrible things do not happen in private schools an elite private school in Chicago recently had the dean of students caught on camera bragging about bringing in lgbtq plus Health Center to teach queer sex to minors and this was exposed by project Veritas they are amazing I absolutely love James O'Keefe we kind of came up in politics together when he was just sort of getting started and doing a lot of events together he's a wonderful person who is doing incredible work real journalism which is such a rarity today they had someone undercover talking to this Dean and here is what that man had to say on camera I had like our lgbtq plus Health Center come in they were passing around butt plugs and dildos to my students talking about queer sex using blue versus using spit meet Joe Bruno dean of students at the prestigious Francis W Parker private school in Chicago which happens to charge forty thousand dollars per student they're just like passing on dildos butt gloves the kids are just playing with them they're like how do you how does this work how do I do like how does this work that's a really like a little part of my job so the there you have it he is passing out butt plugs to minors 14 year olds watching them play with it talking to them about Lube whether you should spit or whether you should use a lube and he enjoys his job his nails by the way if you're not watching that video and you're listening his nails are painted so we know what side of the coin he sits on lgbtqia alphabet soup Pride which I keep telling people is just perversion it's it's all a perversion this isn't about love is love this is about something much more demented and their focus on children should terrify you this is happening at a private school an elite private school in Chicago people are spending tens of thousands of dollars per year to send their children to pass around butt plugs I can't even it doesn't I can't even fathom a course like this at my I went to public school I could not fathom this but the world has changed so much since I was in high school and I want to give you an update because the school which is now obviously been under a ton of scrutiny for this a lot of public scrutiny has come out with a statement and if you're thinking oh Candice they're going to say that they condemn this you haven't been alive in 2022 in Chicago and any of these woke cities instead the principal of the school Dan Frank wrote this letter dear Parker Community we are writing to let you know that one of our employees will add a conference last week was targeted by a right-wing Fringe group of individuals that seeks to undermine and manipulate diversity Equity inclusion and belonging work in schools this evening the group showed up outside the school and attempted to confront an ambitious employee with aggressive questions a handful of students and family members were present this incident is very upsetting and we stand in full support of our employee we have put additional security measures in place and we will notify the community should there be any additional activity from this group regarding the school of our employee we advise members of our community not to engage with any organization that fits this General profile respectfully Dan Frank principal also a freak yeah that's it he's also a freak so if you're wondering how bad is at that school the principal is not shocked by this he thinks that that's part of diversity and equity and inclusion to pass butt plugs around to your students when they're 14 years old and talk to them about whether they use Lube or they spit that is he's saying that is the aim of this program and he's not lying by the way I stand with Dan Frank on that conclusion that that is the aim of the lgbtqia plus alphabet community they are trying to prime your children and we have talked about this this is what we're talking about we say they are groomers right what person outside of a groomer would watch a teacher at their school say that on camera with painted nails and not go hmm we're getting something wrong here right we may actually be having a bunch of predators that are near children because that's what is happening these are not teachers of anything these are predators who get off on talking to your children about topics that should be reserved for the home and should be reserved for adults quite frankly that's my personal opinion on it so just wanted to give you that story all right here's a story that people should be talking about the UN world food program is now openly warning that the worst major food shortages in

I think I'll tell you this all the time I'm like I I don't think I can have a friend that has a child on Tick Tock because I think that I would just be drilling into their head at all times like what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing Tick Tock is for freaks fly your freak flag high and that's what's going on there isn't a category you're not going to believe me when I share those with you they're called Reborn Dolls right they are dolls baby dolls and they look incredibly real I'm going to show you a video but in case you're listening to podcasts just have to let you know that these vid that these dolls look incredibly real they're supposed to be hyper realistic dummies that can be treated like real children and even given a birthing ceremony and even a heartbeat the purpose of these olives you're wondering why have they even been created they run you about a thousand dollars by the way if you want to get one of these dolls but the deeper purpose was for them to be used as therapeutic aids to help women that are struggling with infertility miscarriage and or loss of a child as well as people that are generally just suffering from anxiety and depression now I'm going to give you my take first and foremost I don't think that's a good way to deal with loss of a child is by having a doll and treating like a child I actually think that's going the opposite way I think that that is the worst form of therapy I've ever heard I'd like to read whatever document it is whatever study it is that has concluded that this could be helpful for a woman after suffering a miscarriage that seems like exactly the opposite of what you should do fostering someone's imagination and pretending that they actually have a child cannot be healthy in the long term and anything that is not healthy in the long term mentally you can find on Tick Tock right of course these women by the way there's no evidence that they have suffered from any of these things they just realized that they could buy a lifelike baby doll and this one woman who I'm going to show you has even gone so far as to take this baby doll to the doctor and that's I don't know guys just uh take a listen we are going to be treating it responsibly and she's still running a fever she is hungry yeah she is really fussy so we're gonna make our bottle again the doctor gave us medicine for her so we are going to give her our medicine so with her medicine policy so let's get into that I'm gonna put her in her crib just so I can have my hands empty Okay so we got our prescription mats she um our doctor our pediatrician prescribed us with some ibuprofen Okay so we're gonna put this in her passing but first we need to make a bottle actually no we need to do the passing thing first so we've got her medicine pacifier this has been a lifesaver for us two Americans foreign and she would think that's bizarre about this video is by the way it doesn't look like a fake prescription so I'm just very curious as to what she is pulling out of that CVS bag that she is putting into the real milk she's actually purchased real formula never mind that there was a formula shortage because women with big baby dolls are getting formula and she's making a real bottle and she is putting what looks to be real medicine inside of that bottle to distribute it to her fake baby doll and she's not the only one this is all over Tick Tock of women that get angry with other people that are like what are you doing this is not a real baby doll they get angry and upset because in their minds these are real babies and they are spending real money I mean she might even have already established a college fund for her child who knows how far does it go all I know is that if I ever leave this sign of work I'm going to apply to be her nanny I am I can't think of a better job I'll get into it with her I'll be crazier right she'll come up like shh she just went to sleep please no you know I know I know I know he wasn't acting good he was he was really bad he hit me when you were gone tell your mom what you did we're all going to be crazy let's just be really really crazy let's see how far we can take the crazy ladies and gentlemen keep your children off of tick tock I don't know how many times I can say that I have a question for you who is going to raise your kids if you are not around to raise them you know as well as I bet none of us are going to live forever and it's dark to think about it but there are some tough decisions that you should be thinking about like if you'd like life support or not and who would be speaking to your doctors on your behalf if you were in a coma most likely you're like the vast majority of Americans who haven't thought about this at all that's why you need to

Candace moving on I promise you guys also that I would keep you posted on that horrific story out of Moscow Idaho you guys know it of course the four students that went home after various parties and they suffered a brutal stabbing four of them were stabbed in their home they had other roommates that were sleeping and who survived this attack and there still has been no person that has been captured and arrested even as a suspect and this is mind-boggling to it I don't understand how on a public College University campus campus today in 2022 with all that we have all the resources that we have in terms of the money that we give to the FBI in terms of the strides that we have made in forensics that we still do not have even one suspect that is being obtained one suspect on their radar the police are completely met this is a brutal stabbing and the cases just see the case just seems to be getting curious and curiouser uh one of the parents has spoken out in desperation is said that essentially the injuries are not matching that two of the young ladies were together and one of them had a stabbing Hayley Gonzalez that was much more brutal than the other murders right so that is something that is not exactly making sense and why her stabbing would have been significantly more brutal as her father said that her best friend who was killed in the exact same room there's just there's nothing there's no new information that has come except for they believe that there is a a suspicious vehicle that they are now looking for and they believe that the occupants of the vehicle may have critical information to share regarding the case so I want to share that with you the vehicle is a 2011 to a 2013 Hyundai Elantra that was spotted in the immediate area of the off-campus home where the students were stabbed to death in the early mornings of November 13. beyond that it seems to be the only lead that they have if you know anything if you're listening to this podcast you never know you might know somebody somebody might scared to come forward because of how brutal these slangs were I just can't imagine being a parent and sending your child to school and having this happen and then being given absolutely no answers the frustration the pain just so much going on I just I I my heart goes out to these parents and I hope that you guys are praying for them that they get the answers and the closure which they may never have the closure but at least the answer is going to allow them to begin the process all right ladies and gentlemen that is all that I have to say on all of those topics how on Earth did time go by this fast we didn't even get to the Daily comment Roundup it's okay because I'm going to take it behind the paywall you guys have tons of comments a lot of interesting ones I also I'm going to read somebody's comment regarding when a woman should call the police on a man and some of your questions I love answering your questions one of you guys is

trending online after photos from his latest maternity shoot goes by when you say ladies she might be thinking oh his second child his third child i think he's on child number eight and they're all with different baby mamas except for his twins that were with mariah carey that's the same only because they were twins that came out at the same time um so he is uh outwardly against monogamy and he has leaked i mean he has uh put out these maternity shoot photos we can see them and it's him with yeah number i think it's baby number eight it could be number nine i'm not absolutely positive neither is he it's number eight right neither is he right eight that he knows about uh very proudly and i think what the internet was just saying it's just like you know it's just interesting that he each time he does do a full-on maternity shoot he's had so many in the past and he's done like with every single celebrity under the sun and women that he works with uh this is no different here just a few of them they're very beautiful shots by the way he's doing a very good job uh and there was twitter just had a lot to say about this and made some great fun of nick um does nick cannon not want to take up any other hobbies like gardening reading painting it says this person next person one thing nick cannon is gonna do is show up to that maternity shoe yeah he he's definitely showing up the photographer is when they see nick cannon booking them for a majority vote and i think this one's my favorite god go forth and multiply nick cannon personally i mean look i've spoken to nick cannon i think he's a nice guy he's very misguided here and he is contributing i don't know why people don't see this as a contribution to father absence because there is just no way that you have eight children um that are growing up in a stable household i understand that you have money but that does not take money does not take the place of having a father in the household um so i i the cultural significance of this should not be downplayed you know he is a very he has always been the nice guy and i do want to acknowledge that but what people are learning from him is not a good thing and these women how do you still mess with a dude that got five and six other kids i mean i think that it's it's definitely something to say too where's the guidance from these young women they're going out here and allowing this guy to have children with them knowing that he's not going to participate he cannot participate this guy's not omnipresent right he's not going to be in every single household but i do think it's troubling that nick cannon you know being on these young people shows or whatever for the children being an example he's setting a poor example for young men it is not cool to have all these kids it is more equitable for you it's more appropriate if you have children with one woman as the dollar becomes worthless every single day you have to transition some of your savings to something that is of worth and we know that gold and silver withstands the test of time that's why i use birch gold group and they will help you convert an ira or a 401k into a tax

questions that you need to ask them just text candace to 989898 to protect your savings with gold of all of the harem having black nationalists i think nick cannon is my favorite one because he's he's got very strange uh political views he went down this rabbit hole that was pioneered by leonard jeffries about how white people are evil and don't have souls and black people are the people of the sun and this was very popular in the black power movement of the 1970s and he this involves having lots of women and having lots of kids so his ideas are wrong and he's clearly gone down a wrong path i have to tell you though again we talk about silver linings to storm clouds it's sad that this is the standard today at least he didn't kill his kids we live in a country where 800 000 babies a year or killed through abortion at least he didn't kill them it would be to your point it would be obviously much better if he would settle down have all eight kids with the same woman i think that would just technically make him catholic i think he would automatically become or mormon or mormon is the other one but that would be good uh but he it's funny because when when nick cannon is wrong he's so wrong he goes so fully extremely wrong but he he actually is right in some ways that our present culture is wrong and it's namely that having kids is a good thing multiplying is a good thing but but you have responsibilities and you've got to you've got to do it in the right way as well right actually i think it would be really super interesting to have him on the show and like to actually talk about because i think he's just missing that chip and his idea as you spoke to a little bit here michael is that he believes that the idea of monogamy is somehow tied to eurocentric you know euros and trick white supremacist ideals and principles and it's like it's not it's just been proven over and over again that parent yeah it's just good just good right that children fare better when they grow up in a household with two stable parents that's just the truth and like i said the economics of this is not going to transform that like having uh checks sent to these women which is what they want this is why they're agreeing to it you know it's a form of prostitution i'll give you my body and i'll have one child so i'm taken care of for the rest of my life taxes yeah yeah exactly and and it's really sad so on both sides of this what you're speaking to is just that it's really sad and it is good that he loves his children and it is good that he's proud that he's gotten another eighth and eighth woman pregnant and family is good and having children is good just not in this particular regard but he's a broken man this is what we're experiencing a broken man if you you cannot commit to a woman you cannot you're afraid of it and so what you do is you find ways to make excuses of why you shouldn't be with one woman it's it's that i would i would argue that if he sat down here and you spoke with him there's a lot of things in his childhood maybe fatherlessness in his childhood that makes him the man that he is and it's really fear he's afraid to be solid to one woman maybe mariah carey hurt his feelings and now you feel like he can't commit but a lot of men who struggle with that they have internal issues that they're dealing with and they make excuses by coming up with these theories of why it makes sense so true hey nick did mariah carey hurt your feelings we gotta find out we want to get to the bottom of that you guys that's all the time that we have today thanks for

incredible to look at a man who was just so loved in the way that you were i grew up i listened to hip-hop all of the artists love you you are on tv you are this big celebrity personality everybody wanted to be like donald trump and then just like that the media snaps their fingers and they start what i can only describe as the most vicious dehumanization campaign that i've ever seen in my life how do you deal with that going from you are so loved love to never mind nobody is allowed to love you anymore because we say so and we're the media right once i became a politician and you're right i mean a lot of the hip-hop guys loved me and probably secretly they still loved me but i was on i guess mentioned in more songs than anybody and not even close and you know it was just it was sort of wild i'd hear it all the time where people would say hey i just heard you on this or that uh and it changed when you become a politician especially if you become a conservative or republican or whatever uh you see it all the time but it also works i mean i was i watched with great pleasure as mitt romney got practically booed off not practically he got booed off the stage over the weekend because people get it you know they get it they know phonies and they know people that we affectionately call people rhinos but they know phony people and uh when they see something like that little ben sass guys like that they get it and uh you know so it in one way it works it works doubly but the the the democrats are protected when you see the uh speech that biden made the other day and then they get on and they say oh that reminded me of fdr you know they know it's a lie it was it was a terrible speech and terrible just the delivery everything and they know that but the fake news media likes to try and make it like it was a wonderful speech a great speech wasn't it wonderful and they must go back into the back room after the show and just laugh at each other and high-five each other because it's it's disgraceful", "fbqbRZx72CM": "as I gain more access to the web of influencers in Hollywood I start to learn more about their deceptions and their lies and a lot of it is in my opinion evil and some of it is purely satanic when we talk about them influencing people to pick their own genders or influencing children um you know to go through stages of blocking their puberty so that they don't grow up to be reproductive human beings but they also Influence People in terms of weight right if you're noticing right now skinny is back in so I'm going to let you on a little Hollywood secret that nobody's telling you when I say skinny is back in I am talking about people that were embracing their curves for a while and kind of making the thick girl come back and saying oh now it's better to have you know everyone's getting the Brazilian butts and the big boobs and the implants that was the Hollywood Trend I feel like over the last five years but now everybody's trying trying to get dangerously thin again right anorexia is making a comeback great I guess I guess that's kind of the messaging that's coming from pop culture and I recently found out that a lot of these influencers are completely lying about how they lost weight now you may just have questions as just one example Khloe Kardashian we have got to really see her grow up in the public eye we know that she has struggled with her weight forever now she is half my size and at the very same time her and Kim both a both lost a lot of weight that is a fact you can look at pictures around the same time leading up to the Met Gala you'll remember Kim shows up at the Met Gala and she looks very very thin and she's wearing Marilyn Monroe's dress and people are asking questions about how she lost so much weight to be able to fit into this dress and she says that she basically just didn't eat and she lost a bunch of weight okay maybe don't know her personally that might be true strange that she lost all this weight at the same time that her big sister who has struggled with weight in the public Sphere for decades suddenly dropped a ton of weight and then you see both of them and they have maintained keeping all of this weight off and they're very very thin to the point that with Khloe Kardashian I would say it looks unhealthy right you're starting to see her vein she's actually looking older because she's gotten so thin they're not the only ones I'm just using them as examples uh so recently I found out actually that what's trending over in Hollywood is a shots an injection that celebrities are getting again I can't attach this injection to Kim and Chloe I don't know them or any of the other people in Hollywood that are doing this but you should know about it um and make your draw your own conclusions or make your own speculation about it it is referred to it has a two names it's wagovi and it is also ozempic I'm writing it down looking at it right here ozepik and wagovi and what it is is a semi-glutide which is sold under the brand name ozempic or wagovi and what it forces is for the body's stomach to slow down from emptying it basically makes the individual once they get this injection feel like they're full so they can literally just not eat so maybe that part of what she's saying could be true if this is what she's doing um so people are starting to get these injections all over in fact if you go to the website of wagovi orozmic it tells you that they're out of stock right because it started over as a trend and now everyone in Hollywood is demanding to get these injections these injections cost about fifteen hundred dollars every time that you are injected and variety magazine actually reported on this reported on so many celebrities that are turning to this drug and it even went viral on Tick Tock under the hashtag myosampic Journey which showcase people that were openly taking this drug and then showing their Transformations so this was initially designed Mind by the way to help fight the Obesity epidemic so this shot is not for people in Hollywood to look their best before they walk the Met Gala this shot is actually intended for people that absolutely need to lose the weight because you drop so much weight so quickly uh but of course everything that is bad Trends in Hollywood and it's not enough to just be a regular sized person which is what I would say Khloe Kardashian was that people want to be deathly skinny they're constantly looking for the Fountain of what they preserve to be youth they want to be they want to be thin they want to be beautiful they want to look like they're never aging and so this is what is going on in Hollywood now I want to tell you of course that there's no such thing as a miracle drug even if you think that losing that much weight temporarily is a miracle oh my gosh it's a miracle it of course has some very serious side effects and the things that um are included things that could possibly happen cancer it literally says that will Govi may cause serious side effects including possible thyroid tumors including cancer in studies with road with rodents will go be in medicines that work like wagovi cause thyroid tumors including thyroid cancer it is not known if the Gobi will cause thyroid tumors or a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma in people I mean that is on the packaging right you may or may not get cancer we can't tell you but when we experimented on rodents yeah they did get cancer so it would be interesting to see if a bunch of people start popping up with thyroid cancer in Hollywood let me tell you it is an extremely rare form of cancer so suddenly people start saying that they have it um I think it will probably point to the fact that these people are so willing so dying to be thin so dying to look good so dying to fit into a dress or maybe to fit into a suit that they're willing to go through these extremes and what bothers me about this is I'm personally a believer that if you want to you know how I am obviously my opinion on vaccines that topic if you want to do it go ahead live your life roll up your sleeve get 14 vaccines a day not my problem get the will go be shot you know what the risks are you see what the side effects are you're looking at these studies yourself and you're thinking hey to get into that dress I'd get thyroid cancer many times it's a one of the more survivable types of cancer okay totally fine but what bothers me is that because they are a part of Pop Culture right because they are creating this cult around them people actually believing that these women got thin all by themselves that no drugs were involved in this and nobody got an injection that they just starve themselves for a couple of days and now they're all a size zero because people are believing this what they're really promoting it's not with Govi you want people don't know their secrets they're promoting anorexia right this gets back to that cult these people that want to cultivate an idea around their likeness people that are wanting to be like these individuals in Hollywood then say okay well you know what I'm just not going to eat because I want to look like that and it clearly worked for her she just didn't eat for a few days and it leads to more sad people more sick people in the end again do what you want to do but be willing to tell the truth otherwise you're worse than a cult actually you're exactly what a cult is you are based around extreme ideas that are false and you are operating those ideas under the guidance of the fact that you have become a charismatic leader for so many of these young men and women who don't have a shot in hell because they are following Trends and hashtags on social media alright guys that's all I have to say about that if you want to hear my thoughts on the Christian versus Herschel Walker drama that's playing out on Instagram and across

vibes in the world and as it pertains to our children we have to tether ourselves to that reality and be willing to continually talk about it there's this idea in politics that if you send your kids to a private school they're somehow safer than if you save them send them to a public school and there's some Merit to that in that you may have more power as a parent in a private school because when it's funded privately and you say we're not going to pay for this they the school tends to respond to that more quickly versus a public school they're like ah we've got the government on our side and so we don't really care if parents are upset about it right well I just want to let you know that doesn't mean that terrible things not happen in private schools an elite private school in Chicago recently had the dean of students caught on camera bragging about bringing in lgbtq plus Health Center to teach queer sex to minors and this was exposed by project Veritas they are amazing I absolutely love James O'Keefe we kind of came up in politics together when he was just sort of getting started and doing a lot of events together he's a wonderful person who is doing incredible work real journalism which is such a rarity today they had someone undercover talking to this Dean and here is what that man had to say on camera I had like our lgbtq plus Health Center come in they were passing around butt plugs and dildos to my students talking about queer sex using blue versus using spit meet Joe Bruno dean of students at the prestigious branches W Parker private school in Chicago which happens to charge forty thousand dollars per student they're just like passing on dildos butt gloves the kids are just playing with them they're like how do you how does this work how do I do like how does this work that's a really like blue part of my job so the there you have it he is passing out butt plugs to minors 14 year olds watching them play with it talking to them about Lube whether you should spit or whether you should use a lube and he enjoys his job his nails by the way if you're not watching that video and you're listening his nails are painted so we know what side of the coin he sits on lgbtqia alphabet soup Pride which I keep telling people is just perversion it's it's all a perversion this isn't about love is love this is about something much more demented and their focus on children should terrify you this is happening at a private school an elite private school in Chicago people are spending tens of thousands of dollars per year to send their children to pass around butt plugs I can't even it doesn't I can't even fathom a course like this at my I went to public school I could not fathom this but the world has changed so much since I was in high school and I want to give you an update because the school which is now obviously been under a ton of scrutiny for this a lot of public scrutiny has come out with a statement and if you're thinking oh Candice they're going to say that they condemn this you haven't been alive in 2022 in Chicago and any of these woke cities instead the principal of the school Dan Frank wrote this letter dear Parker Community we are writing to let you know that one of our employees while at a conference last week was targeted by a right-wing Fringe group of individuals that seeks to undermine and manipulate diversity Equity inclusion and belonging work in schools this evening the group showed up outside the school and attempted to confront an ambitious employee with aggressive questions a handful of students and family members were present this incident is very upsetting and we stand in full support of our employee we have put additional security measures in place and we will notify the community should there be any additional activity from this group regarding the school of our employee we advise members of our community not to engage with any organization that fits this General profile respectfully Dan Frank principal also a freak yeah that's it he's also a freak so if you're wondering how bad it is at that school the principal is not shocked by this he thinks that that's part of diversity and equity and inclusion to pass butt plugs around to your students when they're 14 years old and talk to them about whether they use Lube or they spit that is he's saying that is the aim of this program and he's not lying by the way I stand with Dan Frank on that conclusion that that is the aim of the lgbtqia plus alphabet community they are trying to prime your children and we've talked about this this is what we're talking about we say they are groomers right what person outside of a groomer would watch a teacher at their school say that on camera with painted nails and not go hmm we're getting something wrong here right we may actually be having a bunch of predators that are near children because that's what is happening these are not teachers of anything these are predators who get off on talking to your children about topics that should be reserved for the home and should be reserved for adults quite frankly that's my personal opinion on it so just wanted to give you that story how on Earth did time go by this fast we'd even get to the Daily comment Roundup it's okay because I'm going to take it behind the paywall you guys have tons of comments a lot of interesting ones I also I'm going to read somebody's comment regarding when a woman should call the police on a man and some of your questions I love answering your questions one of you guys is asking

about you know this is like 1930s Germany I mean look at this of what is going on in the Netherlands in Amsterdam the police beating people looking at what their crime is you would think these people were were targeting yeah first and foremost they announced that they're going to give people up to six doses of the coveted vaccine um they're trying to mandate that right now in the Netherlands and so you have people obviously that are protesting Us in the street and this is the response to the protesting [Applause] look at him just hit that woman it's incredible he just hits that woman standing there and just so you understand what these people's crime is they're not they don't have weapons it's not a BLM protest they're not burning anything down they're just not allowed to protest it is illegal to protest so they send the police out they send the dogs out and they beat people that are gathering if you don't think this can happen in America you're out of your mind they want this everywhere this has been a plot for a long time they want authoritarian Rule and it is insane to see this I mean it's it's already happening in New York I think people are realizing that first of all here in the United States we're blessed you know we have freedom some Freedom left at least you know Freedom isn't given by government or one man it's given by God and what we're seeing right now is many people that are fighting against this massive I think push for a global control and they don't want it and so the media will not show you this you see a lot of these videos on social media but the mainstream media is hiding this information because they don't want others to wake up and realize you are more powerful than your government your government cannot tell you what to do you have a right to protect your family protect your freedoms and to decide what's best for your body not the government we'll get right back to the show in just a minute but first I wanted to take a moment to

American farmers and as we're seeing the government really try to step in you're also seeing this this push for them to be viewed as the parents like you're they want parents out of the picture fully and while you're seeing these teachers that are like vaccinating children behind the parents back and all these weird stories that are popping up and I can't think of anything more odd than this White House covid vaccine promo video that came out for kids it's just it's so dystopian we should watch a clip of it is it safer to put up my friends if I'm vaccinated you know what it is and it's so important to play with your friends right parents and your teachers have been doing lots of things to keep you guys safe and this will make it a little bit safer I'm excited to play for with my friend Dorothy and my other friends at school because they said when we all get vaccinated we can have a playdate I think I want to go on vacation go on vacation we do anywhere special you want to go on vacation back to Atlanta oh yeah I remember that it's gonna be fun to be doing all those fun things again isn't it why did grown-ups get it first and how did they get her first so the reason is is that whenever we have any vaccines or medicines too we want to make sure first that it works in adults and then once we know it's safe in adults then we feel a little more comfortable knowing that it's going to be safe in kids why do we get the vaccine in a shot instead of drinking it you know part of the reason that we get the vaccine in a shot instead of drinking it is because all those little things in our body that that are like our coach they are in the part of our body that we can get through actually through our muscle as opposed to through our mouth and through drinking it cool what do you think about getting the covid vaccine a little nervous I'm nervous yeah I'm excited and you're excited I was a little nervous and a little excited when I got my first one too and I'm really glad I got it have you gotten your first dose yet are you gonna are you gonna get it soon okay I'm getting mine on the 15. I have a question why are you speaking to my child when I am not present about any of this yes this is the conversation that should take place between parents and children there was no medical decision that a parent should not be present for that is being made exactly thanks for joining me on this segment of Candace if you'd like to join the daily wires fight against the Biden administration's unconstitutional vaccine mandates head to dailywire.com do not comply and sign our petition today", "kK1cUuQ5NqQ": "somebody that was able to speak whose voice I don't know if I've ever heard I think maybe just in the Oprah interview before his wife spoke over him but Prince Harry spoke yesterday and it does it feels like a rare act he just has let Meghan Markle do all the Talking she's now had a podcast it's like she is his PR agent and she tells you why his family sucks and she does it like every month and then she also tells you that the only reason they left was because they wanted their privacy and so they moved into Hollywood which is not the not the area that I would recommend the neighborhood that I would recommend if you want your privacy I also wouldn't recommend having a podcast if you want your privacy but Prince Harry has actually spoke he spoke to the winners of the 2022 well child Awards which is a charity that celebrates the inspirational quality of the UK's seriously ill children along with those who go that extra mile to make a difference to their lives here is Prince Harry I'll tell you what we all need a we only need a dog that keeps us calm I've got I've got three in this house now so we basically have five children um I've got a black labrador called uh Pula a rescue beagle called guy and we got another rescue beagle called uh Mia um and between the three of them um they charge around chasing squirrels and causing all sorts of problems to us every single day yeah they are but they are also emotional emotional support dogs 100 I mean I'm you know one of my biggest pet peeves is emotional support dogs but I think he's he just comes across as likable and I don't know how it's possible that he's so likable and Megan is just seems to be the exact opposite which brings me to her podcast she recently released a new episode where she says that she's been labeled as crazy and hysterical and nuts and insane although she doesn't actually say who said that and she also says that she feels pretty strongly about the word crazy and that families have been Shattered by its use take a listen I'm Megan and this is archetypes my podcast about the labels and tropes that try to hold women back I feel pretty strongly about this word this label crazy that it's thrown around so casually and the Damage it's brought on society and women frankly everywhere from relationships to families being shattered reputations destroyed and careers ruined stigma surrounding the word if it also has this silencing effect this effect where women experiencing real mental health issues they get scared they stay quiet they internalize and they repress for far too long there's a lot to unpack here so she says stigma around the word crazy has a silencing effect I challenge that notion because clearly she says that she's been called crazy and she's definitely not been silent at all despite what she would have you believe she keeps pretending that she's being in prison and nobody's allowing her to speak I just want to say also in general this sounds like the worst podcast ever I just don't understand people that think leaning into this victim mentality is something that people want to hear especially nowadays it's just it's it's just old it's just aged nobody wants to hear how oppressed you are as a princess it just doesn't make any sense and I do think actually I read a really interesting piece in the Daily Mail where they talked about this weird environment or this weird place that Harry and Megan are in now because they don't really know how to make money right their entire brand is talking about their own victimhood and they've kind of signed a deal with the devil they've agreed to Spotify you know I think that the deal was something like 25 million dollars and they agreed to this deal thinking that they were going to do something productive and healthy but in reality what Spotify wants is blood they want them to continue to trash the royal family and they seem a little less willing to do that now especially following Queen Elizabeth II's death they don't seem like they want to give that but they have no other use in society Megan was never a great actress nobody knew who she was before she got with Prince Harry which granted her access to the parties that she wanted Grant granted her access to the billionaires that she wants to be around like Oprah but how is she going to make her money Oprah's talented Oprah is a had was an incredible talk show host she owns a network she's very good when she gives these interviews she knows how to get people to give her the information that she wants what is the talent that Harry and Megan have because I don't care how far left you are I don't care how anti-family you are or how much you despise the nuclear family or the concept of a royal family that isn't actually by the way have any real power they're not an absolute monarch over in the UK despite the depictions that Megan and Harry have given to society no matter how far left you are you just become a little bit uncomfortable when somebody's entire brand and the only way that they make money is by denigrating their family they're going to have to come up with a new plan moving on I want to talk about this Planned Parenthood cartoon ad yup Planned Parenthood is under Fire not because they've aborted millions and millions of babies and have ripped them a limb from limb from their mother's womb no they've never been under Fire for that but they're under Fire for a cartoon ad that teaches teenagers different ways of delaying their puberty some of which they say works like a stop sign you can just stop your puberty one of the ways is through the use of puberty blockers which can halt voice deepening facial hair growth and menstrual cycles the organization posted the video to its YouTube account in January but it's recently resurfaced on The Eye Inside the classroom Twitter account take a listen there's no one-size-fits-all puberty experience if your trans intersex or non-binary know that you're not the only one feeling confused for some intersex people puberty may start later than age 14. you might experience some of puberty's changes and not others and your body may or may not go through puberty on its own there are medicines you can take to help your body start the process like hormone replacement therapy some people decide on hormones or surgeries to help their bodies match up to their gender identity or how they feel inside about themselves your gender identity is real you should be the one to decide what changes you want to make to your body if you're transgender or non-binary you may find that your puberty experiences don't line up with your gender identity or how you see yourself that feeling can be uncomfortable scary and stressful if that sounds like you know that you're not alone there are medicines you can take to delay puberty for a while they're called puberty blockers and they work like a stop sign by halting the hormones testosterone and estrogen that cause puberty changes like facial hair growth and periods puberty blockers are safe and can give you more time to figure out what feels right for you your body and your gender identity you don't have to have all of the answers right now so remember it's all a work in progress and it may take time to figure out what feels right to you but talking to a trusted adult and a nurse or doctor may help want to learn more go to plannedparenthood.org teens it's just positively despicable I mean there is no question that Planned Parenthood is a death cult it is they are they are a deaf organization they specialize in death that's what they do they tell people that they shouldn't have families they abort children from the womb of their mothers I just can't imagine that this organization is still being funded by people and now they are turning their attention to teenagers and trying to get them to destroy their bodies so that they can never become reproductive human beings that's the game right actually we won't even have to perform an abortion on you because you're not going to be able to become pregnant you are you're going to be rendered infertile how brilliant is that for Planned Parenthood to realize right because now that conservatives are once again winning on the pro-life organic pro-life movement which by the way is sad that we had to win on a movement that supports life that supports families that supports birth now that we have finally won that argument and sent that argument back down to the States we voted on again they're going what can we do what can we do and their answer is to make sure that human beings just can't procreate Target the teenagers Target them and say oh you can just stop your puberty don't worry by the way we're not going to tell you that these uh hormone therapy and these puberty blockers are actually used to castrate pedophiles in prison we're not going to tell you that we're not going to tell you that if you're a male and you take these for a long time they're going to develop a micro penis and you are actually not going to have any sexual desire you take this for long enough you're not even going to be able to have productive sexual relationships when you become an adult you're actually probably going to fall into a deep deep depression when you realize this when you realize that adults lied to you when you realize that doctors lie to you when you realize that you were intentionally confused intentionally targeted by an entire ecosystem of evil an ecosystem that is happening in the classrooms and ecosystem that is happening on social media where they permit these lies to be told and spread around the world and an ecosystem that ends up really in a hospital room when children are confused about why their bodies don't work the way that they're supposed to because they were given Credence to an idea that is a lie no you cannot pick your gender no you cannot halt your puberty like a stop sign these are incredibly Sinister organizations and people that support this and I'm glad that Planned Parenthood is having their day in the public courtroom and people are starting to realize what this organization has always been about which is death all right

I want to look like I'm pretty crying all the time as opposed to the miserable crying that I usually do lol", "EeZs_xbTXrM": "but first a breaking news story obviously you have probably seen that i am currently engaged in a tweef also known as a twitter beef with no one other than cardi b so here to unpack all of this drama with me i have the alleged harvard graduate definitive hip hop expert and cardi b historian ben shapiro let's also give it up for comedian nicole arbour and former police officer and author of be in black and blue my good friend brandon tatum i am going to start with you nicole ladies first okay so cnn ran with the headline that this was a sex positive performance so obviously women watching this should be inspired because this is sex positive so i want to ask you nicole yes how you were inspired by this sex positivity it feels like herpes positive and chlamydia positive i was inspired to get an std test but also get up stack of ones i'm not going to lie to you no that i i don't feel like this is a positive portrayal of women this is the same issue we've seen for so many years and i think positivity for women would be going the other way be hot be sexy but be something else too that's what we should be selling so just to quickly recap the way that the feud started with me and cardi was that she saw a clip of me on tucker carlson he picked the topic obviously and asked me to similarly respond and i i said that this um to me felt like a corrosion of culture which is something that we talk about often uh brandon and particularly in black america we talk about culture so i'm gonna try to put you on the spot to defend cardi so i said it was a corrosion of culture can you spin this for me and tell me how actually no this is the opposite this is us uplifting uh culture and black america that's very difficult to do um i think if you want to ruin a culture if you like nasty women and you don't want your children to grow up and get married and be successful this would probably be a good idea for you to have and have them watch it but cardi b is that was nasty it was disgusting not only visual visibly but it's disgusting to the growth in the in the production of the the black community um in communities anywhere you know you can't you can't go around flunting your stuff with a fake booty and claiming you got the when your husband cheating on you and leaving you i guess the whopping i guess it ain't wiping that girl i don't get into that but yeah i mean we can't get into that because me and her apparently got into absolutely everything on twitter so we will definitely go there but first i think we need to have bench apparel live read one of cardi b's tweets he is a cardi b historian as you guys know so let's pull up one of the tweets that cardi sent my way um ben i am cardi b ib matter of fact i'm just going to thank candy she put my performance on fox news giving it more views that boosted the views on youtube and is counting towards my streams and sales emoji capitals stream up and whap period after space remember grown parents only you can monitor what your kids watch no one else period uh as our local hip-hop expert can you please interpret what cardi b means uh and and uh can you also explain to us how this individual was selected to be uh the person to interview then presidential candidate joe biden i mean her shakespearean brilliance is on full display in this tweet the proper grammar the incredible spelling the use of the emoji which you remember from king lear and the and the just incredible verbal play in which she engages it truly is awe inspiring and all i can say is that a culture that can produce cardi b as its high art that culture is going places and i i couldn't agree with you more and you know ben you and i actually discussed something on your show uh that i think is so relevant here we talked about the gaslighting that the left tends to do to conservatives and could you just explain that for viewers because it's so correct so there's this game that folks in the media on the left they love to play this game where they will do something that is extraordinarily edgy or ridiculous or insane and then if you notice this thing they say why are you even looking at that why are you even watching that and it's sort of like the barista who you know it has the green hair and the and the rings all over their face like in their eyelid and then you look at them like what are you looking at you right because you decided to make yourself look like this because you wanted attention cardi b was looking for attention you gave her attention but you weren't supposed to give her attention right the only sort of attention she's supposed to receive is plotted for the brilliance of her of her words and the incredible genius of her feminism which is absolutely indistinguishable as far as i can tell from pretty much every sophomore pornography film from like 1987. i've seen them all you're right yeah i mean thanks for joining me on this segment of candace a special thanks to cardi who i know is watching and listening because she watches and listens to everything i say if you liked this

just amazing president made a hole in one 180 yard five iron even greater than this though is the fact that he decided to release a statement regarding this i mean this is what makes you miss donald trump right the statement by donald j trump begins with many people are asking so i'll give it to you now it is 100 percent true yes while playing with the legendary golfer ernie ells winner of four majors and approximately 72 of the tournaments throughout the world um gene sauer is winner of the senior us open he names goes on to list them he hit a hole in one is what he wants to know the best is the end of this i won't tell you who won because i am a very modest individual and you will then say i was bragging i don't like people who brag i love him exclamation mark how do you not miss this like this is hilarious like issuing a statement about like winning one yeah i'm not gonna tell you who won though i'm not a bragger but i'm gonna brag about the fact that i made a hole in one against a legendary legendary golfer like that's the person that we missed in office and of course if he was in office they would be scrambling going this shows his mental instability why would he ever issue this statement his narcissism you know this is funny it's hilarious let me tell you i live in palm beach so i live near mar-a-lago and i hosted a charity event a few weeks ago and he came in forget the beatles you guys okay no one cares it was like a trap and there were 800 people in this room he greeted everyone he had such stamina and energy something personal to every person that came off afterwards and said he said this to me we talked about this he took a selfie he shook my hand he was in there for two hours and gave a speech off the cuff you know who couldn't do that joe biden right he only reads teleprompters my main takeaway from that magnificent extended tweet from trump these press releases that are religious tweets is not just the humor it's obviously very very funny it's the self-control right this is a guy who's he's actually not falling into some narcissistic bragging he's making a joke about bragging right he's doing it even that little wink there at the end and i think we're living in a world right now where will smith loses total control of his emotions he smacks chris rock across the face where joe biden loses complete control over his train of thought over his geopolitical strategy over his bladder over his words i'd say we've heard the vatican story he even you know in mid-sentence joe biden will become really really angry and he'll yell and then he'll kind of bring it back and he's obviously not in control donald trump for all of his flaws the man had self-control he was always kind of laughing he was always playing out his little game and i think that we miss that in this country and if we had a little more self-control we wouldn't be at the whims of crazy oil markets record inflation war in europe i mean this empty shelves that's right this is what happens when you can't control yourself when you can't govern yourself right that's that's that's absolutely correct and i think like i've said in previous episodes that that has been the silver lining in having a biden presidency is that people are starting to realize that we were in the middle of a media war before when trump was in office and they made you think that every day was it was going to be the last of his country but actually it was an incredible period of peace and now you're seeing what it looks like when the media you know tries to say nothing about what's going on but actually everything is falling apart around you and your livelihoods are being impacted so hopefully that will be a wake-up call going in to midterms what's on your spring cleaning list if you're

that I do not want to comment on because I don't know how to comment on it I really I don't know I have almost nothing left to say about Christian Teigen I thought we put her in a box and we sent her off and that really she should have had her social media accounts taken from her after we uh unpacked her extensive need to tell teenagers to kill themselves Chrissy Teigen you can't talk about a death call without breaking up Chrissy Teigen uh she loves suicide preferably telling people that they should be committing suicide and still has never apologized to any of those then teenagers involved because why should she have to she's Chrissy Teigen she's the wife of John Legend she's a Hollywood a-lister you can sort of see now that the public is trying to her PR team must be great they're trying to reintroduce us and make us forget that she's a total psychopath she is actually a psychopath um and they uh for whatever reason feel compelled to keep themselves in the media politically by just making extreme comments right so Chrissy Teigen if you did not know and I'm going to say this now because the time it felt inappropriate obviously she suffered a miscarriage uh it was I think about a year ago I could be wrong and we know that she suffered a miscarriage because they posted videos they named the son jack she was in the hospital they were trying to rescue his life and eventually she had a miscarriage according to Chrissy Teigen right she posted these extraordinary photos and I do want to show you some of these photos because at the time despite the fact that as a mother you felt so bad if you were like me I saw these photos and I said you know what it's a little weird that these photos were taken I'm going to be honest I know that you guys felt that way she took these you know photos in the hospital right after having lost her son of her crying of her praying of her and John Legend um sitting let's take a look at some of these photos here's one uh as just one example she is yeah sitting on the bed in the hospital and she's crying it's a very sad photo but it begs the question who took the photo right like who actually after they lose their child who would be so invasive as to take their phone out or take a camera out and photograph a woman in this you know horrible position this very sad position but then there's another photo here's another one of her and John Legend and he goes okay if John Legend didn't take that photo of her initially who was the third person that was in this Hospital during the time of covet lockdowns by the way when people were not even allowed to have their husbands in there when they were giving birth who could be so invasive as take a photo of the both of them in this moment this very vulnerable moment right we were all thinking it at the time but again this was a topic regarding miscarriage who just went whatever I I personally think Chrissy Teigen is addicted to social media she's addicted to getting attention and I thought that this was evidence of that and I also felt and I'm gonna say it now because it feels like it's okay to say it now that it was a PR strategy right if there was a firestorm about how disgusting and horrible of a person that she had been online to so many people and then suddenly she pops up she's pregnant and then she loses her child and rather than announcing that they lost their child uh they put these very graphic photos on the internet and once again the Press then says oh forget all the suicide stuff that she she's so brave look at her she's photographing herself going through a miscarriage we love her again right wrong okay this is what I was thinking during the time I didn't say it but recently Chrissy Teigen I guess who just cannot get enough social media decided that she wanted to unearth that scenario and get more attention from it from it right so she initially said it was a miscarriage she now says that the loss of her son jack was the result of a life-saving termination actually wasn't a miscarriage she said he had no chance of survival so that they opted into getting an abortion I'm sorry what are you are you kidding you you can just update that so so you had the entire world mourning with you you released these photos to the public and you said I had a miscarriage of you crying in a hospital right and the world came to your AIDS and we're so sorry you're so brave for posting these photos but now you find it to be politically expedient to see that it was an abortion instead here's the quote she gave she actually said this quote let's just call it what it was it was an abortion an abortion to save my life for a baby that had absolutely no chance she also said that it was because of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade that prompted her to reconsider how she spoke about her experience after telling her husband John Legend that she sympathized with people who have had an abortion he helped her to understand that her own experience was actually an abortion oh okay so you just decided to reconsider a miscarriage and to categorize it as an abortion you sat down and said oh how can we get more attention because taking photos of ourselves going through this thing that should be incredibly personal between you and your husband having some third-party person capture it and then quickly putting it on Instagram for likes and then having your PR agent gets you a bunch of applauds throughout the media Applause oh she's so brave so it wasn't enough right now everyone's arguing about abortion you think you can insert yourself into this because you're a sick mentally ill individual okay Chrissy Teigen is mentally ill there is no question about this right if you want to talk about what social media causes the issues that it causes the mental illness that it causes we should be examining Chrissy Teigen as a prime example okay a prime example the fact that you would use a dead child for attention not once but twice right you just said oh it's evolved I'm gonna actually metamorphosize this thing that happened to me I'm going to metamorphosize first it was a miscarriage you felt bad for me but wouldn't you now think I'm so brave if I then said my miscarriage was instead an abortion this is what's going on in her sick twisted demented little head and she does it oh I after seeing what the Supreme Court said I realized that my miscarriage was actually an abortion aren't I brave for doing that no Chrissy you're a disturbed individual and you should have your account taken away from you right you should have had your accounts taken away from me we were telling children to kill themselves but now you literally need to put your phone down Chrissy Teigen where she should exist is in college textbooks psychology classes right when we look back on this era of social media and we talk about the various mental illnesses it has caused people we should be able to open a textbook and read about the case of Chrissy Teigen and the John Legend that wouldn't stop her that's all I have to say about that next up let's talk about Stacy Abrams because when we talk about the cult of death of course we have the politicians that are trying to sell you that death is actually compassionate and here is what Stacy Abrams had to say about abortion on The View do you think there should be any legal limits on abortion such as the third trimester or viability I believe that abortion is a medical decision not a political decision thank you and arbitrary arbitrary arbitrary politically defined timelines are deeply problematic because they ignore the reality of medical and physiological issues for example a six-week ban tells women they have to make reproductive choices before they know they're pregnant okay so uh politically Define timelines are arbitrary that's what she says right and then she proceeds to tell you about at six how at six weeks women don't know they're pregnant that's literally something that would be a politically defined timeline I knew I was pregnant both times before six weeks they're just saying that just something to say right now they just all decided to agree and lockstep that women don't know they're pregnant in six weeks that's a completely made up thing and somehow this six-week Mirage that they have made up has now transformed into a reason why at nine months people should still be able to abort their child this should of course be considered child sacrifice that's what it is this should be considered in the same context of what the Aztecs did when they would sacrifice children while they built temples because that's what it is you're just sacrificing children but guys it's compassionate don't you understand don't you feel compassion for Stacy Abrams don't you feel compassion for the women that are choosing to abort their children at nine months in the womb don't you feel compassion for Chrissy Teigen who had a miscarriage and then magically transformed it into an abortion don't you aren't you aren't we all just feeling a little bit compassionate what about the fat people are you feeling compassionate for them they never get to see themselves on the screen they they turn on their TVs and they don't get to just see other people that are 400 pounds and 300 pounds in clinically obese and huffing and puffing going up the stairs they don't feel compassion for them that's sad we need to show more of that on television or we could acknowledge the truth which is that it's a cult of death all right

talking about this whole Kyrie Irving situation and why we both felt so impacted by it so I want to say that I think he is emblematic of some of the great things that I want to see changed about Black Culture he's fun he's positive he is not promoting gun violence in any way he's always been the nice guy he believes in family at the very least yes he's got tons of baby mamas but he also has tons of kids and according to his most recent baby mama who he has had I think three of the children with maybe two I could be wrong she says that he's a great father that has been the feedback bizarrely he doesn't have any bitter baby mamas and I'm not conduring the behavior I don't think that you should have however big mom as he has I don't think it's great I think you should aspire to have all the children on the same house and I question how he could possibly be so present for all of them but I will say is that they seem to really love him and respect him and I think that we should just try to recognize that people are not all good and all perfect but I do think that Nick Cannon is mostly a good addition to our culture", "o0ZYr3sp9M4": "busy oh Sean yes please that is yours no I I feel

laughing at the muppet babies remember that remember the muppet babies you grew up with and maybe you could leave your kids washing them up with babies yeah no longer let's just watch what the muppet babies is promoting today we met the most amazing princess but they ran away and all they left behind was this everyone there's something i need to tell you the princess who came to your ball tonight was me [Music] because you all expected me to look a certain way i don't want you to be upset with me i am upset with you gonzo i am upset with you this is just i mean i look at this and we talk about it all the time we talk about this nobody listen the kids are definitely being attacked this kind of a messaging if i was sitting here thinking that my child was watching something that was for children and looked around and saw them promoting the transgender like i would go absolutely mad and you realize they know that children's brains are developing they want to know it's an option kids are monkey c monkey do so this to me is a direct attack on children this is predatorial in my opinion 100 it's child abuse and i can tell you from the hollywood perspective having been a director producer in hollywood these people hate us they hate us so much that's why what you're doing and what daily wire is doing is so important because for too long conservatives have not understood the importance of messaging this way to our society in total including children the left understands it it's why you can't go to a movie now with your child without seeing some sort of left messaging in the latest scooby-doo movie they give references to ruth bader ginsburg as a hero of women's rights multiple times dress up as her for halloween then they pitch tinder to the kids and bash on masculinity they do these things on purpose to shift the window over to acceptable thought only being on their side we have to do the same thing so that's why we've got to keep doing the stuff you're doing and continue expanding it into every avenue yeah well and we have to keep just standing up for truth because this is all about our children and the next generation and we've seen how as robbie said entertainment is always about targeting children and to normalize evil and for all of the culture and the the left that says we have to tolerate everything no we don't we don't have to tolerate evil and we can stand up and say you know what judgment discernment those words used to actually mean something having good judgment and and being a discerning person and i am going to judge that i'm going to say that that's evil i'm going to say that that's wrong that's anti-biblical and stand up for the truth with courage and if people call you names who cares this is all about making sure that we keep the truth of the moral parameters for our society and for our kids and of course the idea here is also to undermine parents right to say like your parents if they don't agree with this messaging then they're bigoted to get children get them into the school systems kind of say this is the new thought process your parents are old school doesn't make sense all right guys in the age of

document that they're reading if you understand exactly what they're learning it's no longer safe when they're pretending that gender doesn't matter and you can wake up one day and you can be cinderella right you can be cinderella you can be a woman and we're seeing now kids increasingly making that decision i see making that decision because statistics defy reality right it's we didn't just go from like one trans person chaz bono and a whole documentary because it was so extraordinary to now one in six kids is thinking that they're non-binary this war didn't exist when we were growing up the non-binary doesn't exist there are children learning that there's 26 27 28 40 infamous you know an infinite amount of genders and this is scary because men if we don't have a society that believes in masculinity that believes in gender difference you're just going to see that the disappearance of manhood means that a society can't can't survive you can't survive with a bunch of men walking around in dresses unsure of which bathroom to go into right absolutely and you also have to make sure that femininity survives in culture and traditional marriage and the traditional family unit and what's so scary about this is that we're seeing judges actually go to children and say your feelings matter more than your biology and to say that your feelings matter over facts and to say that children can make these life-altering decisions for themselves over and above their parents wishes parental rights under our constitution and under a system of just sanity says that parents are responsible for the health safety and welfare of their children and they're the ones that absolutely have to protect their children not be at the will and the mercy of a six-year-old who says i came home and i'm confused one day because you know susie gave me some nail polish and i think i'm a girl you can say no tommy you are a boy and here's why and actually put those parameters in place and so when we have government that's wanting to step in and say i'm the parent that's where we get a lot of off-course legal rulings and that's where canada has been the united states absolutely needs to have a firm line on that and you're exactly right that this is tied into education period this is why we just saw a fourth grader this week go up to a school board and say my teacher told me to do this equity survey and not to tell my parents it made me uncomfortable it made the whole class uncomfortable that's why this week a harvard professor went on tv and had the gall to say that sex is defined by science by biology and that there are males and females and then the school diversity and inclusion officer went out and bashed her on social media this stuff is all tied together because at its premise you can't replace a generation of voters unless you remove their parents authority and that's what they want to do and the fact that it takes like a guy with a man bun is standing up saying we need masculinity okay that should tell everybody something that at this point in time i'm considered like a very masculine person that should tell people something we need

abortion rights just what has happened what has transcended in the last 24 hours well i think i think some of the way the reporting is going on this that people have actually got the wrong impression some people think that the vote has already taken place and the ruling has already come down not the case right the ruling is expected to come down two months from now but we've got a leak now into politico of a draft ruling that's been written yet not signed off on by justice alito and we're told in concurrence with five total justices which would be enough to overturn roe v wade however comma it has not yet been released what does this mean i don't think this was a leak i think this was an operation they are trying to shut this thing down in its tracks they are trying to put pressure and use public opinion to use political forces to put pressure on the court to keep roe v wade you have someone in there a group of political actors and conspirators that are trying to stop this and i think quite frankly that they should be treated like i don't know people who were trying to maybe stop the counting of electoral votes i mean it seems to me like stopping a government institution for conducting its business is an insurrection so find the people who did this lock them up and put them right next to the january 6 detainees yeah i mean i i totally agree i just can't imagine a circumstance where this country gets into a worst state like this is the this is the supreme court we're talking about this stuff just just does not happen at this level it's ridiculous to look at this and go all they're doing right now is saying violence we want a bunch of people outside that are threatening the lives of supreme court justices and saying that if this goes through we're going to burn the place down i mean we're actually seeing people tweet this right oh this is the best way to burn down the supreme court last last night they were already there you're going to see you're going to see the activists and then you're going to see the forefront of antifa they are trying to get the same forces that were mobilized in the blm antifa riots of 2020 to re-mobilize in opposition to this court they've barricaded now the auspices of the supreme court itself the facility the justices are requesting higher protection from u.s marshals and members of the doj this situation is rapidly deteriorating getting completely out of control we'll get back to the show in just a moment but first i want to tell you about legacy box we all have those old photos that we have that are

role in the pro-life movement but this has been a 50-year movement with millions and millions of americans behind it and this is the culmination the only thing that i am surprised about is that people are surprised that that someone would leak this document these people kill babies i sometimes think we we ourselves in the pro-life movement don't realize the enormity of this these are people who are willing to kill babies yeah they're going to leak a document yeah they're going to do whatever they can to try to gum up this process so right now it seems that there is a a 5-4 vote two overturned roe versus wade and overturn planned parenthood vkc but anything could happen and so the question now is when will the court release it will they as you say wait until the summer and remain on their schedule i say drop it now they got to drop it now issue the ruling immediately get ahead of all this don't even let this process take place put the thing out put your names on because if they don't michael if they don't then they will show that our court system is broken that the credibility of that institution is malleable by political forces and that is not the purpose of the supreme court right it really comes down to i agree it all comes down to chief justice roberts at the end of the day i think because he was the one who was all about let's not make the court partisan let's let's keep the institutionalist protected it's really the question is will he be a coward or will he do what you're saying which is to put it out there but look i haven't seen democrats this upset basically since republicans freed the slaves uh the fact that we have this like you said this this uh you know generations of of slaughter 62 million children and we can just think about that these lives that have been slaughtered uh margaret singer is also rolling in her grave because her her dream of aborting and taking the lives of black children it could be stymied at this moment so i hope that justice roberts will grow a pair considering his track record i'm not sure that's the case but let's pray for him thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this

Tuesday question of the day I want you to think about it are you a political sadist yeah think about that plus I have to come to Matt Walsh's defense yet again can you believe that this time it's

pleasure or the tendency to derive pleasure from cruelty you know that a lot of times it has sexual connotations as well but here's my idea I think that what was once a fetish has now become commonplace in American politics so I'll tell you why I began thinking about this topic I think the first time I thought about it was in regards to the bizarre treatment of Ivanka Trump throughout president Donald Trump's entire four years in office I mean people were obsessed right with trying to get her to say something awful about her father and why is that strange because the entire world condemned Trump the entire world at every second of the day there was never a single second or a breather or we did not have headlines telling us how awful this man was right but that wasn't enough that the entire Legacy Media claimed that he was a racist nope it was not enough that they claimed that he was a sexist it wasn't enough that all of the celebrities and all of the left-leaning politicians even right-leading politicians Mitt Romney and Co said that he was this awful person a misogynist they called him a bigot they called him a homophobe they called him a transpho I even remember and you guys will recall when they said that Trump was incestuous right they had pulled together all these clips of him talking throughout the years about how wonderful and how much he loved Ivanka and they said oh this man is incestuous it was sick that they would even imply that they called him a rapist at one point but as I said it wasn't enough that this was the mainstreamed opinion about him they also needed for Ivanka Trump to say the same things there was all of this mounting peer pressure and it was completely nonsensical and it reached a fever pitch when they came up with the storyline that children remember this children are living in cages at the border how could Trump's Administration do this remember the famous picture of AOC at the wall wearing all white the everyone she was with was wearing all white and she had red lipstick and she went down to the border and she didn't see a single child in a cage that didn't matter she cared so much about the issue that she went down and staged a photo op and people were completely incensed oh my gosh how could this be happening it's basically slavery all over again I mean I know this time people are breaking into our country but look at these children we must do something and of course the entire mainstream media began echoing that claim and it culminated into a Woman by the name of Samantha B I guess she's a comedian or whatever saying this about Ivanka take a listen after Decades of ignoring the issue Americans are finally paying attention well most of us Ivanka Trump who works at the White House chose to post the second most oblivious tweet we've seen this week you know Ivanka that's a beautiful photo of you and your child but let me just say one mother to another do something about your dad's immigration practices you feckless he listens thank you put on something tight and low cut and tell your father to stop it tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes okay so there's a lot going on there first and foremost if you're listening to this not seeing it Ivanka simply posted a photo of her and her young son and she wrote my love right my heart if you will and they were enraged by this so first and foremost we're telling her that it is not acceptable for her to post her children on the internet how dare she do that when they've picked up another narrative that Trump is harming children at the border even though of course these were Obama policies that Trump inherited and by the way nobody talks about that state at all now that we have this incredible influx of the Border today nobody cares anymore because once again they have a democrat in office and they're in lockstep pretending that the Border issue isn't happening but in this moment it really mattered how could Ivanka possibly do that then Samantha B as you just heard leans into that narrative that there's some incest going on in that family I guess that's a narrative that they care about while Trump is in office even though there was not a single shred of proof that that was true today Biden is an office Ashley Biden has written a diary saying that her sexualization began when her father would take inappropriate showers with her that is a truth that I am telling you Ashley Biden wrote that in her diary she was trying to trace why she has so many issues why she became a sex addict and she goes back to this moment where her father took inappropriate showers with her you're like wow I I it's interesting that I'm hearing this from you Candace because I don't see this anywhere I don't think I don't Samantha Beast certainly didn't cover it I think her show has since been canceled probably because it's not funny it wasn't funny to stand up there and to demand that Ivanka Trump say something about an issue that nobody cared about despite the fact that everyone in the mainstream media had something nasty to say you know what happened Ivanka Trump never took the bait despite mercilessly being assaulted for four plus years she never took the bait I remember actually saying that to her once I said I don't know how you do this I don't know how you remain so calm people are so vicious and so disgusting to you she told me it just wasn't in her nature I think also on a level she understood that what was happening wasn't about condemning Trump right there was plenty of people that were issuing condemnations about Trump but they were really manifesting was a form of political sadism they wanted to watch someone that Trump loved hate him right they wanted to fulfill a fetish they wanted to watch Ivanka hurt her father this is an isolation fetish it wanted Trump to feel alone they wanted to basically single to him everyone hates you including your daughter who you love more than anything we have the power to make that happen right because that's what it's about say that it's about power making somebody else feel small but she never ever ever Ivanka never let them scratch that itch I presume because she's not a masochist I'm also bringing up this topic because it's been happening to me recently it's been happening to me regarding yay artist that's formerly known as Kanye West everyone in the entire world has condemned him when I say the entire world I mean he has the kind of global celebrity that is bigger than Ivanka Trump and president Trump since his Tweets in which he said death Con 3 in regards to Jewish people he has since clarified those tweets nobody cares but every single person it feels like every actor every actress every designer every talk show host every model even his former friends every media Outlet certainly on the planet is Once Upon a Time close friends producers rappers that he's worked with everyone has said something awful about him if that wasn't enough he's also been locked out of his Twitter account and his Instagram accounts Balenciaga you know that subramany loves very much just near and dear to his heart he just walked their show they just took his designs off of the websites he is essentially per Sona nangrada on various platforms but for some reason that isn't enough it's not enough hurt to assign to one person I sought enough payment to give him no one no one cares it's not enough we need more what do we need we need blood how do you get blood you find somebody that's his friend somebody that you know that is in his life and you make them say something awful about him and so it's me now it's a peer pressure campaign to make kennesawan say something bad about yay simply because I'm his friend not because enough bad people aren't saying bad stuff about yet and since I'm not doing it people are angry just like Samantha B was angry when she was talking about Ivanka she was mad she was angry she's just saying things that didn't make sense incest ah how dare you post picture of your child ah she's just angry culminating into her calling her a feckless c word and so what's now happening with that anger where does that land upon in terms of me well yesterday on Twitter a woman actually wrote this to me she wrote listen and learn Jew hater she's talking to me I'm talking about yay she's not talking about yes tweet she is saying to me she's calling me Candace Owens absent a shred of evidence a Jew hater right that's meant to hurt me and why did she say this well I it's the entire tweet conversation started with her tweeting that um George Floyd's family should sue me she'd just sue me for telling the truth about his fentanyl levels they should sue me for telling the truth that despite collecting millions and millions of dollars and never even went to his house to gather his things that they had never been to his house according to the roommates in the four plus years that he lived there they had never met a brother or a daughter or an ex-girlfriend or a baby mama right the roommates called into question his relationship with the family members that were crying on TV because what sort of a family member wouldn't go collect their loved one's belongings they were able to collect all that money why not pay to have his car picked up why not pay to have his stuff removed from his property why not at least go visit where he lived and so because I have entered in that truth she told me that I should be sued and when I said this is ridiculous like you can't sue somebody for defamation for telling the truth truth is an absolute defense against defamation if you understand how the law Works in this country and so she then came back and she called me a Jew hater right so essentially what she is saying is that she's angry and until I come out and condemn yea which is what she went on to say I now have to wear me being a Jew hater that's ridiculous I instantly told her first and foremost that I'm not even going to accept that doesn't make me be quiet when you say words that have no meaning to me right I'm not going to accept that label because you're angry and I also told her the truth which is that when you use words like that against people that don't deserve them you actually harm Jewish people right because it makes people not take those words as seriously when you overuse the word racist when you overuse the word sexist it makes those words lose their value people don't take them seriously anymore talking about all of this today because it made me consider another question which is what is it that perpetuates cancer culture and I think the answer is a fetish it is a need that we have to watch people suffer it is an obsession with with watching people hurt and feel isolated that's wrong and it needs to stop and by the way I'm not a masochist and I won't be taking the bait either that's all I have to say about that all right guys I want to take a second to talk to you about Bond charge formerly called Blue blocks they have rebranded and are now called a bond charge and they're a holistic Wellness brand with a huge reign of products aimed at helping you sleep better perform better have more energy recover faster balance hormones reduce inflammation I think my favorite product from Bond charge is their computer glasses because I'm on my phone a computer a lot during the day reading emails and doing research I used to get really bad headaches from staring at screens all day then I tried their computer glasses and they totally solved my problem of digital eye strain now they're pricier than other brands but I think the investment is 100 worth it and here's why they are made in Optics Laboratories not mass produced in factories they use a science-backed technology that is tested to ensure that they actually work their frames are really beautiful and they've even been featured in GQ and Vogue their glasses come in non-prescription prescription and reading options and they have a wide variety of glasses for every need so go to bondcharge.com Candace and use coupon code Candace to

bring up our folks over at Media Matters you know they watch every minute of daily wire content that they can possibly find and then they take out whatever 10 second or 30 second clip that they can find out of context and they perpetuate it on the internet a lot of times it happens to go trending something that can be rather innocuous but it happens to go trending I I asked the question what's the relationship Media Matters has with Twitter but who knows um I am once again forced to bring my friend Matt Walsh out of cancellation he's being canceled now every other week for various things that he is saying and they presume he is a radical and I believe it is a radical when it comes to Dasani water I'm not gonna lie he thinks it's good so there are a lot of lingering questions there but yesterday after I think about 72 hours of Canada someone's trending suddenly Matt Walsh began trending and I took a look at this trend and I realized it was about something that he said that we need to discuss about anime take a listen what's your opinion on anime it's really popular amongst teens and young adults I think it's all satanic I have no argument for it I have no argument for why it's satanic it just seems that way to me all anime to me seems weird just like bizarre creepy um and in general I don't think that adults should be whether it's anime or any other kind of cartoon uh with with rare exception adults really shouldn't be watching cartoons in general I would say oh listen I don't know why people were so upset about this um I want to be very clear here at the daily wire we own the science we own the science on anime in the same way the CDC owns the science we own the science um and unless you have something compelling to say or something that you can argue against what he's very clearly said is just that's what he thinks it's it it's over it's satanic this is this should be it's a conclusion now uh we don't want to hear it in fact we'll send to you if you have anything to say against what he said I stand by my friend and my colleague Matt Walsh and his assessment I'm not exactly sure why daily wire is receiving so much pressure about this but Matt Walsh did respond to the pressure uh he tweeted I'm catching some heat because I said that anime is satanic I just want to clarify that yes it will literally lead to demonic possession in upwards of 87 of cases studies show yeah studies show guys I mean that's it he has said that studies show we shouldn't look any deeper uh into whether or not that claim is true through he also went on to tell us even more science behind his claims he says the girl from The Exorcist used anime and then the next thing you know she was crawling around upside down on the ceiling you guys need to learn your history yes you guys do need to learn your history this is a fact it's like I said daily wire owns a science so it feels weird to me that there's been all this backlash I don't know why this is trending and then he also adds this just from a different daily wire study um if this one was actually conducted by me 74 of all serial killers have an anime habit Hitler was also into anime reports suggest um I mean I can't I cannot even possibly understand how that could be debunked we've already told you that multiple studies say this and we are the ones that are running the studies because we are the experts on anime and we know we're the experts in anime because no one else has come forth to say that they are the experts on anime so if you're having a different experience with anime it doesn't matter and that's um that's all I want to say about that moving on to people that are purportedly to be canceled rapper M.I.A remember I talked about her a couple of days ago we all know the all I want to do is right now and take your Malay I think I sound really good so every time I bring her up I'm just gonna do that because it was a Smash Hit but M.I.A has been purportedly canceled at least by GQ because of her very sensible tweets so M.I.A tweeted this she said Alex Jones lying and Pfizer lying are both trending one with penalty other without if you have no critical thinking faculty this is about as crazy as we should get before a nuclear war wipes out the human race so we covered that she said that and what ended up happening is that GQ responded to these tweets by taking Mia which is supposed to I guess have a cover story or be featured in it and they wrote to her and told her that that could no longer happen the email that she received from GQ says hey Amanda sadly I have some bad news in regards to the GQ award in our upcoming photo shoot Mia's current Twitter activity was brought to our attention and due to its controversial nature GQ will have to step back from working with Mia in regards to our GQ men of the Year award sorry for these bad news on a Friday afternoon please let me know when you want to speak about it on the phone best Dom so casual sorry you are not telling the line which is probax everyone in Hollywood must be probax or you cannot participate in Hollywood we will cut you out of the ecosystem how dare you M.I.A say something uh that even if it's true obviously it's true Pfizer was trending because it turns out that they always knew that it wasn't going to make us immune we already covered that but now she is facing consequences as seems to always be the circumstance um if you dare if you ever dare to ordain to think for yourself the idea that she even spoke about critical thinking in her tweet means that she is not a good candidate to stand up in Hollywood right you're not supposed to think critically when you're in Hollywood you are told what to think and you or your job as somebody in Hollywood is to sell it to the masses so you know what I have reached out to Mia because I don't believe in cancel culture as I told you and I have asked her if she would sit down and talk to me a little bit about her ideas these crazy ideas that she's had about the vaccines which we now know are facts I would like to talk to her about her crazy idea to willingly speak out on those facts and I'm very interested in having that discussion with her so ladies and gentlemen women stay tuned moving on to people that are never canceled all you have to do is say that you're a man you think you're a woman and you'll receive Awards you remember a few weeks ago we covered uh this person who bizarrely was it seems almost given a big following by Tick Tock we talked about how they are artificially uh creating popular channels it almost seems that the more perverse you are on Tick Tock the more likely you are to Garner a big following I don't think it's because people are meaning to engage with your content I think it's because China means for people to engage with your content China of course wins the more perverse in American culture becomes because it is the best way to attack us is with cultural Marxism right they're controlling a tick tock app which means that they are controlling the habits of our children as they are on this app and this creature Dylan Mulvaney came out of nowhere I showed you his video of him frolicking it almost seems like it's a joke of him saying I'm a woman and this is how I have decided I'm going to be a woman I'm going to put on a skirt and say that I'm afraid of bugs that was the video that I showed you um maybe it was last week a couple of weeks ago well Ulta Ulta beauty you know like the opposite of Sephora is Ulta recently just loved Dylan Mulvaney so much they decided to launch a podcast called the beauty of which features influential people like Dylan Mulvaney they had him on and they want their perspectives they just want Dylan Mulvaney to talk about his perspective on beauty so here is what he had to say on that podcast which is catching a little bit of backlash take a listen now I know I can find love I know I can still be a performer I know that I can have a family I want to be a mom one day and I absolutely can and that's why the narrative still has a long way to go because when I was grieving boy Dylan I didn't know those things were even accessible to me okay well I get means that all it takes to be a woman and if you're listening to this you're not hearing it he's dressed in a obviously wearing a bright red dress a big big bow in his hair or if he's like a cheerleader and I sing across from him is a gender bending host who similarly looks like a woman but has a beard because that's some other category of the lgbtq rstv community which I stopped learning the letters after the B I just I don't have time for it I actually just do not have time to learn the language uh anymore and so they're basically on this podcast mocking what it means to be a woman as I say now what it is it's become a caricature Right This Is Halloween they are playing Halloween appropriate just a couple of weeks away they're playing Halloween a podcast and both of them are appearing dressed as women and this artists have a female experience get a podcast and say oh I didn't know all this stuff was available to me but then I went on to tick tock and I realized that all the stuff is available to me like it's all I have to do is afraid of bugs that I like big red bows that I love dresses that I'm wearing some stockings so I'm a woman duh and it's amazing I'm having a great time I'm frogging through the woods with friends I'm being called by Ulta beauty and I'm being asked to speak about what it means to be a woman right what it means to be a beautiful woman and I'm sitting across from a man who has a beard and is also in a strange way presenting as a female and we are now going to tell you guys what it's like to be a girl we're talking all things girly as two grown men that have some form of some varying forms of mental illness and that really what their mental illness is attention that's what it is there aren't all these weird categories of things to identify as that just suddenly appear in our society rapidly over the last five years I didn't go to school with any people that thought they were male or thought they were female right we just had gays and lesbians and there were very few of them in my high school class graduating with there these people weren't gender conflicted we didn't have people jumping up saying that they thought that they were animals or men that had beards but wore lipstick and if we saw them we would have assumed that they were troubled that something was going on at home we didn't have any so we couldn't even assume that but now rapidly everybody's got something going on and everyone's being given Awards and podcasts for talking heroically about their experiences their experience they should be talking about is what it's like to need so much attention right how desperate you must be to be so extreme on social media for likes that you dress yourself up like a woman and pretend that that suddenly makes you so that is embarrassing and it needs to stop moving on a story that should shock nobody researchers at Boston University's national emerging infectious diseases Laboratories have created a new strain of the covid virus echoing experiments which many believe led to the covid-19 pandemic the variant is a hybrid of the Omicron variant which spread over the winter and the original virus that discovered that was discovered in Wuhan with this hybrid having the ability to kill 80 percent of the mice that researchers infected so 80 percent of the mice died they created this in a laboratory remember that conspiracy theory let me ask a question why on Earth are they creating viruses and labs and why does it seem that every time an enemy of the West says that on a platform they're called a terrorist right remember on the show I talked about how Gaddafi said that in a U.N speech years ago and then we killed him in Libya right uh we had Vladimir Putin who said this I talked about this in the platform in his recent speeches that there were a bunch of Laboratories in Ukraine where they were experimenting with viruses he was called a crazy Looney person and he is now a terrorist and if you talk about anything that he says at all right if you talk about any aspect of what he says you're a terrorist too right political sadism and you're guilty now too and you better come out and condemn him or we're going to create a peer pressure campaign I have a lot of talk about the fact that it just seems weird that people keep saying that this is happening that we this is what we do around the world and now it is literally happening in Boston as a fact this is just no plausibility that we are doing this also maybe in Ukraine or in other parts of the world is that just so crazy and and such so far into conspiracy land well unless they tell us that they're releasing viruses it couldn't possibly be true that's what I'll say unless the CDC who did I mention they own the science okay they own the science so don't even think about science because you don't own it you're not a partial owner so there's no IPO for science right you haven't bought stock in it so what they tell us is true unless they come out and they say that they are creating this viruses these viruses with the intent to spread them then it simply can't be so I'm asking you I'm imploring all of my listeners not to engage in baseless conspiracy theories how about that all right guys jumping into the comment Roundup about yesterday's episode I want to start doing this because I do read your comments I love reading your comments and it also helps me grow sometimes you guys tell me Candace you're wrong girl shut up and I listen so if this comment is from Kenyan gray he and it was in response to the episode yesterday which is about nuclear war he said question can you really prepare for a nuclear war if you don't get killed from a blast or radiation there won't be much left of civilization when I was a kid we used to practice in school when an air raid alarm went off in school we'd go out in the hallway and get as close to the wall as possible that is all I remember we all thought it was probably fun but as we all know it was not that is a very fair question Kenyan can you actually prepare for nuclear war um probably not I I guess you could have a hazmat suit and you could prepare in that regard you could build a hole in the ground um which that would probably still not completely keep you safe from it but um I do think that it is import important to have those conversations and I wonder what people that have actually had nukes dropped on them do they have manners in which they prepare before the plausibility that it could potentially happen again in the future like what's going on in Japan so thanks for that feedback and yeah it's a bit ridiculous that they had you put your face against the wall and decide that that was how you were going to be able to deal with radiation Candace you are wonderful thank you everything you said about the Russian Ukrainian conflict is spot on my parents are both immigrants from Eastern Europe and I've been educating my children on the very complex Eastern European conflicts and politics since they were little they're all adults now it is so refreshing to hear someone from the West understand explain this conflict and the involvement of Western Nations I can tell people until I'm blue in the face but most seem to be brainwashed by the mainstream media I would so love this information this video and all your videos to become mainstream thank you for all that you do thank you for saying that I appreciate that feedback as a comment because it's difficult it's not easy for me to inject what to me seems like Common Sense even amongst my peers you know it's they just decide one day they completely understand the media lies to them all the time about virtually everything but then something overseas have happens and they're like no no no no no like they would never lie and I think that my brain works the other way it's like obviously if they would lie to you about what's happening in your own country you are their countrymen these are our politicians right they are more likely to tell us the truth and so if they were aligned to us of course they're going to lie overseas they're going to lie about what's happening overseas if they're happening what's if they're lying about what's happening on our own soil and I'm always hopeful that in having these conversations more and more people are waking up to that truth it's a tough pill to swallow but it's a necessary pill to swallow and as a final comment this is from Paige Vaughn she wrote I'm a few months away from 60 years old I fully remember in school getting under desks for protection however I also remember all the films they had about nukes going off and testing I thought you might I thought you myself I thought to myself I think she meant to say how on Earth could we possibly survive this I would rather be home in my mother's arms and be at school I was one of those kids who thought about everything and ask a million questions that's really in interesting that you're talking about the films that they made you watch in school because something that I've realized has been an uphill battle is talking about Russia to people that are from an older generation and I think that they were scarred uh from the anti-russian propaganda from the cold Warriors I do think that as children when you are traumatized about something in the classroom and you're told to consciously be fearful they all learned that no matter what Russia is the enemy and I find that those people are the most difficult when you try to just inject some truth and you say okay but what about this is what Putin said they're like doesn't matter it's Russia how dare you how is Russia Russia is always the enemy and I'm realizing that it it is almost PTSD that is making them unable to think about Russia more critically that's not to say to support Russia but to think about Russia more critically than to accept the narrative that Putin just didn't take as meds and he's just a madman and he just wants to drop nukes um and so in order for us to remain non-emotional and more rational in our assessments we have to really think about the propaganda that we have survived and it to give you a more current example of that covet right you have a bunch of people that became radical radical about covet but it was a concerted propaganda effort that really went on for two years well I can imagine if you survived all the cold Warriors that you just don't really get over that sort of stuff and there are still people that are wearing masks by choice right I mean maybe it's one or two people now that are on a plane choosing to wear a mask but those people are suffering from a trauma a propagandist trauma that they suffered at the hands of their own countrymen all right ladies and gentlemen thanks for your comments keep them coming and that is all that I will say about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Meghan Markle saying that she felt like she was quote treated like a bimbo during her time on Deal or No Deal man I love

you'll get 30 off your first order of American Meat delivered plus free shipping that's goodwinterest.com Candace and use codecandis at checkout alright so I asked you guys are you holy with a W I'm talking are you a wholesome person and the reason I'm asking that question is because I was on this walk with my husband we like to do these weekly walks where we just sort of unpack our entire weeks and we discuss what we're working on at the office and I talked to him about what I covered on a podcast and I was really struck if you listened to episode 10 we talked about the mental illnesses that social media is creating and they know that they're creating these social media issues and because I was so struck I told my husband about it and he came back to me and told me about an economist whose name is Lou gavcal his name is Lou gavcal and he had written early on about covid being the first social media Contagion so I'm talking basically despite the fact that the illness has a virtual 100 survival rate with 97 98 of people who get coveted Will Survive it didn't matter right we talked about this yesterday people were masking six feet apart people were angry to see people other people breathing freely you would see a child and go you need to match this child if they're over two years old completely arbitrary but somehow people were invested in this and that is because what Lou gavcal speculates a social media Contagion and I offer back that we have seen these sorts of contagions before George Floyd was a social media Global contagion every single person in the entire world knew nothing about the facts surrounding the case they saw just a video and yet they felt that they had to make a statement get involved maybe post a black Square on Instagram to prove that they weren't racist because obviously if you post a black Square on Instagram that means that you're not a racist it's 2022 get with it or whatever and yes that seemed to be a psychological contagion and that happens because of what people are describing as a psychological immune system becoming infested right so much is coming at you that it begins to depress your psychological immune system that at least is what was speculated in the article last week in which we covered again episode 10 if you have not listened to it go back and listen to episode 10 but we cover heard the article written in the New York Post by a doctor entitled how social media is literally making teens mentally ill and why I love this article and a portion of it which we didn't read in last week's episode is that it describes digital toxins right so it's correlating our social media use to drinking right you you keep drinking and alcoholic just keeps consuming and keeps consuming even though they know that it's bad for them it's bad for their biological Health they can't stop because they become addicted well imagine the world that we live in today people are addicted to social media they know it's not good for their mental health but they can't stop consuming all of these digital toxins the article says quote the weaker and more compromised our psychological immune system becomes as we consume these digital toxins making us even more vulnerable for further consumption manipulation and behavior modification it also goes through these three steps that take place that big Tech is using to create these addicts the first step is to create habituation use the most sophisticated algorithm fueled Behavior mod techniques to create dependencies so that's making sure that you are going back to social media in fact that is part of the reason by the way you'll notice on social media apps that you you pull down right you have to swipe down and then it loads up more content for you right with your fingers pull down and then more content is created for you more frequent content is created for you more um uh the most recent content rather is being created for you and that behavior is meant to mimic slot machines I read that a different article that they they thought about that and people are addicted to gambling and they keep pulling down with slot machines and that's what they want you to do that you want more and more the Second Step that they have highlighted in this article it says once addicted the person's psychological immune system begins to erode as in any addiction this is the realm of depression hopelessness and a sense of emptiness and emptiness that can only be temporarily filled by more of a toxin right so you you just keep pulling down okay I need more more and more social media and you're on the inside it's not feeling good but you you feel that you can temporarily temporarily patch that emptiness by getting more content step three once weakened and addicted a person is now susceptible to any number of manipulations these include further addiction ideological brainwashing identity shaping and sadly an encroachment into the once Hallowed Ground of our thoughts free no more so ask me my husband were discussing this article and the implications they're in I began thinking back to another thing that we covered on a past episode which were these assistants that I was going through one year and I was very shocked to see that their behavior uh these these younger kids that are coming up in this generation they they almost believe that they are these luxurious individuals I almost call it Kardashian syndrome right they that they need to live in Swanky Apartments despite the fact that they're in debt they've got student loans but they need to make sure they're living in the swankiest apartments in the city and that they're posting pictures of their Lifestyles you know what I'm talking about these people that put a wine glass they're cheersing to show that look at my glamorous lifestyle that I have even though we know that these individuals don't actually have much money they're actually just pretending to have it for social media likes right I thought about that former assistant that I detailed to you in an earlier episode that wound up stealing from me and my husband and I thought about it in the retrospect because she was obsessed with Instagram not when we first hired her she'd worked for us for a year but then we started realizing that she was spending hours and hours and hours on Instagram in fact there's one particular flight that I remember or I was getting a bunch of work done I was answering emails and that entire flight three and a half hours she was on Instagram and I actually I turned her and I said have you been on Instagram this entire time and she was like yeah you know and I just in my head thought that's really weird how could you be on a social media app like Instagram for three and a half hours straight I didn't realize that she had developed a dependency on Instagram dependency on social media and it was corroding her from the inside out quite literally she was consuming these digital toxins and where did that lead her life well she became more and more extreme in her behavior I detailed to you earlier how despite the fact that she had been put in London in a very nice hotel she told us that she was leaving that hotel to go stay an even more glamorous Hotel even though she was in debt she was actually in debt she had credit card debt and she would speak about how stressed she was about that debt and yet she upgraded herself to a nice five-star fancy hotel in London of course as I told you guys months later we would find out that in fact we had paid personally for that that she was stealing from us and one of the ways that she stole from us was to put herself into that hotel room right under our noses and what did she do when she was in that hotel room she posted a photo of her sitting in a bathtub in this glamorous hotel room I'm I'm laughing but I shouldn't be laughing because it actually makes me feel sad for her that because I didn't know what she was going through I didn't realize that this was the suffering she had been completely invaded by social media she was weakened and what did she begin to do as this article stipulates she began to emulate behave the behavior of others right so she's consuming Kardashian content she's consuming glamorous Lifestyles maybe she's she's consuming The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills right all of this being thrown at her and a piece of her wanted to become those individuals the article talks about how they're seeing all of these pseudo conditions right people that are pseudo-transgendered people that are suffering from pseudo bipolar disorder right from pseudo depression because what's really happening is they just want to find a community online right they're looking to be loved they're going online and they're saying okay these people are living glamorously so I'm going to pretend that I have it like that even though I actually don't what's actually happening is I'm emulating their behavior and the antidote to that as this article describes and the psychologists that participated in this article describes is something as simple as shutting off your social media accounts and engaging in the real world again not something that people are capable of because they are so addicted to it so I started asking my husband I said why are some people not susceptible to that right like why is it that I I don't suffer from this I never feel that I need to sit in a room and be on social media for three and a half hours I don't feel addicted I feel um almost immune like I've developed a very strong psychological immune system what is the difference and we sort of came up with some ideas of how you can protect yourself and you can protect the people that you love um from being attacked from this digital toxins these digital toxins that we're talking about I think the first thing is to ask yourself or to ask somebody else whether or not they are number one a of their holy enough in this world before they take on the online world that's a precursor to social media are you actually a full person right because if you're not a full person if you're not a whole individual and you engage in the digital world it's it's going to consume you that is it it is going to make you think that you should be aspiring to something when in fact you're not even doing anything you're actually sitting idle and looking at other people that are having success in their life and you're not doing anything in your real life so the first thing is to make sure that in your real world you are a whole person and I extend this to children that are coming up in the social media world right let them grow up they don't need Instagram they don't need tick tock my children simply will not be allowed to have it I cringe when I see young kids nine years old 10 years old on Tick Tock doing things for likes these people don't even have these young children their brains are not even developed how do you not expect that to impact them down the line the second thing and it's a really important thing and this came from my husband is to tap in and to ask yourself what you are building your treasure toward right what are you building your treasure toward and I'll explain what I mean by that how are you engaging in the online world who do you follow when you're on Instagram why are you following them take a second and say why am I following this individual are they adding value is there any benefit to why I'm following them and when we have this conversation I went and I looked at my accounts because I follow very few people and sometimes people get angry at me because why don't you follow your fans or follow back and do these things and actually the people that I like to follow are people that I feel contribute value to my life right I like to follow Farm accounts you guys know that I'm into learning how to farm my backyard I like to follow aesthetic accounts I'm I'm very into Home Design it's a passion of ministry it's a hobby of mine really because it's not a job that I have but I like to follow things that are aesthetic and things that are beautiful and things that feel whole I've never in my entire life online if you will have I ever followed the Kardashians or follow people that are just pretending that their lifestyles are normal because it's not what I aspire to I like following people that have families I I love when people post their holiday cards and people that are posting a more wholesome lifestyle and then I actually do this thing where I follow people that I know right people that are in my life I'm interested to keep up with their Lifestyles I'm not following things that feel unattainable and I think that that's important for people think about that what are you building treasure toward you know you might be following a Fox News account good you want to actually know what's going on in the world that's a good thing but are you following people that are just in your mind making you think that you don't have enough is that a good thing for your psychology is that a good thing for your psychological immune system are you going to look back in your life on your deathbed and you're gonna and think that any of that stuff actually mattered it's it's a good thing to think about when you engage in the online world and the last thing that I want to say that I think is really important and is something that I do and I always pause to make sure I do it is to make sure that you're not creating an avatar of yourself meaning that you say things that you don't mean online avoid hyperbole is what I mean to say don't say these extreme things that you know you don't mean like for example a lot of people say when somebody goes online and talks about a crisis happening in their life they say praying for you prayer hands praying for you are you actually praying for them I had that moment when I was texting A girlfriend of mine last week they are losing her father-in-law you know he's dying and I said I texted her and I said well we're praying for you guys and the second I sent that text I said I should not just write that I need to go do that and I paused and I actually said a prayer for them it's important to say what you mean to realize that the person that you are in the online world is going to impact the person that you are in the real world that's all I have to say about that okay before we continue I want to take a quick pause to talk to you about the app hallow you all know that my faith is super important to me my relationship with God is how I find my strength and peace in this crazy world with all of the insane anti-religious ideologies that are being pushed by the left on a daily basis it can be hard to tune out the noise remember what we know is good and true which is why I love hallow hallow is a number one Christian Prayer app in the United States and the number one Catholic app in the world it's rooted in the Catholic tradition but an amazing resource for any Christian looking to dive deeper into their prayer life this is perfect for my family because as most of you know I am in a mixed Faith household my husband is devout Catholic and I am Protestant hallow has prayers and meditations to guide you throughout your entire day morning tonight some of the most popular prayers include the daily Rosary Gospel reading and daily Psalm with Bishop Baron plus there are minute meditations meditations for sleep and kids prayers and meditations hallow helps me sleep better lower my anxiety levels and find peace and calm throughout the day and I think it will do the same for you to try it for three months free at hello.com Candace that's hello.com Candace reclaim your piece and download hello today okay now it's time for some topics to show [Music] first up we have this guy as I mentioned in the opening his name is Dylan mulvani Mulvaney doesn't matter it's a man who began publicly identifying as a female just 191 days ago and despite this fact he has recently been invited to speak at the 2022 Forbes power Women's Summit now that is interesting that he is gathered an extensive social media following uh he did this after he began documenting his creepy fetishized version of what it means to be a girl and so I want you to take a listen to this video that he posted now by the way when you hear this you're going to think it's satire because it seems like he's making a joke but I guess he wasn't take a listen day being a girl and today I'm in nature trees I love them water lakes I love them heels they're my hiking heels I love them Bridges love them coconut water love it not mad just love it wind turbine love it Luke Meadows love them I'm scared of getting Lyme disease [Music] gotta get out of here did you see that there's a dragon oh my God never again get me out of here love you so this sounds like and looks like satire as I said you would think that if you saw this video this was a comedian trying to be funny mocking women right this this idea that women just Frolic in a field wearing heels and go ah scared of a Jersey that's not what that's not representative of what women are but if you were a male comedian mocking women you might be able to get a laugh well no actually apparently this person is now going to be invited to speak at a power Women's Summit because Forbes is taking this person seriously and here's what's more bizarre this person virtually had no followers and then suddenly was being heavily promoted by Tick Tock there is this idea you know Tick Tock is a Chinese owned app owned app Chinese is uh the China the China pardon China is obviously a competitor of America and it seems like they are constantly promoting filth Upon Our Youth I think that Tick Tock is the most extreme app when you talk about protecting your psychological immune system you can hardly utter that phrase without thinking that children should not be on Tick Tock it is absolute garbage it is shortening our attention span but beyond that it is promoting filth like this right now why would the algorithms want you to be taking a look at this why would the algorithms provide steroids to an account like this obviously because they want to promote debauchery they want to make sure the American Youth that are coming up I think this is a good thing that they should aspire to look how many likes you'll get if you are acting like a freak right there's not even a woman that would be frolicking in heels wearing what looks to be a bikini almost a bikini and then screaming about a dragonfly it's it's it's stupid it's an insult to intelligence and yet they made this person so big in such a short time frame that this person is now being invited and awarded by Forbes right how aspirational is that if you act like this if you act like a total wimp if you're bending your gender and you think this is cool look what could happen to you you can get sponsorships you can get invited to Forbes this is what the youth should be focusing on meanwhile of course we know that Tick Tock in China is being used to make sure their youth is smarter right they're getting math equations science equations they're not getting this this of course be banned in China they they recently announced I think I covered this at the end of last year that they were going to pull down any accounts that looked like this because they they do not want their youth to be poisoned with this sort of ideology but in America it's totally fine because the media will reinforce this derivative that it is a good thing it begs the question who is controlling our media why would any media want their youth to be impacted by these sorts of ideas I will leave that as a question for you to consider moving on and talking about psychological immune system you of course have to take a look at the complete and utter corrosion of our culture I often talk about cardi B the reason for that is because she is emblematic of exactly that and I think about Black Culture in particular but it's everywhere right but Black Culture they seem to always want to emphasize right as soon as there was an artist that comes up in Black America they basically encourage that artist to lean into bad stereotypes right to lean into things that are harmful so if you're a rapper they want you to lean in to uh ghetto culture right they want you to be talking about gangs if you're a singer which we're going to get to a little bit later lizzo they want you to lean into being fat all of these things that obviously is just digital toxins for Black America right what you put in on your ears what you're listening to these are all digital toxins they're making you think that you should Aspire toward this life lifestyle because they will reward you no the majority of you if you lived like this you'll probably end up in either prison dead if we're talking about being clinically obese but no it's okay they're going to award a couple of people if we're living like this and encourage a bunch of other people to ruin their lives by aspiring to this so cardi B released a song recently with the artist glorilla I believe that actually it's glorilla song in which cardi is featured on which is called tomorrow too and I'm just going to read you some of these lyrics because I think digital toxins should be spoken about just one portion I don't speak dog hoe wolf I don't care what no [\u00a0__\u00a0] say no I stay on her mind I got condos in that [\u00a0__\u00a0] head uh she say she don't f with me who who said you can ho never that n-word a Munch and he gonna eat me like a mango long ass weave it'd be tickling my ass crack okay okay followed by wonder what I'll do tomorrow that these hoes will be mad at oh Pick Me cardi I can tell you what um I will be mad at and it's the fact that despite the the fact that you made it out which is commendable that is a good thing that you started from a position where you had virtually nothing you got an opportunity on loving hip-hop and now you are in a place where you have some status despite all of those things rather than saying I'm going to use my position for good and I'm going to encourage people to do good you think that you can only stay authentic to yourself by preaching poison you know this is poison you know that the majority of the girls that are listening to this are not ever going to make it out of the hood you know that the majority of the young boys and the young girls that are listening to this are going to think that it's cool to have this sort of drama in their life and they're going to think it's cool to turn to the streets and they may be harmed but you don't care about that because you I guess think that this is all you can be it's not true you can be more you could definitely be more I don't mind where you started what I mind is that you are intentionally denying growth and you think that that keeps you real it doesn't it keeps you it keeps you really stupid and it keeps people that are much smarter than you continually using you like a puppet to further poison the youth in that same vein we should discuss lizzo who had an opportunity I don't know why they gave her this opportunity but they gave her the opportunity to play a 200 year old glass flute that was given to James Madison so that is a historical Relic obviously they're giving her something that means a lot the way in the manner in which they gave it to her and the way in the manner in which she used it offends me I'm not going to lie here is a video of her playing that flute take a listen take this Crystal it's like playing out of a wine glass [Applause] ES foreign [Applause] so I twerked and played James Madison's flu and I made history tonight um okay we'll just so you know a little bit about that flute the antique crystal flute belonged to President James Madison was likely rescued by Dolly Madison when British soldiers set the White House on fire during the war of 1812. so no she's not making history here she's defiling history it's like spraying graffiti on a historical building and going oh it's art no it's not art we're not going to call it art we're not going to call it making history but she doesn't see that right she thinks that when these companies reached out to her these organizations reach out to these opportunities it's because they love her and in reality the reason it's because they hate and want to corrupt the people that follow her right they don't want more people to make it out like lizzo did again I've said this on previous episodes I'm going to say it again I like lizzo's music I think she's talented I think she's tremendously talented I like that she can play the flute I like that she plays other instruments and I love that she contributes to music I just wish that she would contribute positively I wish that she would understand that there are people with more nefarious goals that recognize her as a talented individual and they are using her to sell bad ideas to the rest of society because what they're actually after is to enslave the rest of you right they do not want everybody to be productive they do not want everybody to wake up every day and go to work and to make a lot of money because that is not how it works right the haves want to ensure there is a constant pool of have-nots that's not a conspiracy that's a fact right it is not a conspiracy conspiracy to think that there are people that want you to consume garbage it's not a conspiracy to think that there are people that want to impact your psychological immune system negatively that wants you to constantly live in the state of fear that wants you to constantly live with your hand out and the way that they get you to become that sort of an individual that sort of an individual that will need handouts the sort of individual that will rely on government to give you solutions for the rest of your life is through Artistry it is through Hollywood it is through people like cardi B and lizzo who don't understand that they are Pawns in a game of chess they don't even know that they're playing that's all I have to say about that as a final topic of a day that I want to get into it's actually a daily wire article a bunch of companies are currently removing their advertisements from Twitter over child pornography allegations now I love talking about Twitter because it amazes me what is allowed to stay on Twitter and what gets pulled off remember Donald Trump gloriously taken off of Twitter I don't know because they make you think that he tweeted something that was violent he never did ask the person who says well you know you had to be pulled down for violence ask them to produce Donald Trump's last tweets they're not buying at all not even kind of violent in fact they assessed that it was his offline behavior that determined that he needed to be pulled off online right they need to pull his account online because of what he was doing and saying offline which by the way was also not violent this was just censorship right another example of course is me I recently had my account locked on Twitter for four months because I didn't want to take down the Tweet here is what my tweet actually said an adult man that wants to dress up like a female is a glaring symbol of mental disease a society driven by cowardice prevents this topic from being discussed honestly and openly all of our children are at risk because we refuse to acknowledge and instead encourage mental illness Twitter locked down my account for that tweet talking about mental illness and the signs of it like I don't know Dylan Mulvaney skipping through a forest wearing heels like we discussed earlier that would be an example of glaring mental illness and we are we've become a society of cowards who don't want to discuss that openly for fear of being called transphobic you think I'm transphobic you think I have a phobia a an unrealistic fear of that do you think that if I saw Dylan Mulvaney frolicking through a forest that I would be to skate I would be scared you think that's scary to me no it's sad to me okay it is sad to me that we have a society that encourages that so Twitter saw that tweet for me pulled it down locked my account instantly but apparently according to a Reuters reports tweets that solicit child sex and abuse material are appearing alongside the profile pages of at least 30 major advertisers on Twitter and so these companies are now pulling down their ads they're pulling down their ad services off of the social media platform entirely because they are realizing that for whatever reason child sex abuse online is totally fine for Twitter right they allow these this material to stay online they allow these accounts to stay online I mean you can go on Twitter right now and you can find hardcore porn that is not problematic at all not at all and finally some companies are saying you know what this is getting a little strange why why does Kenneth Owens have to be frozen on the internet and not allowed to use her account we're talking about glaring signs of mental disease in an eloquent manner no one was called a name I didn't use a picture of a person and say this person has mental disease that's got to go but for whatever reason these pedophilic accounts can stay people that are looking for children to have sex with are allowed to stay so companies like Dyson Ecolab and Mazda are either pausing or pulling down their ads entirely from the platform Mazda now prohibits its ads from appearing on Twitter profile pages and apparently according to the report there are more than 500 accounts that openly share or request child sex abuse material for 20 days during September alone so during this month 500 accounts that were just openly requesting to see child pornography into solicit child sex abuse material none of them are pulled down but me I gotta go guys I don't know I just I have this knack for understanding that there is a more Sinister agenda that is happening on social media I want you to think about that I want you to know that when you engage in social media that there are people that want to harm you there are people that want to harm your children and these people are in tremendous positions of power it's not just Tick Tock it's Facebook it's Instagram it is Twitter they are in tremendous positions of power and they are trying to corrode your values they are trying to corrode your Psychology by promoting debauchery and that's all I have to say about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about the new research that proves what I have been saying since day one the covid vaccine can cause serious issues especially for a woman's menstrual cycle so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "wqY6zFopCFU": "i started having this discussion with my husband and thinking wow it's scary to me it's scary to me to to think that there are so many people that are living so on edge and i started examining this and started reading these research papers on this new psychological disorder that i've been identifying and what i actually found out about this is that for men they tend to gamble with their finances right so for men they gamble you think about men that play poker men that that bet on sports games well for women that exact same quality is shown through shopping disorders through buying disorders it's a form of gambling right you're just kind of playing with your finances you don't really have the money but oh well you're going to wait until the check comes in for next month and then maybe okay you're going to be able to afford it just kind of skating on thin ice at all times and i thought that is really really interesting and i said to my husband okay just because we have more resources doesn't mean that we're not also being indulgent which brings me back to that question what are you a slave to how are you indulging how can you become a better person to make sure that you're not living in that same capacity because just because you have more money and you maybe have a little cushions in a savings account doesn't mean that you should be an idiot doesn't mean that you should be wasteful and so i started being more conscious of myself and i realized my strange addiction ready guys my strange addiction paper towels it was it's just something that my husband would say wow you used a lot of paper towels and i started being more conscious of this and i realized that i would cook dinner and then if you looked into the trash i maybe used like an entire role it was psychotic i don't i don't understand i'm just wiping and using paper towels like a psychopath all throughout um all throughout cooking all throughout cleaning i was thinking in my head how much money is this costing me this little habit that i go well it's fine i can afford paper towels it's not a big deal who cares we can afford paper towels but no then i started to care about this and i thought to myself this is extremely indulgent it's completely psychotic why am i using this many paper towels so i actually asked my producers to look into this paper towel phenomenon it seems like a weird strange addiction but it's i do it without really being aware here are some interesting facts about paper towels ready according to data from euro monitor international global spending on paper towels for use at home but not in office or public bathrooms just at home ready added up to about 12 billion dollars in 2017 and americans accounted for about 5.7 billion dollars of that total listen if america is 5.7 billion dollars of that total let me tell you i think i'm 3.7 billion just it's me i am a problem okay so the u.s spends nearly as much on paper towels as every other country in the world combined what it's completely crazy we have this weird paper towel fetish the next stat over 13 billion pounds of paper towels are used per year in america alone so it might seem silly but i decided to stop contributing to that and i did something i mean i've been using paper towels for as long as i can remember i just purchased some rags i told everybody in my household to please stop using paper towels and just start using rags that we could then clean and we could put into the wash after because it just makes more sense again it's a small indulgent behavior but i just wanted to correct it because having more doesn't mean that you should be acting you know stupid in any capacity so i wanted to really think about what it meant that america you know we really are just considered an indulgent culture we just more more more excess excess excess we like wealth we like money and maybe that is the result of living in a free market capitalist society and definitely as a result of being a society that glorifies hollywood so much right this is like this is the result of all of those things but i want to look around and sort of examine where we are seeing this and it brings me to the cultural topic of the day which is lizzo right lizzo to me is so emblematic of this more more and more society that we live in in fact she might be the first artist to say i am unbelievably fat and being fat is delicious oh you should all want to be like me and be more fat it's amazing look at my lifestyle i'm half naked standing in front of a private plane there are photos of her actually doing that i'm half naked on the sidelines at basketball games but i'm look i'm in the front row this is i'm wealthy i'm fabulous and i'm fat and i'm happy and you should aspire to this too and people applaud her all the time they yes they love it i don't know people want more of this lack of substance is what it really is but give me give us more liz i'll give us more fat and the company instacart has decided to make her the face ready here is a recent commercial that they came out featuring lizzo what am i gonna get oh cherries oh okay how about cherry ice cream with sprinkles and maybe a baguette and a french boy you know what i need bath bombs bombs away gotta have takis oh i need balls okay i'm gonna need some glue oh and a new charger i can never find those things and i gotta get flowers for mommy and a little something for me [Music] so there it is lizzo sitting in a bathtub ordering everything that her heart could possibly desire putting takis in her instacart surrounded by food and fairies and just luxury because why not right why don't we want lizzo in a bathtub ordering a bunch of stuff this is america more more more excess excess excess and of course nobody wants to tell you the truth here's the truth uh there's you cannot let somebody lead you to believe that lizzo is a happy individual right she is clinically obese you know how exhausting it must be to carry around that weight all day i mean i think about when i indulge as i did when i was in los angeles this week and i had two in and out burgers i'm like i never get in and out so i had two single in and out burgers and it was so good going down that instant high that you get from bad food and then afterwards as i had to sit on a flight for four hours i just was like i feel disgusting oh i just want to go for a run i want to get rid of this right that temporary high follow followed by this long period of just downness being like oh i just need to move my body sitting stationary on a plane after eating two burgers not a good feeling at all right it's not a form of punishment but i just felt when i got home the next day i wanted to just kind of you know go for a run move my body and that was actually real happiness right so what she's selling to you lizzo and what instacart is selling to you is a lie these indulgences don't make us more happy you might get some temporary kick a little rush of serotonin when you first put all of this gross food into your mouth or you might get a temporary high when you first purchase that thing that you don't really have money for but oh i'm just going to buy this louis vuitton bag i'm just going to buy these earrings i'm just going to buy this stuff because i keep seeing the ads appear on facebook there's a temporary high maybe even when you're opening the package right you get home oh my god there it is my package from revolve oh my gosh this cute outfit i saw right nice little temporary high and then you go to your bank account and you're like i'm skating again i'm just barely getting by i have this angst and i have this anxiety because i'm not i'm not comfortable i'm not financially comfortable you that angst that anxiety is something that lizzo experiences every day there's no doubt in my mind that lizzo has to be suffering from different forms of some form of a depression because that's what happens when you're carrying around that much weight all the time your body does not signal to your body that you are happy to lie this commercial is a lie lizzo is a lie and what do these lies lead to what what does it naturally yield when we are consistently telling people that more more and more and more and more or one of them happier well i think actually it leads to a society that is primed for socialism why do you think it people respond so well when you say this should be free and this should be free and this should be free well because the majority of these people can never have enough right more and more and more and more but i can't really afford it so when someone gets on a platform and they say well we're gonna make this free right this should be someone else's responsibility it's the it's the upper one percent that are the problem people go oh yeah that's it i'm not the problem i'm not it's because they have too much not that i'm irresponsible but they have too much tax them more give us more free stuff that my friends is a state of american politics today thanks for joining me on this

like do you want eggnog when I say it hey would you like some eggnog I don't know what that is sounds like an old school noogies on top of your head this is your egg and you're gonna get a nog you know I just I'm not with it at all and I just if they change the name I would maybe call it something like Christmas Christmas sprinkle Christmas cream you know like some heavy cream I don't know season I don't know just something other than eggnog okay that's it", "KCqhvPZ_Mac": "now it's time for me to answer some of your questions let's get right into it the first question is what are your thoughts on Andrew Tate okay so Andrew Tate if you guys are listening and you don't know who he is I would I guess describe him as an online personality that is a part of the nanosphere what am I talking about when I say the manosphere there are I guess sort of some public figures that have Arisen that really kind of impress upon manhood sometimes in a more extreme way you can think about Andrew Tate someone who is also followed and adored by a lot of men is Dan Bilzerian who sort of lives this lifestyle the rich and the famous and is constantly surrounded by women notoriously was there was also Kevin Samuels who spoke directly to men he had a male dominated audience he was um a commentator who was really really hated by black women he was also black but because he sort of spoke to you know what it means to be a man and so I want to sort of introduce this video compilation of Andrew tape just so you can get an idea of who exactly it is that we are talking about take a listen if I were to get on a plane and I were to that plane was to fly into the eye of a hurricane there was a 50 chance of it crashing I'd want a male pilot because I think that males are better under stress and Under Pressure I think they're less likely to get emotional in the in the in a life or death situation that's why they make better soldiers that doesn't mean I must that doesn't make me a misogynist that doesn't make me sexist that's just true women are better at other things than men and I'll sit here and say women are better at X but I will say that men are better at why I'm not going to sit and pretend that that we're all the same we're not under pressure when your life is on the line anyone with anyone who's honest would want a male pilot in said situation you would not want a female pilot I am extremely versed in CPR I do know how to administer CPR however I will not administer CPR unless you're a hot female this is the reality if you're some fat dude and you just had a heart attack and I don't really know you you're gonna die I mean if you're a really good friend no not even if you're a friend you bet if you're my friend you just can't be we'll head to her attack get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up what's wrong with you go hospital later have a drink cigarette cup of coffee back in the game I'm having heart attacks near me so none of my friends would even have those kind of problems because I don't roll with [\u00a0__\u00a0] little [\u00a0__\u00a0] but if you're some dude I don't know and you need CPR I never would look at me who knows CPR well me help him no why because I ain't gay what would you do if I wanted to start an only fans I don't think there's anything intrinsically wrong with women doing only things as long as I had influence of control over it what'd you mean it's gonna be their photographer to get the angles yeah no no no no I'm not doing any real work but just like taking all the money if my chick said I won't do only fans I'm like all right then call go do it how much you made 10 grand all right give me eight all right cool why would what woman is going to give you eight grand you're my woman you're doing only fans you're selling my product your products yes next question no I don't know if you're being serious I'm totally serious how would I let my chick the only thing to keep all the money that's disrespectful what woman is ever going to give you that don't you very much the only fans duh I say things that they know are true and that they agree with but I say in a way the angerism emotionally and they get caught up in their brain because they're saying he's saying the truth but I'm pissed off by how he's saying it so I want to argue with him but he's right so instead of saying men are physically stronger than women I'll say females are weak females are weak well females are weak females are weak men are strong females are weak no no but females but I'm right and he knows I'm right but he's mad now and so is she and they sit there and you'll happen to have it on Dave fortnite you end up having a whole group of people sitting there trying to argue well some women are strong like men trying to argue the fact that women are as strong as men physically because I've emotionally controlled them all and upset them all so you get it and if you're listening and not watching he's always wearing sunglasses he's embodying a character and he has developed in response a legion of fans that support him so my thoughts on him getting banned is that it's ridiculous You can disagree with some of his ideas right do I agree that if your girl has an only fans account as he once said that you should be entitled to 80 of it because your woman is your property no I don't agree with that but I would host them and I would debate him on that I'm not offended by him even saying it I think it's stupid and I would debate him any day of the week on that because I think it's just it's not even productive to society but why is he getting and for this what is he really getting banned for you don't get banned for bad ideas but you do get banned for ideas that are against the wave of the leftist narrative the fact that we have people and individuals that are on Tick Tock right what's worse Tick Tock advocating for minor attracted persons advocating for pedophilia trying to put a ribbon on pedophilia right pretending that it's just a sexual preference as if you're lesbian or gay yeah I'm into children that's the stuff that you can find online you actually you can find professors that are talking about that that are trying to introduce these Concepts what's worse people that are advocating for the castration of our children teaching children that they can pick their gender and that they should want and aspire to go on puberty blockers which we know causes irreparable harm to their bodies people that will grow up and they will actually not be able to have normal sexual functions people that grow up to be a asexual because they thought they could just press pause on their puberty because that's what they learned online and a bunch of celebrities got in line and said that's great the trans agenda what's worse these celebrities that are advocating for the harm of our children through all of these various means or a guy that's a part of a manosphere that's clearly playing a part I'll also say this why do these people get so many followers why does Andrew Tate get so many followers why does Dan Bilzerian why do Dave Portner now these people are different but why do they Inspire so many men to want to get behind them well maybe it's because we are living in a society that keeps trying to force the Other Extreme these men are hungry for leadership they want to be told that it's okay to be a man right because everything around them look at the media oh toxic masculinity oh you're a bad person if you don't have your tail between your legs oh the woman should act like men and the men should act like women right men should apologize for being men that is the message that is coming from the mainstream media and so of course these men are looking for something else like give me anything else give me somebody that at least says it's okay to be a man and these men do it they say it's cool I like hot chicks and guys go yeah awesome at least we said it stop trying to tell men they have to like fat people right you have to like lizzo if you don't think that lizzo is hot sauce then you're problematic right that's the message that they're getting so then someone gets in the platform and they say water is wet they say hot chicks are hot and these men celebrate as they should because they need to stop hearing these ridiculously toxic ideas and stop being led to believe that there's no place for them in our society I'll wrap this portion by saying this there is no society that can survive without strong men so this is the natural response to a society that is impressing upon male weakness you're going to get the other extreme why are you so Pro Kanye I got this question a lot and yesterday I posted a photo of me wearing Yeezy Gap he asked Kanye and I are friends first and foremost and he asked me to be a part of that campaign and I said yes I think he is a fashion genius if you have watched his documentary on Netflix you will see that Kanye West is somebody who is tremendous and I I value him as a friend that's I mean the best way to say it before I ever got into politics here's a little fun backstory it was Kanye's music that inspired me to sort of figuratively jump out of the window and just go for it there's a song called power that I listened to on repeat this is before I ever knew him before I was even a public figure I would listen to a song power on repeat and it gave me the courage to do something different to be willing to be a black conservative in the open space that wasn't going to apologize for my conservative ISM of course I am not the first black conservative to have a platform but I think I'm one of the only ones there might be a few that won't apologize for who I am and I do credit that courage that I have with a lot of Kanye's music and for those of you that follow it he has always been someone that has been courageous in many capacities when he's been told that he can't so Kanye's story starts with Kanye being a producer he produced everybody's music in hip-hop and then he said I want to produce my own music and they said to him oh no no no you just make the Beats you just produce the music you're just a producer and he refused and he stood up against that mob if you will and he introduced his own his own music and then he won Grammys and suddenly it was Kanye West you make music amazing then he said okay well I want to get into fashion and they said no no no no no no no no no what is a rapper like you going to do in this High Society fashion community and he was told no and look at him now the most successful sneaker in America uh with the Yeezys and a billion he became a billionaire obviously via his partnership with gap and his partner ship with Adidas so I think Kanye is someone who should be admired for his perseverance and for his willingness to as he said in past songs turn a room full of no's into a yes the next portion of the show as you know as always is only going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to expand on the topics of today plus I'll share my thoughts on Andrew Tate we're getting a lot of questions about Andrew Tate who you guys know has recently been banned from everything and I actually know him since before this Banning so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]

been paying attention to the headlines recently you may have caught a viral story about a young man named dj ferguson who was lying in the hospital awaiting a heart transplant he was removed from a list for refusing the covet 19 vaccine now i'm not going to lie when i saw this story i thought my gosh look at the narrative here that this man is so willing to stand by his principles that he's willing to die and leave his young family but is that the truth i wanted to find out for myself so me and my team traveled to boston to speak with dj ferguson and his family here's what they had to say take a look heather you have two children and one on the way uh with a man named dj i do that it's correct it's a very exciting time for most people you have a baby on the way um and you were telling me that you and dj had some life plans and and things took a turn yeah actually so right before this um we were looking into buying some property up north we wanted to get out of the hustle and bustle and just kind of live a simple life up north with our kids and literally a week later our lives just got flipped upside down what happened so honestly we just um days before thanksgiving he kind of just came down with like some cold symptoms um typical guy could not get him to go to the doctor so um finally i was able to get him to go to urgent care told him we'd be in and out in 20 minutes probably with some antibiotics and from there we just never left the hospital what did they end up discovering so after about 40 days they finally brought in some of the best specialists that um confirmed he was an end-stage heart failure i hope you are enjoying this conversation we will get right back into it in just a minute but first let's talk about inflation 40 years ago ronald reagan saw massive inflation unlike anything the country had ever seen before until today in reagan's own words inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hitman right now your retirement accounts are under attack thanks to the inflationary policies of this administration if you have not yet called birch gold and you are missing the boat actually you're

he comes down with the cold and then finds out that he's an end stage heart failure that is staggering yeah i was devastating yeah totally a change of plans and um you guys end up getting him on the list for a heart transplant yeah we did yeah he went through all the testing which actually is a lot harder than people think it's much more than blood work like they went into both his heart and lungs with a catheter twice um doing all the measurements everything has to be perfect in order to be accepted onto that list and he he passed everything with flying colors so you were hopeful yeah yeah great news and this is at brigham young is that right uh brigham and women's yeah okay right here in boston you're hopeful and then and then what happened so um basically i would say about four days after he was accepted they told him we really need to get the process going here we're thinking you're going to need this done soon and right before he was listed they told us you know there's a difference between getting accepted onto the list and then having your name being physically active on the list so he was accepted onto the list but then they told us they weren't going to activate his name on the list due to him not being vaccinated who told you that um so this was one of the head cardio doctors who is also on the transplant board itself okay so there's a board of people that are making these decisions and are any of these people i mean what incentive would they have to to not want to see somebody get a heart you know what i honestly don't even know what to say to that yeah it's worth investigating right well what gets me right is that they're telling us that you know these organs are precious right not everyone can just get a transplant when they need one not only do you have to go through all this testing but there's also a huge shortage of these organs and they're deciding who is deserving of them and that's what i'm not understanding where organ donors i don't care who gets my organs after i go i don't care if it's someone that's vaccinated or unvaccinated or whatever and for them to tell us that he's undeserving of a heart because he doesn't have a vaccine that came out a year ago it's just it's really sickening to me honestly right what gets me right is that they're telling us that you know these organs are precious right not everyone can just get a transplant when they need one um not only do you have to go through all this testing but there's also a huge shortage of these organs and they're deciding who is deserving of them and that's what i'm not understanding we're organ donors i don't care who gets my organs after i go i don't care if it's someone that's vaccinated or unvaccinated or whatever and for them to tell us that he's

question of the day are you in a cult don't worry I have the answer to the question for you this time and the answer is yes you are in a cult so the better question is which one plus we're going to be discussing two gay men in New York City who decided to sue the city why because they claim Insurance should cover their surrogacy and IVF treatments do they have a point let's talk about that all that and more today on Candice Owens [Music] foreign guys I want to take a moment to talk to you about good ranchers you all know I love this brand because they deliver hand-cut and trimmed meat right to

free shipping that's good ranchers.com Candace and use codecandis at checkout alright so I asked you guys a question are you in a cult and the answer is yes s but which one are you in first and foremost let's get into the definition of a cult the definition is a sect generally considered to be extreme or false under the guidance of an authoritarian or charismatic leader and the word cult derives from the Latin word cultist which is a noun which means training education adoration to cultivate and back to that word uh adoration or love for and I was thinking about this topic and thinking about various Cults because I was thinking of the term pop culture obviously culture has the word cult in it for a reason I was thinking about the social media influencers which no matter how strong you think you are against the influential wave of influencers they are in probably some regard influencing your actions or your bias you might see something oh I love this oh my gosh I have to grab this really quickly I saw on Instagram and it's great I mean even my myself if I recently bought some hair ties because some influencer used them and I went I bet that will work good on my hair I also uh I would say if I'm in any cult it's probably the fitness cult I love to watch girls um that are working out on Instagram and without using a bunch of Weights that lets me know what sorts of workouts I can do when I'm on the road so really apps like Instagram and Facebook and all of social media was designed for you to find your cult so to speak but the problem with pop culture pop coming from the word popular culture coming from the world's cult is that it can influence you to hold more extreme views it can influence you to believe in false things in fact I wouldn't say they're just trying to influence you to them to believe them I would say that eventually when you have people in a clique like Hollywood these are people that are selected to encourage and to demand that you follow certain waves so when we talk about the sort of individual that I always describe as being just a robot right they all kind of say the same language it's sustainable or they are talking about climate change and then it's black lives matter the next day and it's a rainbow flag on their uh profile picture and then of course uh if they're not shouting black lives matter because they're not being told to the next thing they're throwing up is a Ukraine flag of course because that is what pop culture is demanding right now it's a cult surrounding this idea that the West must step up and go to war to defend Ukraine which the majority of Americans can't point out on a map because as you may or may not know the majority of Americans can't even point out all 50 states but suddenly they are experts they are foreign policy experts because I don't know somebody that they follow told them that they should be pro-ukraine this is nonsense that I've never fallen for of course because as we discussed in an earlier episode this week zelenski is and always has been corrupt and the West the Western media used to agree on that notion you only have to travel back about three years to find articles in the Washington Post and in the New York Times describing his ties to these oligarchs describing how corrupt he was the questions that were surrounding his election we know that his election was funded by a Russian oligarch it's essentially he was planted as the president of zelenski but hey now the celebrities are saying that we must love zelenski how do you know that he is complete Paw Patrol because he was on the cover of Vogue he's in the cover of Vanity Fair he's on the cover of every single magazine that tries to tell us and tries to what's the word cultivate our likes to cultivate the things that we must suddenly adore one person uh who seems to be pretty resilient to the tides of pop culture and now has landed himself into some more deep trouble is Elon Musk yeah he's been trending over the last 48 hours because he made the mistake on weighing in on an already established narrative regarding Russia and Ukraine here is what he tweeted he tweeted actually just some bullet points of what we could do if we were interested in solving conflict in the region this is his tweet verbatim he wrote redo elections of the next regions under U.N supervision Russia leaves if that is the will of the people next one Crimea formerly part of Russia as it has been since 1783 until khrushchev's mistake next Point water supply to Crimea assured next Point Ukraine remains neutral so essentially what he's offering is that uh Ukraine should not be joining NATO which if you are not reading the mainstream media and are actually reading Putin's speeches and what he is saying in each and every one of his species since the beginning of this conflict he does not want the what he does not want Ukraine which is a next-door neighbor to Russia to join NATO NATO obviously has boots on the ground we are talking about having essentially an Army on his border and we have been expanding uh further and further Eastward and he believes that this is in violation of promises that we made promises that you can find in Declassified CIA documents between James Baker having a conversation uh agreeing that there were not one inch Eastward now this was never formally written in a document and that seems to me to be a very flimsy argument against uh Ukraine joining NATO but apparently these arguments are being allowed in the western media they're pretending that Putin just woke up one day and didn't take his crazy pills and decided to invade Ukraine and I think even more hilariously is the idea that he wants the Soviet Union to come back together again he wants to take over the world that he's act after global ambition quick reminder the Russian economy smaller than California if you uh really are aspiring to take over the world you're going to need a little bit more money and they know that so they just give us the fodder which is Putin bad Russia bad now suddenly we're all allowed to be Russo phobes uh they're kicking Russians out of ballets and they're promoting ukrainians everywhere and what's really happening is we're expanding what uh we're expanding East Putin doesn't want that to happen and we are essentially fighting a proxy war in the middle of Ukraine so again Elon Musk tweets this puts out his opinion that if we wanted to end this hey let's just not do that and allow Crimea to be a part of Russia that is another region that the West wants back in the conflict even though they had a an election that the West claims was not free and fair God forbid you say that as an American about our elections they will January 6 you and lock you up right we're allowed to say it about other people's elections but here in America our elections are always free and fair so despite all of this Elon Musk had the courage to tweet this and of course he's trending people are angry at him how dare he go against the narrative how dare Elon Musk have the courage to go against the wave of Pop Culture honestly I think we should be calling it pop fiction most of the time but for whatever reason people just cannot process that the propaganda that you learned about when you were in school the propaganda surrounding World War II the people that you studied like Joseph gobbels these individuals wrote the formula that is being executed upon us today propaganda exists in both the Western and the Eastern Hemisphere it you do not live in some special nation that does not engage in propaganda the reason that they engage in propaganda is to make sure that the masses are not too informed obviously an overly educated mind cannot be enslaved they want us all enslaved to whatever the narrative is and they don't want us asking questions asking informed questions in fact when you ask informed questions or you put out informed tweets like Elon Musk just did you get bit and so now he is referred to as a Russian puppet join the club Elon we're all Russian puppets apparently I think they even said that I must be accepting money from Vladimir Putin um and that's just what they say and nobody should ask any questions because how dare you I wanted to continue this topic regarding pop culture because as I gain more uh access to the web of influencers in Hollywood I start to learn more about their deceptions and their lies and a lot of it is in my opinion evil and some of it is purely satanic when we talk about them influencing people to pick their own genders or influencing children um you know to go through stages of blocking their puberty so that they don't grow up to be reproductive human beings but they also Influence People in terms of weight right if you're noticing right now skinny is back in so I'm going to let you on a little Hollywood secret that nobody's telling you when I say skinny is back in I am talking about people that were embracing their curves for a while and kind of making the thick girl come back and saying oh now it's better to have you know everyone's getting the Brazilian butts and the big boobs and the implants that was the Hollywood Trend I feel like over the last five years but now everybody trying to get dangerously thin again right anorexia is making a comeback great I guess I guess that's kind of the messaging that's coming from pop culture and I recently found out that a lot of these influencers are completely lying about how they lost weight now you may just have questions as just one example Khloe Kardashian we have got to really see her grow up in the public eye we know that she has struggled with her weight forever now she is half my size and at the very same time her and Kim both a both lost a lot of weight that is a fact you can look at pictures around the same time leading up to the Met Gala you'll remember Kim shows up at the Met Gala and she looks very very thin and she's wearing Marilyn Monroe's dress and people are asking questions about how she lost so much weight to be able to fit into this dress and she says that she basically just didn't eat and she lost a bunch of weight okay maybe don't know her personally that might be true strange that she lost all this weight at the same time that her big sister who has struggled with weight in the public Sphere for decades suddenly dropped a ton of weight and then you see both of them and they have maintained keeping all of this weight off and they're very very thin to the point that with Khloe Kardashian I would say it looks unhealthy right you're starting to see her vein she's actually looking older because she's gotten so thin they're not the only ones I'm just using them as examples uh so recently I found out actually that what's trending over in Hollywood is a shots an injection that celebrities are getting again I can't attach this injection to Kim and Chloe I don't know them or any of the other people in Hollywood that are doing this but you should know about it um and make your draw your own conclusions or make your own speculation about it it is referred to it has a two names it's wagovi and it is also ozempic I'm writing it down looking at it right here ozepik and wagovi and what it is is a semi-glutide which is sold under the brand name ozempic or wagovi and what it forces is for the body's stomach to slow down from emptying it basically makes the individual once they get this injection feel like they're full so they can literally just not eat so maybe that part of what she's saying could be true if this is what she's doing um so people are starting to get these injections all over in fact if you go to the website of wagovi orozmic it tells you that they're out of stock right because it started over as a trend and now everyone in Hollywood is demanding to get these injections these injections cost about fifteen hundred dollars every time that you are injected and variety magazine actually reported on this reported on so many celebrities that are turning to this drug and it even went viral on Tick Tock under the hashtag myosampic Journey which showcased people that were openly taking this drug and then showing their Transformations so this was initially designed Mind by the way to help fight the Obesity epidemic so this shot is not for people in Hollywood to look their best before they walk the Met Gala this shot is actually intended for people that absolutely need to lose the weight because you drop so much weight so quickly uh but of course everything that is bad Trends in Hollywood and it's not enough to just be a regular sized person which is what I would say Khloe Kardashian was that people want to be deathly skinny they're constantly looking for the Fountain of what they preserve to be youth they want to be they want to be thin they want to be beautiful they want to look like they're never aging and so this is what is going on in Hollywood now I want to tell you of course that there's no such thing as a miracle drug even if you think that losing that much weight temporarily is a miracle oh my gosh it's a miracle it of course has some very serious side effects and the things that um are included things that could possibly happen cancer it literally says that will Govi may cause serious side effects including possible thyroid tumors including cancer in studies with road with rodents will go be in medicines that work like bulgov caused thyroid tumors including thyroid cancer it is not known if agovi will cause thyroid tumors or a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma in people I mean that is on the packaging right you may or may not get cancer we can't tell you but when we experimented on rodents yeah they did get cancer so um it would be interesting to see if a bunch of people start popping up with thyroid cancer in Hollywood let me tell you it is an extremely rare form of cancer so suddenly people start saying that they have it um I think it will probably point to the fact that these people are so willing so dying to be thin so dying to look good so dying to fit into a dress or maybe to fit into a suit that they're willing to go through these extremes and what bothers me about this is I'm personally a believer that if you want to you know how I am obviously my opinion on vaccines that topic if you want to do it go ahead live your life roll up your sleeve get 14 vaccines a day not my problem get the will go be shot you know what the risks are you see what the side effects are you're looking at these studies yourself and you're thinking hey to get into that dress I'd get thyroid cancer many times it's a one of the more survivable types of cancer okay totally fine but what bothers me is that because they are part of Pop Culture right because they are creating this cult around them people actually believing that these women got thin all by themselves that no drugs were involved in this and nobody got an injection that they just starve themselves for a couple of days and now they're all a size zero because people are believing this what they're really promoting it's not what Govi you want people know their secrets they're promoting anorexia right this gets back to that cult these people that want to cultivate an idea around their likeness people that are wanting to be like these individuals in Hollywood then say okay well you know what I'm just not going to eat because I want to look like that and it clearly worked for her she just didn't eat for a few days and it leads to more sad people more sick people in the end again do what you want to do but be willing to tell the truth otherwise you're worse than a cult actually you're exactly what a cult is you are based around extreme ideas that are false and you are operating those ideas under the guidance of the fact that you have become a charismatic leader for so many of these young men and women who don't have a shot in hell because they are following Trends and hashtags on social media and that's all I have to say about that [Music] okay so you'll recall a couple of days ago when we went over Putin's speech and in one portion of it he started talking about what he reviewed to be satanic a Satanism that is coming up in the west right talking about children being allowed to pick their genders among other things but he also spoke about the attack on the nuclear family by saying they want you to not just have a mother and a father but even even more people now in the family unit and how nonsensical it was and how wrong it was and ultimately again how satanic it was well here's a first story for you coming out of New York of course I feel like New York and California is where all of the crazy stuff happens but a New York judge has just ruled in favor of polyamorous relationships so yes more than just a mom and a dad maybe a third or a fourth person in the home basically the background of the story concerns a couple Scott Anderson and Marcus O'Neill that were living together in New York City in an apartment it was Anderson Scott Anderson who held the lease even though he was married to another man Robert Romano who lived at a different address well Scott Anderson died and Marcus O'Neill still wanted to live there and wanted to renew the lease but the owner the building's owner said no you can't renew police your uh partner I guess just died you have no claim to this lease you are not married to this individual while Marcus said hey that's not cool actually we are in a polyamorous relationship there's more than two of us that's why I'm living in the house and the husband Robert lives somewhere else so he takes this story and he takes this case to the New York city courts uh to the New York courts courts pardon and the New York judge ruled in favor in fact not only did he rule in favor but I would say that the judge ruled passionately in favor of polyama resolution ships he asks the question why then except for the very real possibility of implicit majoritarian animus is the limitation of two persons inserted into the definition of a family-like relationship for the purposes of receiving the same protections from eviction accorded to legally formalized or blood relationships is to a code word for monogamy why does a person have to be committed to one other person in only certain prescribed ways in order to enjoy stability in housing after the departure of a loved one why why I don't know maybe because that's the definition of marriage that's what's always been the definition of marriage but of course in a world in which we have the left that wants to attack every layer of our culture and just pretend that you know it's all subjective there's no such thing as objective truth there's no why would a marriage between two people why couldn't imperage first and foremost be between a man and a woman right it could be between a man and a dog it could be between a woman and a cat here's where we're at in society right nothing is real why are we limiting what about the cat is there a cat in that household maybe the cat actually should be allowed to sign a lease there's no such thing as objectivity anymore so of course this judge says you now have a right to resign the lease because you were in a polyamorous relationship and there were three of you and things were I guess Facebook it's complicated status and you should just be allowed to live there and this has been going on for a while by the way they're in the background the courts have kind of been going in this direction and when we talk about those attacks that we're seeing coming from the East regarding Western culture this is the reason because things are completely crazy town over here and we now have people like judges people that are supposed to be of the most sound mind who are able to look at something objectively and to interpret the law in a way that makes sense there falling for this they are falling for the farce of this this complete spiral that our culture is in right where we are pretending that bad is good and good is bad and that there are no rules and all of us can just live outside of the limitations so no I am not surprised to see that in fact I will take it a step further as I have done in past episodes and make the claim now so I can say I told you told you so in a very sad way by the way I'm I'm sad that I know I'm going to be right because what's coming around the corners that's going to be polyamorous relationships it's going to be incest they're already having those conversations I read to you guys an episode last week how there already are articles that are planting the seeds why is incest wrong why is polyamorous relationships wrong eventually there's going to be a judge probably in New York or in California who asked this question why why are we defining relationships is it implied that relationships the sexual relationships should happen outside side of uh that needs to happen outside of your family unit that is going to be coming down the pipeline it is inevitable keep paying attention and next ques the next story that I want to get into is uh if you saw this I'm sorry um I'm sorry if you if you didn't see this because you're about to see it right now is what I should say but there is a woman named Katie darling and she is a business executive she's 36 years old and she is very pregnant and she is running to challenge Republican representative Steve scalise and she is now going viral because her campaign ad features herself giving birth wait for it wait for it but she's advocating for abortion take a listen I'm Katie darling and I live on a farm in St Tammany Parish our family compost collects rain water and grows our own food my husband and daughter helped take care of the chickens and there's someone else who's going to be joining us and helping to pitch in with Farm Life very soon but these days I worry about storms that are stronger and more frequent because of climate change about our kids underperforming Public Schools and about Louisiana's new abortion ban one of the strictest and most severe in the country we should be putting pregnant women at ease now putting their lives at risk I haven't spent my career in Washington I've worked my way up from bartender to CEO now I help nurses organize our complicated health records because nurses aren't just Heroes they're Saints Louisiana deserves better than the path we're on I'm Katie darling and I'm running for congress because I want that better path for you for her and here we go for him yeah so you see her frolicking happily with her family you see that she's got a big belly and I guess they decided early on what a wonderful opportunity for us as I am growing life inside of my womb for me to advocate for our state to make sure that we allow all women the right to rip this life from our wounds and to poison it and to rip it limb from limb uh because I don't know I'm just not ready to have a kid right that's the idea and to use a moment like when you give birth which is one of the most I think it is the most magical moment of any woman's life right to bring life into this world we are given this unique God Design This ability to create life within our womb to be able to feel those precious kicks as that baby gets bigger and gets stronger and and to feel that relationship she's using that as an opportunity to advocate for Satanism right satanism death and destruction and I think it is one of the sickest campaign ads that perhaps she knew it was going to be sick death certainly accomplished what she wanted which was to get people talking about her and I'll bet now that there is going to be some big wig Democrat donor that's going to get behind her in a very big way because when they see evil and they see corruption and they see death and they and they see destruction the first thing they want to know is uh how big the check should be that they're going to write moving on and speaking of crazy things that are going on New York City of course facing a lawsuit from gay men that want to gain access to a woman's body claiming that surrogacy is a fertility treatment now let me explain that that sounds a bit complicated so essentially insurance companies will cover for lesbian couples and for women in general if you go through IVF or if you are going through the surrogacy process you can claim some insurance benefits but you are not allowed to do that if you are a man and so these gay men are wondering why that is if you are able to have those treatments covered uh because you're a woman why can't you have those treatments cover if you are a gay man and you are also in a relationship and to be honest I think what they have here is a pretty sound argument right we talked about surrogacy and we talked about IVF in a previous episode where I asked a lot of questions because For the First Time I began to consider how dark this could really get right because when you're talking about IVF and you're talking about surrogacy you're not talking about the natural process of becoming pregnant you're talking about a process in which the government can lean into and get power eventually right which is what's happening right the government has leaned into this they've said we're going to help you you have insurance companies that say we're going to give you money towards surrogacy or IVF why wouldn't then if you are saying that gay marriage is okay and you are saying and you are supporting gay families why wouldn't a gay couple by that very same logic have access to insurance that is going to back their IVF treatments or the surrogate that they claim to have their baby this I believe is what we refer to as a slippery slope you learn in high school that's a fallacy and it's not real except we prove every single day that it's very real and the only fallacy is believing that the slippery slope fallacy is a fallacy so keep your eye on that my best guess is that they're going to win why not it's New York if we can have polyamorous relationships why can't we have insurance for IVF treatments for gay men in fact I think they should have IVF treatments for thrupples I think if you're a gay man you're a polyamorous relationship you should have access to IVF treatments right Sound Logic that's where we're headed all right guys that's all I have to say about that if you want to hear my

a deep-seated resentment that black women have and so that stereotype of an angry black woman doesn't come from nowhere uh where it comes from is poor government policy and these women that are essentially being neglected by men because the government incentivized that behavior in the 60s with the Great Society act but that is just one part of it that's one piece of it the other piece of it is you have women that are angry in the homes but they're not entirely raising their children because they usually have two jobs three jobs just trying to make ends meets which causes that resentment but then you have these women that are going to school I mean these children that are going to school and the entire system the ecosystem of the education system teaches them that they are righteous in their anger so you have teachers that are saying if you're black you are suffering and it's because of racism well if somebody tells you all the time that you are being victimized and that it's just unfair and that you'll never be able to get ahead that's going to turn you into a doubly resentful individual", "hd6ywTynRcE": "we're gonna follow sort of the category of get your children off of tick tock I think I tell you this all the time I'm like I I don't think I can have a friend that has return on Tick Tock because I think that I would just be drilling into their head at all times like what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing Tick Tock is for freaks fly your freak flag high and that's what's going on there isn't a category you're not going to believe me when I share those with you they're called Reborn Dolls right they are dolls baby dolls and they look incredibly real I'm going to show you a video but in case you're listening to podcasts just have to let you know that these vid that these dolls look incredibly real they're supposed to be hyper realistic dummies that can be treated like real children and even given a birthing ceremony and even a heartbeat the purpose of these olives you're wondering why have they even been created they run you about a thousand dollars by the way if you want to get one of these dolls but the deeper purpose was for them to be used as therapeutic aids to help women that are struggling with infertility miscarriage and or loss of a child as well as people that are generally just suffering from anxiety and depression now I'm going to give you my take first and foremost I don't think that's a good way to deal with loss of a child is by having a doll and treating like a child's I actually think that's going the opposite way I think that that is the worst form of therapy I've ever heard I'd like to read whatever document it is whatever study it is that has concluded that this could be helpful for a woman after suffering a miscarriage that seems like exactly the opposite of what you should do fostering someone's imagination and pretending that they actually have a child cannot be healthy in the long term and anything that is not healthy in the long term mentally you can find on Tick Tock right of course these women by the way there's no evidence that they have suffered from any of these things they just realized that they could buy a lifelike baby doll and this one woman who I'm going to show you has even gone so far as to take this baby doll to the doctor and that's I don't know guys just uh take a listen we're going to be treating it responsibly and she's still running a fever she is hungry because she is really fussy so we're gonna make our bottle again the doctor gave us medicine for her so we are going to give her our medicine so with her medicine policy so let's get into that I'm gonna put her on her crib just so I can have my hands empty Okay so we got for our prescription meds she um our doctor our pediatrician prescribed us with some ibuprofen Okay so we're gonna put this in her passing but first we need to make a bottle actually no we need to do the passing thing first so we've got her medicine pacifier this has been a lifesaver for us two Americans foreign and she would think that's bizarre about this video is by the way it doesn't look like a fake prescription so I'm just very curious as to what she is pulling out of that CVS bag that she is putting into the real milk she's actually purchased real formula never mind that there was a formula shortage because women with fake baby dolls are getting formula and she's making a real bottle and she is putting what looks to be real medicine inside of that bottle to distribute it to her fake baby doll and she's not the only one this is all over Tick Tock of women that get angry with other people that are like what are you doing this is not a real baby doll they get angry and upset because in their minds these are real babies and they are spending real money I mean she might even have already established a college fund for her child who knows how far does it go all I know is that if I ever leave this sign of work I'm going to apply to be her nanny I am I can't think of a better job I'll get into it with her I'll be crazier right she'll come up like shh she just went to sleep please no you know I know I know I know he wasn't acting good he was he was really bad he hit me when you were gone tell your mom what you did we're all going to be crazy let's just be really really crazy let's see how far we can take the crazy ladies and gentlemen keep your children off of tick tock I don't know how many times I can say that how on Earth did time go by this fast would it even get to the Daily comment Roundup it's okay because I'm gonna take it behind the paywall you guys have tons of comments a lot of interesting ones I also I'm going to read somebody's comment regarding when a woman should call the police on

feedback from you guys about me covering culture and I I will I just want to State one more time I'm never going to stop covering culture because it matters and it is because conservatives hold the opinion that it doesn't matter that we have lost so much ground to the left is because we have not made any investment in talking about culture that we have seeded so much ground to the left it is because of this that we are absent in Hollywood and it's because of this that the biggest public figures in the world are left leaning and vote left and they show up when it's time for election season and they stand behind these people and convince the masses the young kids who are seized by culture right they don't care about your policy papers they don't care about the the debates that you guys are having these intellectual debates on stage and these panels they don't care they're watching Kim Kardashian on Instagram and Kim Kardashian says hey go out and vote for Hillary Clinton they go and they do it because that's what it means to be an influencer so if we are not competing there we are competing nowhere for the record once again Andrew Breitbart was correct when he said politics is Downstream from culture and I have been fascinated as you guys know with the Kim Kardashian sex tape story which is so relevant I cannot tell you because if this is correct and by all indications it seems that Ray J her ex is telling the truth that she was not a victim of a sex tape but she orchestrated the sex tape right that she's actually a nasty person behind the scenes who has been hell-bent on being famous and she used a lot of black men in particular to get to where she is and then left them in the dust calls Ray J desperate and you know I don't know what's going on with him and now Kanye is crazy and she's just completely promoted herself to be in the status that she is right now you have Ray J Ray J being the Entertainer who is at the beginning of the story who has spoken out and said this has all been a lie I have had communication with her spanning back for years I have helped turn every aspect of her career pre-congate involvement and he's angry and he is saying he is going to sue this family this is relevant right this is relevant to culture to prove to children and everything that they see is a deception and a lie well some tapes are making the rounds of Kim Kardashian and she's talking trash this is years ago it seems to be a voicemail that she left Ray J where it's not the sweet little Kim K that she presents today she's nasty she's calling Whitney Houston a crackhead and she's yelling at Ray J and this tape landed on my lap and I am told that there is much much more and it is the opposite version of the Kim Kardashian that your kids have been following this is just a sample of the tape again this is a voicemail that she left Ray J take a listen on the machine you clearly want people to call you but yet you won't call me back actually you know what don't call me back ever call me back I never never again I think you're honestly a strict human being and it's just you like it desperate you'll do anything for attention and you're just so disgusting honestly so like how fun with those tag Whitney Houston like she's so sick and like crack is definitely not wax with you guys because you're just on it like makes me laugh on how disgusting you guys look you need to go hang out with your old like friend and it's not right but it's okay I'm definitely gonna make it anyway because you guys are just disgusting and sick and stuff you know with her I don't understand it but she's so old and sick and you are just sick and desperate so leave me alone hey so it's being alleged that she left that voicemail because she was upset that Ray J at that moment was becoming more famous than her because he was dating Whitney Houston who obviously has now passed uh like I said I'm just throwing that out there because there was a lot more that was presented to me from people that are in Ray J's Circle and I am basically openly inviting him to come onto the show I can even do a separate podcast because I think the Kardashian family is potentially a Hollywood cartel and what I mean by that is not that they're moving drugs but I am talking about the control that they have in Hollywood and the lies that they have told to get the work to where they're going and I think that they have left a lot of victims in their wake Ray J included he's rightfully angry and I want to keep covering that because a family like this should be exposed so Ray J if you're seeing this open invite so you are not even going to believe this but you should believe it because it's tick tock tick tock has banned users from even searching for the term White

states quote no results found this phrase may be associated with hateful Behavior Tick Tock is committed to keeping our community safe and working to prevent the spread of hate for more information we invite you to review our community guidelines end quote what are the community guidelines well you can definitely use the hashtag black lives matter you can definitely use the hashtag Asian lives matter you could definitely use the hashtag Latino lives matter all of that is fine but if you use White lives matter it's problematic obviously because being white is problematic in 2022 actually since a little bit earlier being white kind of became problematic starting in I would say maybe 2012 maybe 2008 when we elected Barack Obama suddenly we start felt this shift and it wasn't like we were after equality we just actually wanted to make white people that never had slaves um and white people that weren't behind the segregating policies that we once had in this country under Jim Crow we wanted to make them suffer and so we've been doing that for a while and Tick Tock has taken a strong stance against this because Tick Tock is owned by China who keeps Muslims in concentration camps that's totally fine but but they really care about is the hashtag White lives matter by the way you can if you want to on Tick Tock put up your child talking about their puberty blockers as we have shown on the show also if you want to you can join a community for cutting yourself on Tick Tock as we've shown on the show there are teenagers who are cutting themselves and they join the groups and they're becoming pseudo-trans they're becoming pseudo Cutters and they're showing signs of various disorders that are not actually the real disorders right because they're just trying to find a community and they want to belong to an online community yeah Tick Tock Fosters that environment they love it if you are a guy and you put on a dress and you frolick through the woods and say I'm a woman Tick Tock will make sure that you get tons of followers uh really what Tick Tock is after is furthering the divisive rhetoric they are after furthering The Divide of the American people and what better way to do that than by outright basically having a policy that says white lives don't matter that's what the tick tock policy is and I implore you if you are listening to this show I I say it over and over again this is without question the most harmful app it is the most obvious it is so obvious what China is trying to do which is weaken the American people it is trying to weaken the unity that we have and it is also after your children molding Minds molding Minds to hate white people in this regard molding minds I think that there are no genders molding Minds have a short attention span it is very easy for you to within your own household say tick tock will not be allowed that is a rule in my household I'm a little more extreme my kids are not going to be allowed to have social media full stop until they're old enough but this is what we have to do these little acts of protests start within our own household so please please if you have children that are on Tick Tock just force them delete the app be the bad parent don't be their friend say you know what it's cool because I'm actually not your best friend I'm your mom I'm your dad I'm your grandma I'm your

the latest episode of high low with mrata host Emily rajakowski is talking to a former sex worker Mia Khalifa in case you guys don't know who she is she's actually been very interesting Mia Khalifa was a younger porn star and she essentially said that she only did x amount of videos I'm making up a number here but it was very few it was like 12 and it completely ruined her life and she made no money from it whatsoever and she's kind of been using her platform since to talk about how horrible the porn industry is and how it women are suffering under it that doesn't even make economic sense for the majority of them a lot of them are unwitting participants so I actually deeply respect her for doing this um talking about this topic which most people just sort of dismiss porn stars uh but Mia Khalifa is has is appearing on this podcast with Emily rojakowski and the two of them are talking about men dating younger women or people in general that are dating with a wide age Gap and the opinion that Mia Khalifa expressed and that Emily Rada was in accordance with has upset the internet so I will let you take a listen to that right now any guy who goes after a girl significantly younger than them is severely lacking in their life and I I mean that confidence wise I mean like they are falling short in so many places that that is the only place they can turn to to feel like they have they have something on the scale of power and it's I mean ultimately it's predatory I mean there's just no way to kind of because you're manipulating someone who is not aware of what they're giving you and it's unfair so I don't entirely disagree with the conversation that they're having the first thing that I'll say is I think that Mia is coming from this genuinely where she has seen the insides of an industry where a lot of young women are being taken advantage of and she's giving her opinion that men in power tend to go after really young women uh Emily rojakowski is dealing with her divorce we know that Sebastian bear cheated on her probably with the younger woman so she's nodding her head and agreeing not because she has a thoughtful opinion but because she wants to believe that her husband is a monster and not just that they were in a very dysfunctional relationship but on the topic of people dating with really big age gaps I think there's probably a little more Nuance I find it problematic and I do think that it probably does remark on confidence and a power structure when you have a person like Scott Disick you know he's a part of the Kardashian Clan Courtney Kardashian's baby daddy he makes me uncomfortable he does I find it very weird that he waits for young women to turn 18 and the moment that they turn 18 He dates them he did this with Sophia Richie and he's had a slew of other other women who he stated that literally the day they turn 19 suddenly Scott Disick is dating us if he was waiting for their birthday to go off and then it doesn't make sense like what does a 40 year old man he's 40 have in common or what is he even discussing with an 18 year old girl it doesn't make sense I'm 33 and the idea of me going on a date with an 18 year old boy and I say boy because that is how I would feel about an 18 year old boy it does it just doesn't make sense and the idea that she's 18 but she's so mature and has experience I'm not really buying into that I think it's problematic when you're dating people that are closer in age to your son Miss Mason Disick who I think is maybe uh 12 or something like that than they are to you you so that I do think that that is a power thing and there's a confidence thing and there's something that just creeps me out about it and I'm not trying to be judgmental it's creepy I thought very creepy when Celine Dion married that old man named Renee I mean she was 14 when he was sitting on her I think that she's a victim I I know because I was 18 at one point a girl's mind is just not fully developed when she's 18 years old she's she is for lack of a better word a child and things are a little different I mean those years are very significant the difference between even an 18 year old and a 22 year old is is astounding there's a lot more life experience that goes into that period because obviously you're leaving your household when you're 18. if you're going to college that is you're going to University you have a little more life experience you're not living under your parents protection so I I do agree that it can sometimes be weird but there are also people that have age gaps and they're completely irrelevant I think if you're talking just about really young women there are definitely questions to be asked about what the man is looking for in that relationship now saying all that I also want to say that it's not weird that men like younger women so if you're talking about a 65 year old man and he's gone after a uh 26 year old younger woman it's like that age Gap okay it is stupid we know why he's with her it's because she's hot and she's young and men like hot girls like I like good food so what's not problematize the fact that people prefer a older man would prefer a girl that's better looking you would hope that he would have the emotional maturity to stay with somebody and to grow into old age and still see those Beauties and I think that a spiritual connection is so much more important than a physical connection for those very reasons is he the best guy no is it understandable why a guy might like a younger woman with a larger age gap between the two of them absolutely so you can give me your comments and yell at me and disagree but that's my stance on the discussion that they had alright guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] foreign [Music]", "FB9heQ9TXaY": "all right guys I want to talk to you today about degeneration that's my question for you what does it mean to be a degenerate and speaking of degenerates an Instagram model claims she had an affair with married Maroon 5 front man Adam Levine and classic victim mentality she now says that she feels exploited she's the victim guys all that and more coming up today on Candace Owens [Music] all right guys so I guess that is the vocabulary of the day degenerate what does it actually mean well as defined by Merriam-Webster it means either one having declined or become less specialized as in nature character structure or function from an ancestral or former State second definition is having sunk to a condition below that which is normal to a type especially having sunk to a lower and usually corrupt and vicious States so you're sinking to a lower State I wanted to ask you that question because it's always on my mind I actually in my head I use that word probably more than I should but I think it's good for us to recognize degeneration when we see it so I'll sometimes just be looking at a piece of news and think wow what a total degenerate I mean that what this person is just degenerate right we have sort of lowered the bar here in terms of our society and I do think that American culture at its core has become degenerative thanks to the culture of Hollywood and thanks to the institution of Education which sort of celebrates all things corrupt and all things vicious and I was especially thinking about this because I had a chuckle I was tagged in something on Instagram it was the video of me talking about Kim Kardashian where I called her a prostitute and the comments were shockingly very positive everyone agreed with that statement but there was one woman who although she agreed with me saying that Kim Kardashian and her mother colluding to sell her sex tape was a form of prostitution she was upset that in that video I used the phrase out of wedlock sex I said her mother watched a video referring to Kris Jenner her mother watched a video of Kim Kardashian having out of wedlock sex with her boyfriend and the woman was upset by that she wrote oh okay Candace don't try to push your Christian views on people I just thought to myself what an absolute degenerate comment like why would you be upset maybe you don't believe that people need to wait until they are married to have sex but why would you be so upset to hear someone say out of wedlock sex that you you found it within you to comment on it and to say don't push your Christian views as if I'm the weirdo for saying as if that even belongs by the way just to Christianity as if morality now when we speak of things that are moral and at least things that are good to Aspire to right it's good to Aspire to wanting to have sexual relations with somebody who actually cares about you and wants to be with you for the rest of your life but now we're in this condition where it's like even mentioning that it they think that's dirty like oh my gosh like why would you I want my daughter to have sex with a ton of people before she gets married that was what I was getting from this woman right like how could you even mention out of wedlock sex Candace like it's better people to have tons of sex and then get married I mean what a what a degenerate but this as I said seems to be the state of things today in America and all around the world but of course you see it creeping up all throughout our culture and it's not just sexual relations and by the way don't forget I have told you guys a million times I'm not trying to be the person that oh I'm talking down to you and I'm of High Caliber morality I am a way better person today than I was when I was growing up actually I look back on the choices that I made when I was younger and I think wow I really gave in to a degenerate culture right I always say to people especially when I'm giving speeches I took the most liberal route to conservatism that there ever was because I was a product of my environment and my environment was liberalism my environment was growing up in a school system that celebrated promiscuity right like that woman in the comments don't even say out of wedlock sex it's not natural it's kind of the idea right I learned that in in health class that it was okay to have multiple partners as long as you were having safe sex it's totally fine to have multiple partners and it's old-fashioned it's old-fashioned to to think about out of wedlock sex right and it's not just sexual relationships that we've perverted to the point where people have this visceral response when you say something moral but it's even the institution of marriage right I was thinking about that because I saw a headline uh about Emily ratajikowski I think I'm saying her last name right she is you can describe her I guess as a partial actress her big break was in uh Robin Thicke's music video Blurred Lines if she was completely naked and she sort of just danced naked and topless in this video and she kind of has been dancing naked and topless through life you can go to her Instagram page I'm not painting her in any way that would upset her she's proud of the fact that she is always naked she views this as a form of power for women to be naked all the time so you can see like I said look you can look onto her Instagram page and for whatever reason her breasts are always out she she often has her butt in the air and she just takes these pictures I think the the slang the people are using today is it's a thirst trap right people it's to make people desire you on the internet and I saw a headline uh that she is married was married is getting divorced that her and her husband were divorcing and the headline was commenting on the fact it sounded like something that maybe came directly from her um that sources say sources might have been her that he's an absolute dog and he cheated on her right she she's leaving him because there's been infidelity in their marriage and I chuckled because I just I laughed in my head because I went oh yeah obviously she's always naked on the internet I mean what is it but an act of infidelity in your relationship if you are a married woman and you're constantly naked you're just forever naked on the internet people have this idea that they are I guess not responsible for their virtual Behavior like they do things online but they would never do in person it would be very bizarre right if you're a married woman and you're around a bunch of young guys not your husband and you strip down half naked and you put your button yeah you're just like hey guys what's up hey I'm Emma or you just took your top off and did this and just like covered basically your nipples and you were just like hey guys thirst trap but for whatever reason people have separated themselves they're like oh on Instagram it's totally fine for me to do this it's totally fine for men to lust about me all the time on the internet this is fine because it's just a picture and it's powerful somehow I like to say that you should perform on the Internet it's not a video game okay it's not a video game you don't get to create an avatar of yourself on Instagram and then say Oh that's different no no you should as I like to say behave on Instagram behave on Facebook behave on Twitter behave on the internet as you would in real life right so yeah I I could entirely believe that he was cheating on her because she has been cheating on him in my mind right I feel like I've had sex with Emily rodajkowski every time I'm on the internet and I see her her boobs are out we've all been we've all slept in some capacity with Emily rojakowski I believe she has absolutely no respect for her relationship and how she acts but I guess it was his act of infidelity in what she perceives to be the real world the virtual world is fine her video game character is fine but in the real world you know that's where it actually caused harm to her relationship and now she's bravely leaving him what a generate what an absolute General in my mind this is a degenerated this marriage has generated and you guys have both accepted these terms but this is kind of I'm commenting on that because this is where our society is for whatever reason we we glorify behavior that is obviously degenerate um as just one example there was an actress named Chloe Moretz she was young at the time she was 19 years old and she somehow got into a Twitter spat with the Kardashian family and she was commenting on this sort of pornographic online world and she said she responded to Kim Kardashian who had put a picture of herself naked kind of you know thirst trap hashtag thirst trap here I am naked uh this time Kim was married um and but fully frontal naked with two black stripes to cover the parts that were too rude for Instagram or that Twitter would have pulled down and Chloe Grace responded to this completely fully frontal naked picture and she said Kim I truly hope you realize this is a tweet I truly hope you realize how important setting goals are for young women teaching them that we have so much more to offer than our bodies wow what a beautiful tweet from a teenager that is just saying hey you know you have a huge following and you you can offer more you can offer your intellect you are a beautiful woman like but also you could you could give more of you offer your marketing skills offer something else this is to me a kind tweet saying we can all aspire to do better this is regenerative right she's basically saying this is kind of generate but you're capable of more but in response uh Kim wrote back let's all welcome Chloe Moretz to Twitter since no one knows who she is your nylon cover is cute boo what what like Okay so let's just attack this teenager at the time she might have been 20. I think I believe she was 19 was in 2016 and she's 25 today um let's attack her because she asked you to stop being a generator in the kindest possible terms ever right and then that wasn't enough to just say oh nobody knows who you are so I'm going to be fully frontal naked it wasn't enough for her to do that she then teamed up with Emily watch Jackowski who I told you was always naked and they were like yeah more power to us girls they're naked on the internet they teamed up and they both then posted this photo of them topless on the internet and they are giving the middle finger so it's an Fu to Chloe because like I don't know she asked you guys to stop being degenerate and this is uh so emblematic of the world that we live in today and by the way the newspapers the magazines they applauded Kim they quoted Kim and Emily for this action of like whoa slapped her down whoop slap down that morality whoa this girl tried to comment on degenerates and nope nope nope we are being degenerate out in the open we do not care like yes go us grown adult women who are both married and like who cares who is this who knows you boo who even knows who you are boo yeah that's where we are at I say we talk about generation why we talk about talk about Generation X but we now live in generation d D generates those are my thoughts on that okay so before we get into the headline of the day I want to talk to you about Bond charge formerly called Blue blocks they have rebranded and are now called Bond charge and they're a holistic Wellness brand with a huge range of products aimed at

transgender teacher who wore enormous prosthetic breasts underneath a tight t-shirt to class now if you're listening to this podcast I should just tell you this teacher is wearing a very bad wig um pink lipstick and the prosthetic breasts we're not talking about a size a or size B I don't this size if I had to guess this is like a size Z in breasts it's uh basically if your breasts were hitting your kneecaps you know that song do your ears hang low do they wobble to this could be this is the size of the prosthetic breasts that I am looking at and yeah that is Kayla Lemieux a manufacturing technology teacher at Oakville Trafalgar High School in Ontario and obviously this went viral because students took photos and videos of the teacher without his knowledge wearing these Prosthetics which is exactly what I would do actually if I was not with a child if I was with my child across the street because clearly this person is mentally Disturbed right people your act you're asking for a reaction Benjamin talks about this all the time you're doing something that is so outrageous only because you want people to react right it would be outrageous for any individual to have size z boobs and put on a tight fitting shirt and also I should say was wearing what looked like a small skirt and this teacher in the video that is shown that they took that they captured is sawing wood right bending over to saw some wood obviously this is completely inappropriate and crazy so you either take a video of it because it's so odd and you want to send it to your friend and say look at this complete and utter whack job that I just captured or you cross the street and make sure that it doesn't get anywhere near your children but nope this teacher is now in a high school so you would think that this High School had some standards and would tell this mentally Disturbed individual that despite your mental disturbance we are going to need you to dress professionally but note not only have they hired this individual uh much to the horror or fascination of their students they also in response to this video going viral of this crazy person only went viral because this is crazy right um the high school defended their employee yep the high school wrote to the parents and explained why they support Ms that's a lie pull your kids out they're telling them they can pick your gender why they support Ms lemuse gender expression ah gender expression that's a feel-good words compassionate I'm not going to call you crazy and out of your mind I'm going to call you gender expressive in a statement to parents the school said quote as a school within the Houghton District School Board Oakville High School recognizes the rights of students staff parents and Guardians and community members to Equitable treatment without discrimination based upon gender identity and gender expression we Thrive to promote a positive learning environment in schools consistent with the values of the hdsb and to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all students staff and the community regardless of race age ability sex gender identity gender expression sexual orientation ethnicity religion cultural observance socioeconomic circumstances or body type and or size this is a lot of words to say that they do not care if you are clearly demonstrating that you are out of your mind because they will hire you in fact this person was likely hired to show how open they are to crazy this is what it means to be a degenerate culture you have absolutely no standards and then you try to pretend that your standards are that their acceptance you know what I like discrimination when you're discriminating against crazy we're discriminating against bad when you're discriminating against people that have absolutely no moral compass right you do not you do not have a moral compass if you are choosing every single day to put on size Z Prosthetics and to go to wood shop and saw in front of children something's wrong with you okay there was something wrong with Kayla Lemieux but of course in a true Act of cowardice which is what we keep seeing across all school boards really they essentially say oh it's totally fine because all we want is people to think that we're open and we're accepting and parents should not accept this it is so abhorrent that these students have to walk into a classroom and to observe that every every day and are told that they're the problem but they think it's weird you're the problem if you're normal abnormal is now cool and abnormal so we're on board with this I would pull my child out of that classroom quickly actually I'd probably sue them I would sue the school board I would just say this is ridiculous this is abusive to my child it's abusive to the environment that my child is attempting to learn in and it is so maybe somebody in Canada get an idea next headline we have today is that there was a Wisconsin school district and this Wisconsin school district says that parents are ready not entitled to know their children's sexuality they are pushing also a heterosexual privilege list so there was a presentation at a teacher training for Eau Claire School District which told the school staff quote some transgender non-binary and or gender non-conforming students are not open at home for reasons that may include safety concerns or a lack of acceptance School Personnel should speak with the student first before discussing a student's gender non-conformity or transgender status with the student's parent or Guardian remember parents are not entitled to know their kids identities that knowledge must be earned end quote ladies and gentlemen I am certain that I am going to go to prison when my child goes I'm certain I am going to be arrested when my child goes to school because let me find out that teachers were distributed a list that says that I am not entitled to my child's identity I I am not entitled I don't know I just I don't held this child for 10 months I have fed this child I've clothed this child I have taken care of this child I have created this child my husband and I and you are now telling me I am not entitled to know my child's identity yes these absolute Freaks and pedophiles are coming after your children that's what they are right we are now priming the environment just so we're clear for pedophilia I've been saying this for years it starts with gender right oh it's a safe space right this is it's between you and I what happens this is stuff that you hear right this haunting sort of language where you talk about relationships between pedophiles and children don't tell your mom and dad right they're not entitled to know what takes place between you and I right I am someone outside of the safety of the home that is now telling you that actually you're more safe with me this is sick and every single person that is hearing this should be alarmed this is it's no longer acceptable for us not to be involved in every single thing that our child is learning at school because this is what's happening right they're now training teachers to think that this is normal behavior fortunately we have a lot of teachers that know how wrong this is It's why these stories often break out it's because there's a teacher that leaks it and says I don't even feel comfortable you're telling me that that these students are proprietary to me this is the language they use these are these are our kids right school districts believe that they believe that the children are theirs and that the parents at home are just inconvenient right establish that relationship outside of the home this is just the Department of Education fulfilling its long-term dreams remove parents right we're going to raise up your children in a way that we believe to be correct and right now that big government believes that children being confused about their gender helps them it supports their initiatives right it's this constant breakdown of family I'm talking about because that's what happens these kids get on puberty blockers now they're actually pushing for nurses to be able to diagnose your children and to potentially be able to start them on puberty blockers something that we know that wrecks their sexual functions so that we know that can lead to depression this is all beginning because of a school system A A system that is put in place to take power away from the parents is the scary stuff you guys and if that wasn't bad enough this same school also provided a white privilege test a white privilege test this is a amazing this is a test that went out um I think it goes out to students might be to the teachers as well but here it is and this is amazing because I think according to this test that I I have white privilege ready this is number one if I wish to I can arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time yeah of course you just called your friend you can have friends of whatever race you want you should just make friends number two I can be sure that no matter where I move to my neighbors in that location will be pleasant or neutral to me yeah no that's I definitely feel that way I can go shopping alone and be sure that I won't be followed or harassed yeah no I definitely I can do that I do that yeah I go to the store I can turn on the television open a newspaper and see people of my race widely represented yeah I know it definitely feels like today you almost have to be a minority to make it onto the screens all the talk show hosts all of the awards now they're like it's got to be a black person so I feel good about that I can speak in public to a powerful male group without putting my race on trial I literally have no idea what that even means but I'm gonna go ahead and check yes to that I don't why would my race be on trial if I spoke to a powerful male group also what is a powerful male group I have questions that I before I can even answer that accurately I am never asked to speak for my entire racial group now that's a definite check for me often I'm told you're not allowed to speak for black people Candace okay so a check I I have taken this test it appears that I have white privilege to you this is just the most ridiculous thing it's just again trying to brainwash people into believing that they're victims that every single thing that you that happens to you is some Act of aggression you can't even go to the grocery store that's what this test is telling you if you're black you can't even go to the grocery store you can't even move into a neighborhood without being judged that's what this test is telling you the white privilege test which I somehow have passed with flying colors I don't know how I did that I don't know I'm really smart I'm really really smart next headline you can hardly talk about degenerates without covering the story I just am so amazed by this model she's an Instagram model that's my favorite euphemism for uh I don't know a prostitute an Instagram model who claims she had a year-long affair with married Maroon 5 front man Adam Levine he's 43 and he asked her if he could name his unborn third child with supermodel Behati Prinsloo that's his wife after her okay so let's just watch the video that she posted to tick tock um to talk about the affair that she had I'm just gonna rip the band it off because I've retaken this like 10 times now essentially I was having an affair with a man who's married to a Victoria's Secret model at the time you know I was young I was naive and I mean quite frankly I feel exploited I wasn't in the scene like I am now um so I was definitely very easily manipulated Maroon 5 is practically elevator music at this point so I'm sure you know who Adam Levine is um but Adam and I were seeing each other for about a year after I stopped talking to him over you know a period of months this is uh how he came back into my life he said okay serious question I'm having another baby and if it's a boy I really uh want to name it Sumner you okay with that dead serious um I was like I'm in hell like I have to be in hell at this point I mean my morals were unknowingly compromised I was completely manipulated and healed this privately I never wanted to come forward because obviously I know the implications that come with doing what I do making money the way I do and being an Instagram model um so being tied to a story like this it's like I know the stereotypes I had sent um I'd send some screenshots recklessly to a few friends I thought I trusted and one of them had attempted to sell to a tabloid um so here I am she's an Instagram model guys quite frankly she feels exploited quite frankly she feels like like manipulated like I her morals were like unknowingly compromised she was object though Sumner's a victim like she didn't know like she's just like a girl like how was she supposed to know she's on the internet and she like I mean it's like elevator music Maroon 5 music and everybody clearly knows who Adam Levine is but she is the victim of the story don't you feel sad for her she had to go on Tick Tock and talk about how she wrecked a marriage and by the way I am not excusing Adam Levine from this I am just so fascinated by how degenerate your mind has to be in order for you to realistically obviously respond to the fact that somebody is Rich and Famous go for it because you're an Instagram model right hope that you're going to establish wish with him do this for an entire year and then publicly come out with this story not like you did the moral thing to do which would be if you really thought in reflection that you were doing something that was wrong you would reach out to his wife we would reach out to bahati Prinsloo who doesn't deserve this she's currently pregnant she has no idea clearly about this affair and she finds out on Tick Tock right if you are a moral individual to reached out to her and you said hey you know I am sorry for what I did I am sorry how what I have done and what I have contributed to hurt you yes I knew what I was doing clearly everybody knows who Adam Levine is everybody knows who Maroon 5 is if she was a moral person that's what she would have done nope she went on like Tech talk because like Tech talk I don't know I feel more like I feel exploited I'm the victim because I was young yeah you were desperate to establish a relationship with a famous rich man right prostitution is the oldest trade in the book and you did all of this knit you want us to feel bad for you Amber Heard because we're all so stupid that we're supposed to think oh Adam Levine just took advantage of you you didn't know what was going on of course you knew exactly what was going on this was supposed to be a trade right you were going to trade sex for a little bit of status it happens over and over and over again but I guess in the era of me too we're not allowed to say that too bad I just said that by the way Adam Levine really sucks that you would do this to somebody really sucks that you would do this to somebody who was pregnant and I can't even begin to unpack what kind of a psychosis you must be in to then say you want to name the child after someone that you are allegedly having an affair with but he did release this statement so I want to add it he said a lot is being said about me right now and I want to clear the air I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in any kind of flirtatious manner did not have an affair nevertheless I crossed the line during a regrettable period in my life in certain instances it became an appropriate appropriate I have addressed that and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family my wife and my family is all I care about in this world to be this naive and stupid enough to risk the only thing that truly matters to me was the greatest mistake I could ever make I will never make it again I take full responsibility we'll get through it and we will get through it together okay um sure I'm glad that you're offering a public apology but it kind of feels a bit moot you know as I said bahati Prinsloo is pregnant this is a terrible terrible thing for any woman to have the supper while she's pregnant and yeah you had terrible judgment whether you had an affair or not goes back to what we said earlier right if you are engaging in online behavior that you would not engage in in real life you are guilty right it is not just an act of infidelity when it happens in the real world virtual oh online I'm flirting with this Instagram model and she's obviously a disgusting human being but it shouldn't matter it does matter be better stop separating yourself from your behavior online that's all I have to say about that another story which I have very little to say about because it speaks for itself and it just it breaks my heart in a way that black culture has come to this in fact one of my favorite things and my favorite things I mean least favorite things that people say to me is you know because you don't represent Black Culture this is what they say you don't understand Black Culture you don't know Black Culture when we see these images of girls twerking on the screen constantly wearing thongs when we see people like cardi B performing and being I mean just completely debasing what it means to be a black woman right when we see this and say Candace you don't know you don't understand Black Culture nope um I don't know why you think this is Black Culture I don't um I don't know who led you to believe that this is all black culture had to represent I don't know why you don't understand how degenerative black culture has become because when I was growing up I was growing up with the Temptations I was watching things like Family Matters this is not what Black Culture from was when I was growing up this wasn't the age in the 90s our families were together we had values we had faith we believed in God we believed in our families today none of those things right we're just celebrating promiscuity we're celebrating unity and somebody along the lines convinced us that it's ours that celebrating rap culture which promotes gun violence and gangs and death and murder is ours it's not ours I refuse to accept it so when you tell me I don't know it's good I don't want to know it I want nothing to do with that I want to be part of the regenerative culture I want to be a part of the people that believe and know that black Americans have more to contribute so I want to get to this story because I think it really underscores what I'm saying we have a female rapper I don't even care to say her name um and she says in a video that she has murder on her mind as she twerks in front of Planned Parenthood take a listen [Music] [Applause] baby daddy on my way to the clinic I forgot the plan B let's go I honestly like we we have to stop we have to stop I I can't we just let's just stop it there on the way to plan on the way to the clinic I got I got Murder on My Mind do I mean do you I do you have words I don't have them I really I don't have them and I am waiting for someone that feels that they are a better representation of Black Culture to speak out against this to recognize what it means when Planned Parenthood right is now getting exposure from black women that are half naked outside the same plan Planned Parenthood which as we have mentioned before on the show and as we will continue to mention Ad nauseam because facts and history matter that was created to stop black people from procreating now we have lizzo promoting Planned Parenthood now we have this rapper promoting Planned Parenthood making a mockery of the 18 million plus black American children that were killed inside of their mother's womb you want to know where the most unsafe place is for a black child that's not on the streets it's in their mother's wombs and it's because our culture is rotten our culture is training us to believe that we should be celebrating this immorality it is Despicable maybe somebody should join me in Having the courage to say it that's all I have to say about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on Biden's recent 60 Minutes interview and Meghan markle's tears for the queen so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description

maybe on a school bus if you're on it people right on the back of school bus seats you know uh Connecticut for life if you're from Connecticut there's something about it that is so childish that it drives me insane and I see more and more of it in American society where people are naming things that sound like hashtags that's something you might see on Tick Tock and I get frustrated about it", "6UmS1sO7BMs": "imagine that there are people that have been put to death and they actually didn't commit the crime the science wasn't even good in the forensic weren't even good enough back in the day to be able to determine whether people had committed crimes it was very much a whodunit it might have been him and they were sentencing people also now you think okay well that sort of stuff wouldn't happen today sometimes people were literally sentenced just because of the color of their skin because our government was so judgmental and hated people and when we have a political system that is as rotten as it is today I don't really want politicians and judges who are bought and paid for having the ability to make these sorts of decisions I really don't I think especially after January 6th I just I'm not in support of it I don't support the death penalty I know that that is something that people disagree with as you have done but I don't think that I could ever I don't think that it is right for us to think that we should judge whether a non-individual should live I think that you leave it to God", "LtR7A0CalGQ": "all right guys we got to get to the topic of foreign politics you and i were obviously tweeting about the dilemma in russia today and i thought let's talk about it but then i realized that there was already an expert on the matter that was speaking on it cardi b has weighed in yes on so i'm gonna have to ask everyone to be silent as cardi b explains what is going on with russia a fan asked her for her opinion about the russia ukraine debacle and it's excellent and she's gonna give it to us now the phone is not hacked it's really me i actually want to say a lot of things but i'm just going to mind my business because sometimes i feel like i have such a big platform that if i say if i don't say the right things i might get killed but i'm really not on nato's side i'm really not in russian side i'm actually in the citizen side because at the end of the day the world is having a crisis right now there's inflation not only in america but everywhere in the world it's really hard to get um the economy back up there is so much shipments and embarkments backed up china's not really messing with us so a lot of things are behind a lot of goods are behind and this just made it way more complicated so i'm just really annoyed by this and i really wish that all world leaders right now just really come with a logical conclusion but whatever you know means well right i think she really wants to understand doesn't understand at all what's happening because this is i mean this is a woman that sat down with joe biden and told all of her fans to vote for him and she's talking about inflation and things that are bad this is what i this is the problem that i have with celebrities weighing in on issues that they have no idea what they're talking about because they just become very easy to use and to delude many people to vote because they just go oh i like her music so therefore this must be a good candidate you're right but also at the same time still more coherent than kamala harris on the issue yeah i would agree well now wait a second i was going to say actually that let's let's trust the experts now kamala harris this is a direct quote here we go i saw this first as a jack tweet and i thought he was being funny reporter well sanctions deter putin allegedly from jack i don't know if we can trust him but he says that she says quote within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening all though open although it is absolutely narrowing but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open now he says actual quote i don't believe it is let's cut to some footage to see if that's what she really said and within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening all the open although it is absolutely narrowing but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open the deterrence effect we believe has merit those are words okay of our time those are those are a lot of words and it's exactly what she said so point to jack yes i'm going to have to agree team cardi b on this one i thought it was much more it was just much more easy to understand this is just the nonsense and why i say america is just no longer being taken seriously on the world stage because we don't have a coherent leader like when cardi b starts making more sense than joe biden and kamala harris we're in a bad circumstance yeah we've been there for a minute too it's not like this is all of a sudden a new thing we were talking about russia a month ago on this show and just how incoherent our leaders are on the subject we have no idea who to trust we don't know if we can trust the pentagon we don't know if we can trust our commander-in-chief we certainly don't know if we can trust russia we don't even know if we can trust nato these days we have absolutely no idea where citizens are being protected and being advocated for so on that issue i actually kind of do agree with cardi b i never thought those words would ever come out of my mouth but i think she really is starting to think okay who is actually advocating for people she says she's on the side of citizens that's a fair question to ask because i don't think we have a logical coherent answer as the american people right now whether our government is actually advocating for us but can i just say wouldn't it be phenomenal if joe biden worked as hard as that filter was working for cardi b i know that video i know i i just wish so much that we had people in washington who knew how to say a sentence or tie their shoes but i feel like every time i turn around i'm watching a sitcom of what politicians look like on television i don't know if you've ever seen the show veep but it's very very similar to that yeah it's so weird like it is absolutely insane we're living in a simulation that's my my take 40 years ago ronald reagan saw massive inflation unlike anything the country had ever seen before until today in reagan's own words inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hitman right now your retirement accounts are under attack thanks to the inflationary policies of this administration if you have not yet called birch gold then

Wednesday ladies and gentlemen all right straight to my question of the day and it's have you ever had an encounter with the morality police think about that plus upcoming we have an escort that went

all right you probably figured why I asked you that question how have you had an encounter with the morality police the reasons are because of a story which has gone viral as it should regarding a circumstance that took place in Iran the Iranian government in response has blocked mobile internet and all social media apps following protests against the death of Masa amini who was Masa amini Masa amini was a 22 year old young lady who was arrested by Iran's morality police yes that is a thing the moral police of Iran they arrested her for allegedly violating their strict dress code for women which requires that women wear a hijab and clothing that covers both their arms and their legs in public remember Iran is a theocracy amini was allegedly beaten after her arrest and she later died following a three-day coma all of this because she was not wearing the correct garments it is first and foremost a horrific tragedy and it sends a chill down everyone's spines and the fact that they are now blocking internet access makes it especially extreme because people are understandably outraged this could possibly take place in 2022 but let me say this these sorts of headlines used to really shock me I'm sure you as well you're probably thinking how on Earth could this happen and we would probably say in our minds because I don't know it's a third world country it's a theocracy uh this could never happen in America not the home of the brave and the land of the free America rah-rah Raj So Different Here it almost feels like it can only happen in an ancient world but I'm challenging you to like me see this through a different lens because suddenly I'm realizing when I read these headlines they feel a lot closer I no longer have this sense that this could never happen here because it has happened here because it is happening here don't let our media allow you to forget what took place and what still is taking place depending on where you live during the covid era the covid couple of years where people lost their minds when America in my opinion became a theocracy right covid was among other things a religion don't forget the government was getting on the airwaves and telling you oh no no no no you you cannot have too many people at your Thanksgiving oh no no no you absolutely cannot go see your loved one in the hospital if you were like me and you were pregnant during those times you were told that you couldn't bring your loved ones to any appointment and you were actually concerned as to whether or not your husband was going to be allowed in the room when you gave birth for many people the answer was no by the way because we were committed to an ideology we were committed to this idea of fear fear became a religion in America and the moral police assembled remember all those videos circulating online you see people walking through the park without a mask and some crazed woman would come up behind them a crazed person and say you're not wearing a mask you would hear the stories of people that were having 9-1-1 called on them because they had too many people at their house so they're sitting around with grandpa and grandma but oh don't forget your Morrow police had already decided that was too many people you were going to spread the virus you had people that were being chased down in grocery stores I was one of them because you were walking in the wrong direction I'll never forget Whole Foods they had these sticker pads all over the floor saying that you needed to walk in a certain direction down the aisles six feet apart as you picked up your groceries God forbid you forgot something in the aisle there was no turning around you had to start back at the beginning because you could only go in One Direction if you accidentally turned around or if you purposely like I did turned around because you forgot something the morrow police assembled hey hey you're not allowed to walk in that direction Whole Foods of course now we know there was no science behind that because they just you know took them away the virus never went away just you know the rules went away as Biden said famously a couple of weeks ago covet is over the pandemic is over because the government decided that it was over let's take a look back actually at this one video of one such encounter that happened during coven this is a woman that is being chased down by a man because he doesn't like the way she's wearing her mask take a listen does it bother anybody else that she doesn't have to wear a mask that we all do just go away stay six feet away from me then no get away from me no Securities yeah please get away from me right now no you don't need to come near me get away from me you don't care leave me alone get out of here kudos to that woman at the end who stands up and says leave her alone someone who recognizes the insanity of a man chasing down a woman pretending that he's afraid of a virus clearly he's not if he was fearful of covid he obviously wouldn't have been chasing her which is why she says keep your six feet if you are so committed to this religion then you should be staying away from me six feet away from me because you're convinced that this virus is something that's going to jump to you clearly he's not afraid he's just of course respecting the religion of covid and he needs her to also respect the religion of covid that is what the morality police did and that is what they are doing in our society maybe in the future it'll be towards some other religion like environmentalism right maybe we'll have people chasing other people down for not using the right straws all of it is feasible in today's society I take a look at what's going on in Iran and I think my goodness shutting down the internet social media apps oh that could never happen in America except it could and it did they were called fact Checkers that was the manner in which they shut down conversation and they shut down the internet don't oh but it was for your safety the fact Checkers had to assemble and tell you that everyone was lying except for them right people that perhaps said hey I got the covid shot and I don't feel too good liars women that were saying I got the moderna vaccine and I have not had regular menstruation since Liars temporarily of course they changed their minds down the line people that were having their teenagers submit to the coveted vaccine and saying that they suffered heart problems Liars until yeah no they did have to acknowledge that the covid vaccine did in fact cause myocarditis but they weren't willing to tell you early on because I don't know whoever's running this religion our government of course decided that that information wasn't necessary because they needed everyone to submit their arms so we had religious garments and we had these religious acts these sacraments if you will that were created by our government and big Pharma yeah so no this Iran headlined these headlines that are going on it's not so far away from here and then of course something that I recognized in reading all of this is that there is a dark humor in it all and I want to emphasize the word dark because of course this young woman is actually dead and there's nothing funny about that but think about the fact that American women still think that we're the ones that are oppressed and we are in my opinion we're oppressed with stupidity remember just last week by the way Emily rajakowski the one that's always naked on the internet but always telling you about how we're oppressed famously got on the airwaves to say um yeah it's not fair that we attack women for sleeping with other people's husbands here's what she said remember it's sexism it's classic misogyny it sucks it's almost classic misogyny I mean she's so embodies everything that is wrong with American society the most privileged people in the entire world still convinced that we are the ones that are oppressed what is happening in Iran right now should resonate with all of you as a stunning rebuke of our own Society and that's all I have to say about that okay before we continue I want to take a quick pause to talk to you about the app hallow you all know that my faith is super important to me my relationship with God is how I find my strength and peace in this crazy world with all of the

for three months free at hello.com Candace that's hello.com Candace reclaim your piece and download hello today okay now it's time for some topics to show [Music] ladies and gents you know like I know that women in the western world are suffering and the reasons why well I could tell you but I think it's better that Emily rajkowski tells you it's sexism it's classic misogyny it is it is what can I say it sexism it's a classic misogyny jumping into this first headline there is a woman in Sydney her name is Bianca Sierra and she went viral on Tick Tock after sharing some of the most common reasons that men with wives and children choose to see her so to be clear she's an escort and here's what she has to say learned being an escort sleeping with people's husbands um you can do better you can do more for you he's just doing it with other women he's comfortable you let him be comfortable he loves the kids and he doesn't want the kids taken away and that's one of the main reasons why he's staying these kind of men need carers nine times out of ten day the irresponsible parent and you're the responsible one they need someone to hold them down at home so they can go out and be crazy and do all the things they want to do and then come home to you because they know that you've got their back and they need that grounding I'm not saying that this woman deserves to be punched in the face but I am saying that if she was punched in the face I wouldn't be saying anything about it I mean what a horrible horrible example of what it means to be a woman in the western Society right a woman that's living amongst Western principals not only is she going to sleep with your man as an escort but she's also going to jump on Tick Tock and get millions of views and tell you why she's sitting with your man right that that is an example of the western world today it's like I can get attention and I can get likes and I can get clicks because I'm not just going to be a horrible person behind the scenes but now it pays to be horrible in front of the scenes you know what it reminds me of I had this discussion with a young man who he's actually English but he grew up in Saudi Arabia and he was telling me I was basically asking him like oh my gosh what's it like to grow up in Saudi Arabia it must be so crazy a theocracy what a crazy backwards Society so Antiquated and what he remarked to me was that yes it is Extreme living under a theocracy but he said that Saudi Arabia was actually quite a nice place and there was never any crimes because it was so extreme there were no crimes he's like when you live in a society and they will cut your arms off for stealing nobody steals he said the Western world is the opposite extreme there's no consequences for anything so there's crime everywhere right I mean what This Woman's essentially doing to me represents a crime she's just ruining families left and right doesn't care doesn't have to have morality because we've gone so far to the Other Extreme that we live in a society that has absolutely no consequences for your actions in fact we live in a society that will reward you for your bad behavior and so she's garnered not only millions of likes but she will get thousands of followers for being a disgusting human being next story that we have up speaking of Oppression could you imagine if you were a woman and you were in Walmart really honestly think about this go into Walmart and you see a line and you decide to cut the line and then imagine that a man comes up to you and says hey you are not allowed to cut the line what a horrible horrible predicament that would be being a woman that has to actually respect a lion in Walmart Listen to This Woman's response this man by the way shared this video that he just simply asked her he said I just asked her if she somehow didn't see the line of people that she had just cut at the register and this was actually the woman's response take a listen I didn't touch you man did that is this a prank again he won't go away [Music] I still got I still got okay she threw some of my stuff oh hell if I know I'm so sorry well she wasn't sorry when she cut in line yeah you to make it oh I just asked her if she saw anyone in line I just cannot get enough of that scream it's unbelievable it is unbelievable first off that Walmart employee deserves a raise she's just trying to manage this situation this woman is having a full down breakdown a full-on breakdown because a man is telling her hey did you not see the line you just cut a bunch of people and somehow of course because we are obsessed with victimization rather than saying like a normal human being oh I'm sorry actually I didn't see the line and removing yourself and allowing him in front she has decided to revert herself into a scenario where she was raped she starts off by saying I was raped I can't deal with another man right as if it's somehow his fault because he wants to check out in Walmart and then she begins to scream in an octave that I can tell you I've never ever ever in my life been able to hit that octave this woman is beyond a soprano I mean she is screaming in a way that I've never heard children scream at a playground and she's having a meltdown because now she's realized well I'm a woman right so I'm going to make this somehow a sex crime in Walmart it's now a sex crime that I am not allowed to cut the line that I didn't see here we are again in a society where there are no consequences where everything can be classic misogyny and classic sexism right it is ridiculous and I'm so glad that he posted this video because it also shows just the neuroticism that has that all American women seem to have these leftist women there's they're neurotic right they're constantly looking for the next scenario in which they can claim that they're a victim here's my thing I am very very sad for this woman if she actually was raped I have a lot of questions about that it seems like something she just said but I'm not going to victim blame her maybe she actually was raped two days ago but if she was and this is the result she shouldn't be out in public she's obviously not mentally stable enough to be in public and I don't know if it needs to be said but even if you did go through a sexual assault it does not then Grant you the right to cut men in line everywhere out in society at least of all Walmart the line is always exceptionally long so I really got to take this man's side jumping in to the next headline of the week we have PornHub a bunch of women sex workers over at PornHub are upset because if you did not hear this Instagram took off the PornHub account and they said that they were in violation of their rules repeatedly well these women have stood up and these sex workers men and women alike have stood up and they said wait a second Instagram tolerates racy pictures from celebrities like Kim Kardashian while they unfairly censor the porn industry the group accused Instagram in a letter on Tuesday of quote violent and profoundly damaging and quote harm to the porn industry by selectively enforcing its content moderation rules though Instagram insists that it was PornHub that is to blame because they were violated the rules repeatedly now I have to say this I actually am going to be for the first time team PornHub on this you probably heard me in last week's episodes um talking about the pornography industry and making people realize that porn is actually everywhere right we're just deciding as they as they said which standard of porn we're willing to accept yes Kim Kardashian posts nude photos all the time barely covering her nipples barely covering her private parts and somehow it's allowed to stand last week we also covered that strange photo the photos that Madonna posts on Instagram where she is basically naked she's in fishnet she's wearing a thong she's under her bed she has her full fake ass in the air because she got I decided at the age of 63 years old she decided that she needed to get butt implants and all that's allowed on Instagram it's allowed as long as you don't show the nipple you can put whatever pornography that you basically want Instagram so why come down on the sex workers who don't make as much money as the billionaire Kardashians who don't make as much money as Madonna why are we coming down there needs to either be a real standard right or there should be no double standards we just need to have a real standard to not allow pornography on the internet so I'm interested to see where that's going to go obviously we know where it's going to go Kim Kardashian will be protected Madonna will be protected and these sex workers will have to face consequences this next story is unbelievable it's one of my favorite categories of leftist insanity it's cultural appropriation where people get offended for everything you can just log on to the internet and you can see a girl braiding her hair and then you can go cultural appropriation you did not give credit to some tribe in Africa that invented the braid I don't know what tribe that was but people get upset from hairstyles nowadays honestly they'll say you stole that from Jamaican culture you stole that from African culture you stole that from insert whatever culture and unless you properly accredit whatever you do you can be in trouble if you're white I can do whatever I want it's great I love being black but if you're white you are not allowed to do that which is why Haley Bieber that is Justin Bieber's wife she is a model got in some into into very real trouble for using a ready a certain shade of lipstick she got in so much trouble that Good Morning America did a full segment on the cultural appropriation of her lipstick shade take a listen now we're going to go to our GMA cover story Haley Bieber facing backlash the supermodel getting heat after sharing a makeup look on Tick Tock with some users causing the look cultural appropriation Jeffrey Ramos had the details good morning Stephanie Michael good morning Haley Bieber doesn't claim to have invented this particular lip combo in her video the brown lip liner and the clear lip gloss but that post about that combo led to an influx of tick tock users recreating the look on the platform and crediting Bieber as their inspiration others calling it cultural appropriation this morning supermodel Haley Bieber facing backlash after sharing her new lip routine on Tick Tock with the caption ready for all the fall things including brownie glazed lips the now viral post causing a wave of criticism social media users calling out the supermodel claiming she is culturally appropriating the makeup routine using dark lip liner and clear lip gloss a popular style from the late 80s and 90s I know that that lip combo is not Haley Bieber lips it is a Latina and black woman live combo the issue is when something is sort of presented as if it's something new when it's a practice that has been around for decades and decades African-American and Latino women get denigrated for the ways that they present their body the way they weigh their hair people use words like ghetto or ratchet or that have these identities to denigrate women it was ghetto it was trashy it was not cute many pointing out that the lip style was accepted when a white woman did it but not when a woman of color did because if that would be me in high school here in the Midwest I would have gotten so much shame for that I just want to know what high school she went to that she would have gotten so much shame for that and by the way I love that during this segment they say this is a trend from the late 80s yeah Haley Bieber wasn't alive she is so young that she was not alive in the late 80s and the early 90s I mean just could you imagine just putting on lipstick and causing so much backlash that you actually warrant an entire segment on Good Morning America over something that ridiculous as putting the color brown on your lips with some lip gloss by the way I used to have this girlfriend of mine she was Irish she was obviously white blonde hair hazel eyes best friends growing up and we used to go to Claire's and go to CVS this is the land before Tick Tock and Instagram and Facebook right so we were allowed to just I don't know put Brown lip liner on with lip gloss and be dropped off at middle school and nope we didn't get any shame nope we were just kids trying on weird trends that we made up all by ourselves little did we know that had we have done that during the time of peak stupidity in America that we would have been in a lot of trouble that we would have gotten shame black Americans being shamed my mother wears these I don't know what anybody is talking about I've never ever ever thought that I had to attribute something to anything other than it looked good but of course as we know today women in America are oppressed and we know the reasons why tell us again Emily tell us again it's sexism it's classic misogyny it is I find everything that Haley Bieber did to be a classic um misogyny moving on you guys I have breaking news from my orthodontist if you guys didn't know I actually got you might be able to hear it a little bit when I speak I got a full set of braces on my bottom row to correct a tooth now you're probably thinking Candace why are you telling us this that's quite personal we don't need to know what's going on in your mouth well I have to tell you because somebody else already told you yeah a young woman that had to suffer sharing space with me in the waiting room at the orthodontist went on to tick tock to tell a story about how she saw Candace Owens at the orthodontist and this video has racked up almost 1.5 million views she did a little series on Tick Tock which you can take a look at I will read you the captions if you are listening it says not Candace Owens sitting right next to me at the orthodontist gonna pretend that I'm a fan and ask for a pick and then she posts a picture of us together because she did come up to me but because 1.4 million people were just so amazed that she pretended to be a fan and get a picture they asked her to further explicate the incident because again this is breaking news Candace Owens goes to the orthodontist and here is a video of her detailing her harrowing encounter so I've been getting a lot of questions about what exactly happened and what did I say to her but there really isn't much of a story um I was leaving the orthodontist after getting my Invisalign buttons off and I saw her sitting across as I was like getting my Uber and I like did a double take I was like there's no way that's Candace Owen I did a double take she was sitting next to this white woman who I'm pretty sure is her like assistant or whatever and so like I did a double take and then I like ran out of the room and I called my sister and I was like Gabby you're not gonna believe who's right who was right there it was Candace oh she was like there's no way there's no way she's like I don't know and I was like oh my gosh that's crazy she's like you should take a picture with her and I was like what she's like you should pretend to be a fan and take a picture with her and I was like I don't think I could do that girl but she dared me to so I did to her I wasn't sure if I like wanted to fix my hair I keep my glasses on because these are kind of giving like liberal like come on but I kept my glasses on and then I went up to her and then I looked at her again and I think I gave her an RBF but I didn't mean to and yeah I said oh hi are you Candace Owens and she like looked up and smiled she's like I am and then I said like oh my gosh I'm a huge fan of your work or no I said I really admire your work and she was like oh you do really thank you and I said do you mind if we could take a picture together and she said yes and I shook her hand and I introduced myself I was like hi I'm Tony and we took a picture and her little white assistant was like cheese in I was like okay girl let's let's chill but like overall she was really nice she was really pretty um very very pretty like in real life like she was like she was eaten at the orthodontist like come on but I didn't want to post that video because um I didn't want her to see it because I knew if I posted it it would get attention and it did um because to be honest like you know she's an actual human being and like I don't condone on the internet but I thought it would be funny so I did also for everyone complimenting my teeth thank you just got five visit line all day thank you okay that's all I gotta say yeah that's um breaking news in today's world you guys Candace Owens is a human being I was I was shocked I was shocked when this video made explain to me I can't believe it I can't believe Candace Owens is a human being I also can't believe that she was able to stretch a correspondence that took about three seconds in to a two minute video that has garnered millions of you I just that's actually the most important point that I want you to take away that our society has become so remarkably privileged that millions of people have nothing else better to do than to watch this Encounter of me sitting in the orthodontist waiting room being a kind individual and taking a picture also I don't appreciate the shade that's thrown at my assistant okay imagine if my assistant got onto Tick Tock and was like this black girl was

[Music] thank you", "MSz_z-2Cd8g": "happy Thursday everyone and I am actually having a very happy Thursday because unless you've been hiding under a rock you know that we premiered the greatest lie ever sold my documentary exploring the black lives matter movement and it couldn't have gone off more perfectly I'm just so grateful for all of you that tuned in live and for those of you that I know will watch when you can I'd like to start this episode actually with a quote of the day a quote that was featured in my documentary that quote is the media is the most powerful entity on Earth they have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent and that's power because they control the minds of the masses it was Malcolm X that said that and I want to lean into that idea on today's episode plus I would like to respond to an article that ran in TMZ this morning which has my blood absolutely boiling all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] thank you so the premiere went off without a hitch it was absolutely amazing it was great to have all of my friends be a part of it we had a lot of Warriors cultural Warriors as I would say that attended we had Brittany Aldean as you know she notoriously stood up to the trans agenda and caught a lot of heat within country music that is the wife of Jason Aldean he also attended I think my favorite part of the evening was getting Kid Rock and Kanye West talking outside of the venue they just had a total Vibe about themselves everyone was in amazing Spirits we also had the Entertainer Ray J there just a ton of people that are support more importantly my family and I just want to express and I'm going to give you guys the speech that I gave on stage I just want to express my gratitude that I continually have an audience of people who listen to and support me and who respond to me who give me good feedback who allow me to grow who understand this most important mission for the future a future which we need to determine for the sake of our children my children and it's the reason that I fight I had an amazing team around me last night family around me and I guess I just want to give you guys that behind the scenes listen to what I said when I entered the stage take a listen thank you so much I'm honored to be here I am honored to be able to speak out and eulogize the black lives matter movements the life and the death of an organization that tore this country apart what can we say about black lives matter well the first thing that I would say is that we all know that it has been a scam it has been a scam that is essentially operated with a figurative gun to every single American's head it is a scam that Finds Its basis in stupidity people posting black squares is a my favorite moment I think from the black lives matter movement demanding that every single person posts a black Square to prove that they weren't racist this documentary was one of the most important things for me to make and there's a ton of people in this room that I need to thank for this moment and bringing this to the public but it was important for me to make because it is really the story of the media it was Malcolm X that warned us of the media's power how it can make friends your enemies and enemies your friends how it can tell you to hate someone overnight and we essentially get in line the media truly is the most powerful entity on Earth and there was no greater example of that in my lifetime than the George Floyd story we decided to name it the greatest lie ever sold because what the media is in the business of is selling lies selling lies to people in their households and getting people to hate one another this story was personal to me because when I went out into the public sphere and I interjected just a little bit of Truth which you guys are going to see I was castigated not only by the media but by my own black peers I was told that I wasn't allowed to say the truth about who and what George Floyd was because the victim narrative felt too good and people had become so comfortable in being the victim and being treated like the victim I believe honestly that what we are seeing in America is an entire group of people that are being trained to race to the bottom people are fighting to be oppressed people want to be able to jump on board and accuse one another of oppressing constantly what I was talking to about with my friend yay is that we are very quickly arriving in a trauma economy where people want to constantly pretend to be traumatized by various instances and what it's ultimately doing is it's weakening all of us it's weakening all of our relationships with one another and I think the greatest thing is that it's weakening our relationship with God we exist together as one nation under God right it's important to say under God not beside God not on top of God not above God but under God and what this culture has become largely has been an Atheist culture and I can talk to you about how they did it to Black America and it's important to understand the story of Black America because if Black America was the experiment in understanding how you could sell trauma to a group of people then right now they are running that experiment on all human beings across the globe focusing on Black America First and seeing what happens to a group of individuals that buys the victim narrative that believes that they can be nothing else but oppressed they never get ahead in their lives they never at the top of companies and they are consistently told that it's because of racism and not because they have no belief in themselves I want to obviously allow you guys to watch documentaries so I don't want to say too much other than to first and foremost thank God I had the most liberal route to conservatism and I grew up in an incredibly religious household and I resented that when I became a teenager and throughout my college Years I resented that and I became a more secular individual convinced that atheism was the past the path for me but I now realize that and by destroying that pillar of Faith in American society every other ill has followed when we talk about why it is that we have so many black Americans that can't read and so many black Americans that can't get ahead it's because after they destroyed the god pillar they went after families it is why the topic of broken families is not a joke it is not a joke people will tell you the incarceration rates that face black men but they won't communicate to you how many of those black men grew up without a father in a home the denigration of men that we are seeing in society with movements like me too with movements like time's up fraudulent movements that are actually around just to disempower manhood and to make manhood obsolete let me tell you there is no country and there is no household within a country that can survive without strong men we need men but the radicalized feminist movement is teaching us the exact opposite it is teaching us that women can do it all by themselves and that to Aspire to family and to Aspire to children and to Aspire to being a CEO as women are in their households is something that should be looked down upon it is because they destroyed family and it's because Black America has a 74 single motherhood rate that we are seeing these individuals turn to culture naturally because the government knows that if there's not a mom and a dad sitting around the dinner table then those kids are going to pursue maternity and paternity elsewhere that elsewhere tends to be the streets that elsewhere tends to be when they put on their headphones and they listen to hip-hop music and suddenly they are emulating the people that they see on their screens and on TV shows aspiring to that lifestyle and not aspiring to something better the last pillar beyond faith and beyond family that we have to talk about is the education system which is systematically teaching children to be dumb and to be emotional so that they can use narratives like the black lives matter narrative to inspire them to go outside and to act like fools and that obviously is a pillar that many people in this room have been fighting and it is the ultimate fight because we are what we are fighting for is for our children to know the truth and you understand that of course in this room we represent counter culture we did this counter-cultural thing by talking about God and talking about families for whatever reason that is against the stream the mainstream if you will media but the most important thing is to make sure that we fight for the future of our children they cannot survive in this world that's really it beyond that I thanked my incredible team which made this documentary possible I mean I just can't express to you enough how grateful I am and truly that's all I have to say about that okay before we continue I want to take a quick pause to talk to you about the app hallow you all know that my faith is super important to me my relationship with God is how I find my strength and peace in this crazy world and with all of the insane anti-religious ideologies that are being pushed I have a left on a daily basis it can be hard to tune out the noise remember what we know is good and true which is why I love hallow hallow is the number one Christian Prayer app in the United States the number one Catholic app in the world it's rooted in the Catholic tradition but an amazing resource for any Christian looking to dive deeper

the same for you try it for three months free at hello.com Candace that's hello.com Candice reclaim your peace and download hello today okay let's get into some topics to show [Music] so the theme of today's episode and also of my documentary is the media the media deceptions how the media is able to orchestrate a plot line against an individual and make you hate that individual essentially overnight they just decide what the plot line is going to be and they tell lies and I want to lay into that by just taking you through a situation that happened last night so at around 2 51 PM just ahead of my documentary Premiere event I received an email from the New York Post and they said we're here in Candace has been making calls on Kanye's behalf by the way this email went to the pr team here at the daily wire we're here in Candace has been making calls on Kanye's behalf and is working for him now as an advisor she is a part of a team that he is trying to build that will help him launch his presidential campaign for 2024. she has been a key enabler in him pushing his white lives matter message do you want to comment I can be reached at blank please let me know if there's someone else I should be reaching out to thank you I appreciate it actually getting this email because this means that they actually tried to execute some journalism and see whether or not the person that was clearly trying to plant the story was lying or whether or not there was any ferocity to the claims and I responded forcefully and quickly that this entire thing is complete and utter BS this morning I woke up and another iteration of that appeared in TMZ TMZ ran with this headline and they only reached out it turned out we were trying to figure out who they reached out to they reached out to an old email address of mine that has not been working since 2018 and yet despite reaching out to that they were in full communication with my team they know who the pr team is at the daily wire they sent a photog to last night's event so they intentionally did not want me to be able to respond at all to the email they did not want me to be able to respond and they instead wanted to write the email to lie to the masses and I'm going to tell you something right up front Okay because I'm very Furious about this article that TMZ ran the headline is Kanye West in constant talks with Candace Owens friends believe she's influencing him so let me tell you how TMZ is influenced I know for a fact because I've been in the room when this has happened to don't forget I've been friends with Kanye for years I've been around him and Kim when they were married and nobody cared that me and him were friends and they weren't trying to pollute our friendship or make it seem like he's having a mental breakdown every time he's around me before all that happened I've been around and in the room when this family the Kardashians Kanye when he was with the Kardashians can pick up the phone and they can call Harvey Levin Harvey Levin I don't know how to say his last name and they can just call him and talk to him about articles that they want run okay this is a PR marketing machine there is a relationship between TMZ a direct relationship between TMZ and the Kardashian family okay so my Spidey senses are a little up because this article is very much written in the vein that Kim Kardashian is a saint and be careful because evil Candace is polluting Kanye's mind so I'm going to read you just some aspects from this article which they intentionally did not want me to be able to respond to they write turns out Kanye West and Candace Owens didn't just decide to wear their white lives matter shirts on a whim the two have been planning it for weeks oh that's an absolute lie just flat out a complete and utter lie in fact I posted a photo of me having the shirt stitched live what is the truth and if we wanted to reveal the truth by the way uh I think everybody knows by now following the Taylor Swift and Kanye West and Kim Kardashian beef that Kanye keeps a videographer with him almost at all times and he certainly had a videographer with him at his show the truth is that I showed up in Paris and I barely made it to a show he asked me to be there within about a 48-hour window before the show actually was going to take place so I packed up myself really quickly and I got on a plane I made it to Paris within hours of his show okay so the idea of this was somehow planned is ridiculous when I showed up he had two different shirts and he was thinking that he might want me to wear one was black and did not say White lives matter instead had a picture on the front the second one was the shirt that you saw me wearing he said which one which one do you think you should wear I said it's your show what do you want me to wear and he picked the White lives matter one obviously I know exactly what he's trying to apply AI White lives matter it's obvious black lives matter is a scam to tearing the nation apart white people feel like they have been left out of the conversation and have been treated like there's something wrong with them because of the color of their skin okay we're not defeating racism we're recreating racism in this country I have the courage to say that Kanye has the courage to say that Kanye has the courage to turn that into an artistic expression but now of course I don't know whoever's planting the story feels to me like a little Kim Kardashian attack I'm gonna be honest with you I know how this family operates and they decide to make it smoke this was all my idea right like as if I could influence Kanye's fashion show are you crazy did nobody see the episode of the Kardashians early on when he made Kim throughout her entire wardrobe because he didn't want her dressed in these old hurray Legend dresses and wanted her to instead wear updated fashion which turned her into the fashion icon that people consider her to be today that was Kanye's doing he's a Visionary there's no Candace Owens getting into his brain saying oh here's what we should do with your show it's insulting to him as an artist artists to even pretend that this was my idea it's so insulting to him but let me carry on and tell you how I really feel with some of Kanye's friends some of Kanye's former friends right because with friends like these you're talking TMZ who needs enemies some of Connie's former friends telling us she's acting as his chief advisor in his day-to-day life right completely ridiculous what does that even mean a chief advisor what am I advising him to do do you actually think that every day I go here's what I advise you do you think that I think that I would tell him that he should go on to LeBron James's podcast or like how he should operate his fashion Parish show like I don't even understand what the meaning behind that is and the idea gets even deeper because they make it they're trying to imply that I'm taking Kanye's money right that he's hired me somehow and it makes me so upset they go on to say sources close to Kanye tell us Candace has been reaching out to people on Kanye's behalf working to set up calls meetings and appearances so basically I'm Kanye's PR agent I have not called a single person on Kanye's behalf I have not set up a single appearance on Kanye's behalf or a meeting on Kanye's behalf unless you're talking about his appearance last night at my documentary Premiere and I set up everybody coming there because I sent invites I sent invites to my friends I sent invites to my family I sent invites to my colleagues and I asked them to attend something that meant something special to me totally normal and yet they're trying to pollute it make it seem like it's weird they're basically trying to make it seem as though Kanye is not Kanye he's just an extension of Candace right now again an insult it goes on to read we're told folks who were close to Kanye and many have distanced themselves after his recent attacks believe he's in a bad space mentally and anyone working to persuade him to do anything other than get help doesn't have his best interests at heart so let me translate that for you Candace Owens needs to just tell Kanye that he's crazy every time they talk say you're crazy you're crazy you're crazy you need to get mental help and you should be nowhere and you should be seen by nobody and no one should be talking to you again with friends like these who needs enemies right they're upset basically they're trying to say we are trying to put pressure on Candace to tell Kanye to listen and to do what Kim wants perhaps write what Kim wants perhaps and in order to do this we're going to talk through the media and we're going to paint Candace like she's some kind of monster who's pulling the strings all untrue even better what's more yay showed up to Candace's film Premiere oh gasp in Nashville Wednesday Ray J was also in attendance a reunion sources told us was coordinated by Candace Owens to spite Kim Kardashian oh there it is Kim poor Kim Kim is a total Victim Because how dare two of her exes be at the same event like and and the idea that why I have been working on this documentary for close to a year I worked on this documentary while I was pregnant I was attacked by the media who were in lockstep lying about the black lives matter narrative who are allowing these protests to burn down our cities I have worked to bring this story to the American people for almost a year but it really all came down to the fact that what I really wanted to do was to make Kim Kardashian angry how how narcissistic and consumed with yourself do you have to be to actually think this is true the truth of how it all ended up is that I had a separate I was building a separate relationship with rage it had nothing to do with yay at all not at all nothing done in spite of Kim when Ray J months ago started saying that the the Kim Kardashian sex tape was all orchestrated by Kim Kardashian like a journalist and like every journalist that reported on the story We reached out to Ray J's Camp oh my God could you imagine actually reaching out to someone's camp and trying to get an answer to a story rather than just running to it I reached out to Ray J's camp and I said I'm very interested in covering this because there are major implications here major implications as in this is a form of prostitution we're talking about a mother we've all been lied to that's the implication here right we've all been lied to and deluded for decades to believe that Kimmy's a victim when in fact what she wanted was to be Fame and she was willing to sell her body to do it that is a compelling story for any journalist especially one who like me reports on culture and reports on politics and believes that culture is interpreting the politics right we now live in a sex sells economy I want to often commentary on that by talking to Ray J asking him to join my show to speak at length about his allegations this is separate from Kanye again took place placed months ago okay so as I've been coordinating and talking to Ray J's team trying to get him to come onto this show I've been open about that fact I established a relationship and I said hey you know why don't we get to know each other you know I'm not trying to harm you I actually learned that he felt hurt by Kanye obviously he was open about that about what happened on the Hulu series and I said this is something that you guys should try to broker some peace between there's no reason to have two black men hating each other it's just I don't like to see black men fighting period you haven't realized my entire commentary on Black America has been the fracturing of relationships the fracturing of familial relationships the inability to resolve conflicts these are things that harm Black America the headline should have read this is amazing they had a entirely peaceful correspondence at the same event nobody gave a comment on the red carpet and said well Kim this blah blah Kim nobody felt that way Kanye was in great spiritual he was smiling Ray J was in great spirits and he was smiling and I felt this is amazing I was able to broke her piece hey what's up Kim why don't you thank me for doing that you harmed a relationship between two people and made them think that there was all this animosity between them and I said you know what there's not everybody come together but no that's not the narrative here the narrative is that my entire documentary was really about harming Kim well okay yeah that's what I want to do it's always wanted to hurt Kim everyone responds to hurt Kim Kardashian she's always the victim she's a victim I'm a victim of the sex tape I'm a victim of the Playboy shoot and now I'm a victim of a black lives matter Premiere event stop yourself sweetheart going on our sources say it's unclear if Candace is getting paid by yay as an advisor you want to know why it's not clear because you didn't ask me you didn't want it to be clear it said you're trying to insert a narrative that I'm potentially taking money from gay I am not I have not taken a single dollar from yay I have to take a single dollar from any of my friends none of them I don't ask to be paid to be friends with people in fact before the parish show no one even knew that Connie and I had a relationship because I don't speak to the Press about these things until the Press attempts to create this nasty narrative One Source says quote anyone taking money from him is taking advantage of him oh okay was that Source Chris or was it Kim just tell us who who called Harvey and said this right I am not taking money from Kanye West I have taken zero dollars from yay West ever ever at all that I take any money from him so this is incredibly insulting and they say as far as Candace's involvement in Kanye's life she's gonna run him into the ground earlier this week Candace leaked an old voicemail from Kim to Ray J in which Kim called Whitney whom Ray J was dating at the time in old hag our Kanye sources say they believe Candace leaked the voicemail to show her allegiance to Kanye especially against Kim was there any confusion whether or not I was friends with Kim and Kanye why would I have to leak a voicemail right to show that I'm friends with Kanye over Kim was was there actually some confusion out there that I needed to actually do this to show my allegiance and let me talk about this is ultra insulting and I shouldn't even speak on this but I'm going to because it matters the truth of the matter is that in covering this yay actually asked me to pull back he said you know she's a mother of my children there was an instance where he said she's the mother of my children when I did that video and I said that she's a prostitute and he said could you please just go a little easy on her right now I said what I said back to him to be completely open is this is what I do for a living journalism is what I do for a living the category the topic today happened to be Kim because what Ray J is saying is compelling but as a friend of his I understand how it is upsetting and I wanted to be more careful in my language going forward because I can see how that could harm her right I could see how that could harm his children rather I don't really care what she did harmed her children okay if raided allegations are true actually what she did has harmed her children and maybe if TMZ wanted to do some journalism they've quite put some pressure on the Kardashian family to respond to the allegations I don't see any cease and desists coming out towards Ray J I don't see anybody say these allegations are false they sound pretty true then because we know you guys have the Press on your side we know you've got tons of money on your side so why aren't you slapping down Ray J's hand I would cover that I would say actually Kim came out and said that Ray J is lying she had nothing to do with the sex tape but she hasn't come out and say that yet so why don't you do your job TMZ and ask her about the allegations and stop making it seem like Kanye is a Monster who does not care about the mother of his children and who does not care about his children themselves he cares about all of those things this is a very very harmful narrative that speaks that adds Credence to the idea that black families cannot come together it's something that I hate I hate seeing families torn apart and I actually hope in the bottom of my heart that Kim and Kanye are are able to resolve their differences I actually hope they get back together I hope they are able to bring their family back together broken families is a Bad Thing ultimately but don't do this it doesn't make it any better don't pretend that because I reported on something that was actually noteworthy that it's somehow Kanye operating me behind the scenes but also me telling Kanye how to operate in front of the scenes that's ridiculous it goes on in finally to say one of the reasons Kanye's former allies believes Candace is in his ear is because until recently he was conciliatory with Kim seemingly agreeing that she would have the kids around 80 of the time and he would have ongoing involvement in their lives that to me sounds like an intentional media plant uh that is leading up to some sort of a custody dispute I have no idea what that's about at all I don't actually it's going to be shocking to you I don't speak ta about Kim because I respect Family Lines I really do and it is not acceptable for any person to be in Kim's ear or to be in yazir saying well here's what you need to do here's what your genie no they need to sit down and they need to be able to resolve these issues as a family I do respect family and me covering a compelling story about the Kardashians was not in any attempt a way to disrupt their family at all it was just a way for me to do what I do on the show every single day report on cultural topics so TMZ you guys are are actual scumbags and I want to say this it's unclear whether or not the Kardashians have you on their payroll and we're reaching out to comment but we haven't heard back yet moving on into realizing the absurdity of media and how all they exist to do is tear people apart the daily wire family is being attempted uh they're attempting to assassinate the daily wire family and tear us apart with this entire yewa story of course people have asked my opinions on Kanye's tweets and I stand by my opinions I do not know what death Con 3 means if you want to know what it means right I do not believe that any person thinks that Defcon 3 means that Con in in if they're being honest they do not believe that Kanye wants all Jews to be killed I don't know what that company means and I said we should ask him ask him what his tweets meant and by golly if the Press was honest they would have reported on the fact that last night yay spoke to reporters about those tweets somebody asked him directly whether or not he was anti-semitic and he answered no and he said that he had been hurt by a lot of people in his life but that's not the headlines today right because he was calm he was Smiley last night and he gave a meaningful response to the ayali's anti-semitic I have said as a friend I'm not going to assess these tweets instead ask him ask him what he meant okay because I'm not buying a narrative and I will not buy a narrative that kante wants all Jews dead I think that's stupid okay but there's been pressure for Ben Shapiro to make me say something right Ben Shapiro come get your girl Candace Owens and he's getting questions on his show I'm getting questions on my show Ben responded on his show and said how he felt about me saying that I do not think that there is any person who is being well-meaning and honest that truly believes that their life is in danger because Kanye West tweeted something that is ultimately incoherent death Con 3 means nothing if you know what death Con 3 means please do send it to me by the way because I'll report on it I will say oh I just got the definition of Defcon 3 and I can confirm that this is what Kanye meant but here is what Ben said in his own words take a listen Addison says what are your thoughts about Kanye West I mean I've made my thoughts about Kanye West pretty clear I mean what he said is anti-Semitic there's no question about it I mean what what he said is pure wrote anti-Semitism whether he is talking about deathcon 3 to Jewish people whether he's talking about blacks are the real Jews I mean this is all anti-Semitism I do not think it is possible to defend that as not anti-Semitism which brings somebody else I see is asking about Candace's defense of Kanye's anti-semitic remarks so let me just say this Candace and I disagree about a wide variety of topics one of the features not the Bugs of daily wire plus is the fact that we openly disagree about all of this stuff I share my opinions about what I think Candace is saying she shares her opinions about what she thinks that I'm saying we battle it out it's one of the things that you get a daily wire plus is the fact that there is a wide variety of listen on a personal level I get Candace defending her friend she's very close with Kanye West I get it I don't think that her defense of Kanye is correct or convincing I I think that the real answer to the Kanye West of it is Kanye is a bipolar human being I mean he's made this very clear I talked about this on the show and bipolar people tend to say extraordinarily bizarre things and ugly things and again that doesn't excuse the bizarreness or the ugliness of the actual remarks which as I will say once again for the 1000th time are in fact anti-Semitic but there's a difference between somebody cohesively saying what Kanye West said and Kanye West saying things in broken grammar in the midst of what appears to be a bizarre period of his life in which he is presenting Adidas Executives with porn in front of their face I'm not going to treat that the same as ilhan Omar saying openly anti-semitic stuff as an elected Congress person in the United States of America so when it comes to Candace I mean look am I still friends with of course I'm friendly with Candace am I friendly with Tucker Carlson and Tucker cut a segment from his interview with Kanye which Connie said a bunch of fantastic stuff listen to my friends with Joe Rogan Joe Rogan head on Roger Waters the other day Roger Waters a ridiculous anti-Semitic jerk I mean like wide varieties of disagreement happen in this space bottom line is when it comes to Kanye's remarks undoubtedly on these medical marks when it comes to Kansas defense of those remarks I think Candace is dead wrong on what she said while respecting her relationship with Kanye she knows Kanye better than I do she doesn't motivate okay whatever all of that I'm sure is true and I will take that for granted what she said about Kanye I radically disagree with I think that she's dead wrong I think that it it is not a a it betrays a lack of understanding about anti-Semitism and and the scope of anti-semitism but we're allowed to have those disagreements that's the way this works totally measured in that response is exactly how I feel and what's interesting to see the reaction to this in this made-up canasones versus Ben Shapiro on yay West is that what people are almost demanding is that daily wire become propagandist they want them to just give a message and for every single person to agree on that message even if it's not how they actually feel they want us to be a bunch of hired actors and actresses which clearly we're not we're not actors and actresses the daily wire exists to give you a variety of opinions Ben has given you his he thinks that yay is bipolar and he does he does not actually think that he wants to harm people but he thinks they comment themselves on their face are anti-semitic I have given you my opinion that something that is incoherent can't be antisemitism you cannot say deathcon 3 which is exactly what I was responding to that tweet in particular and I said it was confusing the Tweet when I saw it I didn't know what Defcon 3 was that is my honest opinion and because I know yay and I know that I met him through his Jewish best friend and I know that I have sat down with him and Jared and I know they are friends and I have been actually the majority of his friends that I have met are Jewish so it's you're just not going to get me to be on this ride or die yay West is an anti-semitic and I'm sorry I don't care the media doesn't get to Pivot and tell me something and say it enough times that I believe it to be true okay I do not believe that as a friend of this person who knows who is it was in his inner circle I will not believe that he wants all Jewish people to be killed and if you don't believe me believe him because as I said he spoke to a reporter last night and that's not going to make the airwaves because now the media is in lockstep trying to create this narrative that all he is is an anti-semite that it wasn't a mistake of any type of this is just what it is he just he wants all Jewish people to be killed it's foolish on its face it's emotional you have a right to demand that people explain themselves and to clarify their points but you do not have a right to just suddenly say that somebody exists forever as an anti-semite and that the only way to show that you like Jewish people in fact they're trying to now say I'm anti-semitic shut up I don't care I do not care that you think that you are going to tell me and try to poison me to believe things about myself that are not true okay just stop it's gone far enough you've made your points you want Kanye gone I get it media but it's not going to happen on my watch he's actually a friend of mine and it is a in the spirit of friendship I wanted to give him the grace to respond by himself again he did that so daily wire it's not higher Candace Owens in case you were wondering to be the black-faced Ben Shapiro they didn't we have a variety of opinions all the time in fact if you remember just a couple of weeks ago we all were disagreeing on the topic of pornography behind the paywall these are the things that you get when you become an all-axis member of a daily wire you can watch these disputes you will see that a lot of the time me and Matt Walsh agree on various topics a lot of the time Jeremy and Ben agree on a lot of topics speaking of which if you want to see how the media lies mediaite which I don't even know really know how to say mediaite.com ran this headlines really incredible I love this headline it says she's wrong in quotation marks daily wire Chief speaks out on Candace Owens defending Kanye's anti-semitic comments so they're just again trying to give this idea that everyone really wires ruffled by this when in fact nobody is nobody is we we are not at all ruffled by this but then when you read the actual quotation of what the daily wire Chief said the daily wire Chief being the CEO the co-ceo Jeremy boring Jeremy said quote I think we've all expressed our disparate views on Kanye's comments pretty thoroughly I don't begrudge Candace her view nor do I be Grudge her defending her friend I suspect she is right that he has no hatred of Jewish people in his heart she would know far better than I I think she's wrong about the anti-Semitism of remarks themselves but I'm not in the business of telling our hosts what to think and say Moors the pity right so uh yeah I agree with that but that of course did not seem clickable and it did not seem like a pile on to Candice Owens they ran with the headline she's wrong two words out of everything that he said which was also completely measured not going to work media so people are considerably outraged and I'm confused about the outrage and I'll tell you why in just a moment but uh supermodel Heidi Klum and her just turned 18 year old daughter Lenny are facing backlash for appearing together in a new lingerie ad the former Victoria's Secret Angel and her model daughter stripped to their skivvies for the Italian intimate wear brand intimasimi a job they hailed as joyful but some called it very disturbing so I'm just going to show you some of these photos and I'll talk through it if you're on the podcast but yeah they're obviously in lingerie just a bra and underwear and they're close to each other their boobs are touching their boobs were on top of one another and it is disturbing the comments on the video I'll read just a few one person wrote I like to think I'm Progressive in these things but mom and daughter in lingerie in the same video shoot is just a bit ick next one says the photo is weird and the caption makes it weirder weirder LOL I wouldn't model sexy lingerie with my mom sexualizing your daughter the moment they turn legal is weird so the reason why I'm a bit confused about the outrage is because I'm assuming that people have become somehow desensitized enough to the Kardashian Empire they don't realize that the entire Empire is being built on incest between sisters so I'm now going to show you some photos from Kylie Cosmetics Kylie Jenner is the youngest uh female in the Kardashian Clan even though her last name's Jenner and every one of her posts with her sisters selling lipstick for every reason is incredibly sexy so you know you're looking at these images here she's almost kissing Kendall in this photo their lips are close to each other there's also some images that I don't want to show because I don't feel comfortable with it but if you you can find them very easily she has her young daughter I don't know how old stormy is two or three years old in between her legs as she poses seductively and they're both in the bathing suit they are in lingerie I don't know why that's necessary to be in lingerie for you to sell lipstick and for you to sell bronzer why do you need to be constantly in lingerie and this one to me is the most disturbing because you have Chloe sitting in between her legs you have Kylie with her legs open and Kylie is touching her sister's butt they're in lingerie she's holding her sister's butt and she's leaning in and Kylie's breasts are on top of uh Chloe and they're just looking seductively what is that you are selling product through incest I'm sorry that's once again Candace calling it as it is I say it's prostitution if you sell your body for money and for fame and I am saying that this is incest and for whatever reason they don't feel that they can sell this product without pretending to create this fantasy in people's head that they have sex with one another we know I don't think they do have sex with one another but I do think that they're they know that this fantasy it's soft it's soft core porn it is soft core pornography meant to make you buy lipstick so that's what I have to say about that moving on to weird celebrity land stuff Vanessa Hudgens uh yeah you might know her from the Disney Channel did you know that she was a witch yeah she is producing an unscripted film entitled dead hot Season of the Witch the project documents hudgin's journey in Salem Massachusetts along with her best friend musician Gigi mcgree as they set out to learn about witchcraft ghost hunting and connecting with the spirit world both Hudgins and mcgree are self-taught students of Witchcraft who have been experimenting and connecting with the spirit worlds for much of their lives after an experience in Northern California somehow they went to ride they realized they needed to seek out proper mentorship mentorship and training that's when best friends set out on a pilgrimage to Salem for a master class in Witchcraft and they brought the cameras along to Chronicle their Journey Hudgens also previously appeared on the Kelly Clarkson show where she admitted that she likes to talk to Demons for fun okay okay Vanessa I guess like I nothing else to do why not talk to some demons for fun it's so dramatic when conservatives say that Hollywood is satanic but for whatever reason they're all ghost hunting and witch-hunting don't forget Demi Lovato started saying that she speaks to ghosts she started saying that she feels that aliens don't like the word alien and she's going on this emotional journey to hunt ghosts and spirits and now you have Vanessa Hudgins who's connecting with the spirit world I'll tell you what this is Hollywood is a culture of atheism right and what these celebrities are actually craving is some spiritualism in their life in the form of God but God forbid but intended that these people actually go to church and actually try to seek what is real in their lives and correct their lives and the paths that they're on so instead they're trying to fill that emotional and spiritual void by going on these Expeditions and becoming witches and starting to hunt for ghosts I always say that I feel tremendously sad when I see these stories because you see that a lot of these people like Vanessa and Demi Lovato were raised up in Hollywood throughout their childhood and they didn't have that structure that they needed from their families to show them what was real faith is real family is real it provides the stability that you need when you make the turn from childhood to adulthood and they don't have that it's lacking substance is what is lacking in their lives and as always we pray that they find it moving on a florida-based plastic surgeon who dubs herself Dr Titus deletus the glib reference to breast removal surgery has been reported to America's consumer watch photographer using her huge Tick Tock following to unfairly and deceptively sway teens into having sex change operations a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission obtained by dailymail.com says that Dr Sid Gallagher who runs Gallagher plastic surgery in Miami talks up the benefits and downplays the risks of sex reassignment surgeries it accuses the doctor of using catchy videos with pop music backing tracks on social media platforms as a marketing gimmick to attract vulnerable and impressionable minors to everything from breast removals to bottom surgery so let's take a listen to these abhorrent videos the most common way we masculine is the Torso is with liposuction and it marries very well with top surgeries so quite a few of her patients will combine it at the same time and so what we're doing is usually we're addressing the kind of love handle Muffin Top fan curve areas right here as you can see in the picture and this is our before and after of course the reason we have those curves is usually because of the pelvis however we can't get rid of any bone but what we can do usually is get rid of the extra padding that is oftentimes in front of that bone and therefore give the patient more straight up and down appearance the really cool thing about this surgery is that once the cells are gone from there the shape will be changed permanently so even if you were to gain weight it would look maybe more a little bit more like a dad but I won't go back to the same curves so typically when we're creating the testicles for Trans Mass masculine bottom surgery we use implants to do it there's two main types available on the market there's a saline implants which I tend not to use because I find patients don't tolerate them as well and then there's These Guys these are squishy silicone implants they feel really natural they're available in different sizes you decide what your dock what the right size is for you and there it is hey Dr Gallagher you are a groomer you're a child groomer and you should be in prison for mutilating children if we lived in a sane world you would be behind bars because you are harming children and you are a predator online who is hoping that children watch your videos and then sign up you're mutilating 400 to 500 of them per a year and it is absolutely despicable it is unbelievable what Tick Tock allows actually it is believable because I've been telling you all that if there's one social media app that you need to delete from your children's lives it is Tick Tock it is very obvious that the Chinese are weighing heavily on the trans agenda because if you want two weakened men and women and families what better way than to mutilate children they will never ever ever grow up to have productive families you're not going to have strong men when all of them have breast implants right and are taking pills to make themselves more effeminate men are a threat because they are the preservers of our society it is the men that we send to war there will be none left if we allow this dangerous narrative to persist and truly that's all I have to say about that all right guys I want to take a second

what is your Strange Addiction I've recognized mine and I'm going to tell you why I'm even asking the question recently I would say over the last three years I've been realizing that a lot of people sort of have this disorder I almost wish refer to it as refer to it as a financial disorder you may recognize it as well you may be seeing it specifically in younger individuals I'll give you a brief story a few years ago I had to fire an assistant she was young 23 years old and the back story was quite interesting we started recognizing we knew she had shared with us that she had credit card debt and so she was happy to have the job and work down her credit card debt but despite having this debt whenever we would travel or go anywhere she sort of had this impulsive spending habit you know what I mean like you'd walk into a random store maybe a gift shop somewhere and she'd just grab things that she obviously didn't need and she'd just say and I'm not kidding when I'd say don't buy that you know you you always say you have credit card debt you don't need that she'd say yeah but I just know that one day I'm going to be rich I've just always known in my soul that one day I'm going to be rich right so it doesn't matter if I'm spending this today because someday tomorrow somewhere in the future I expect to have a lot of money it makes entirely no sense but you know 23 years old uh you're not usually the most financially responsible person I certainly wasn't I was in debt I had student loan debt so I just sort of would observe this we moved her to Washington DC to live with us to live in the same city with us rather and I remember that as she was searching for apartments I helped her I said okay let me try to help you find a place since you're making this big move for us and we went to go see a bunch of apartments that were nice they were spacious perfect for a 23 year old single individual and she'd just say um this apartment is just too old and she decided instead to move herself into the same building that my husband and I were living and my husband so we obviously were in a much better financial situation than her the building was way too expensive for a 23 year old that was in debt but for her it was better to spend every dollar that she had on rent that she could sort of keep up with appearances if you will think about that people are doing this people that could be saving that could be working down their debts they're instead saying I just want to keep up with appearances but whose appearance is right she's not feeling pressure from me everybody knows my background everybody knows that I don't come from any money everybody knows that I had to work myself out of almost 100 000 in student loan debt and I didn't do that I didn't accomplish that until I was around 27 or 28 years old so it was really bizarre to observe her acting in this way and then there's uh one story which I will never forget we had to go to London for work I was on a tour at the time on college campuses overseas and the company that we were working for paid for hotels at the Marriott it's a Marriott hotel somewhere in London and I didn't stay there because obviously my husband at the time lived there and he had his bachelor pad still in London but she was staying there and she sent us a message saying that she was going to move her hotel and stay somewhere else because the hotel wasn't that nice I remember looking at my husband and saying what a weird thing for a 23 year old what do you mean the hotel wasn't that nice I mean I don't think it's exactly the Ritz but it's a Marriott you're in London what a wonderful opportunity why are you going to move yourself into a more expensive hotel somewhere in what you deem to be a nicer neighborhood in London that doesn't make any sense you're 23. you know I would have slept anywhere when I was 23 if I had the opportunity to go to London I specifically said to her at the time I said that is not smart stay in the hotel it's free a company is paying for it don't waste your money to stay somewhere else and she replied and she said it's totally fine because my parents are going to foot the bill on this my parents are going to pay for this still made no sense to me if your parents are going to pay for a hotel on Monday why don't they help you pay down your credit card debt but you know not my finances not my problem whatever well fast forward about uh seven months later and my husband and I found out that she was stealing from us that this person this individual was stealing from us and we were shocked but then also in the retrospect not that surprised because clearly she was in a state of desperation and one of the knights in one of the manners that she stole from us was in London we paid for that hotel upgrade she used my personal finances and she paid to put herself into a nicer hotel which she later posted by the way on Instagram the night that she stayed in that hotel because I guess it was just a glamorous shot and what's interesting obviously we had to to fire her but what's interesting in the retrospect is that this is sort of the disorder that seems to be happening all across America it's almost an Instagram disorder right you're looking at people and they're living this indulgent Lifestyle on Instagram and you're just thinking to yourself I need to keep up with appearances I know maybe this is Kardashian culture right I just want people to think that I'm living a luxurious life right so the bathroom in the hotel room at a Marriott is not going to fulfill that narrative so I instead need to upgrade just so I can get this picture that I can post on Instagram people can go oh wow what an amazing life you have that is just so wonderful wow I can't believe you're in London it's so it's So Glamorous that you're in London basically people are developing Financial disorders for likes and you'd like to think that this is just something that is happening amongst younger people but I also had another recent scenario with somebody who I guess was exhibiting symptoms of the exact same Financial disorder this time someone who's 37 years old you would think by 37 you had figured it out right you cannot be spending your last dollar on rents you cannot live that way you would hope that you would pay down your debts that you would be responsibly saving but it doesn't doesn't just stop because you're older it's not like your brain becomes more developed and you become more serious because as I said online culture is killing people it's killing their lives it's killing their motives and it's not making them reason it's not leading to more reasonable decision making and so this older individual 37 years old with a child was living the exact same way this individual was in the middle of moving and I was helping her move and I was sending her links to a bunch of what I deemed to be really nice apartments for her and her 10 year old child and she was writing back being like I would never live there I would never ever ever lay my head there I just need to feel comfortable and the best way that I can feel comfortable if I lay my head in a place that's brand new it just has to be brand new so I'm thinking okay well that's how you need to live your life that's totally fine if I I guess the places I'm sending you are not nice enough well it would turn out fast forward uh that this person was down to their last ten thousand dollars in their bank account but still they wanted to move into a place that was being just being built and spend thirty five hundred dollars a month on rent to keep up with appearances again why is this happening well we know this is happening because people are spending their Time online and looking at people who are a lot more wealthy than them and sometimes people that are not more wealthy than them but are at least playing a part that they are that they've got all of this money and all this resources and so I started having this discussion with my husband and thinking wow it's scary to me scary to me to to think that there are so many people that are living so on edge and I started examining this and started reading these research papers on this new psychological disorder that I've been identifying and what I actually found out about this um is that for men they tend to gamble with their finances right so for men they gamble you think about men that play poker men that that bet on sports games well for women that exact same quality is shown through shopping disorders through buying disorders it's a form of gambling right you're just kind of playing with your finances you don't really have the money but oh well you're going to wait until the check comes in for next month and then maybe okay you're going to be able to afford it just kind of skating on thin ice at all times and I thought that is really really interesting and I said to my husband okay just because we have more resources doesn't mean that we're not also being indulgent which brings me back to that question what are you a slave to how are you indulging how can you become a better person to make sure that you're not living in that same capacity because just because you have more money and you maybe have a little cushions in a savings account doesn't mean that you should be an idiot doesn't mean that you should be wasteful and so I started being more conscious of myself and I realized My Strange Addiction ready guys My Strange Addiction paper towels it was it's just something that my husband would say wow you used a lot of paper towels and I started being more conscious of this and I realized that I would cook dinner then if you looked into the trash I maybe used like an entire roll it was psychotic I don't I don't understand I'm just wiping and using paper towels like a psychopath all throughout um all throughout cooking all throughout cleaning I was thinking in my head how much money is this costing me this little habit that I go oh well it's fine I can afford paper towels it's not a big deal who cares we can afford paper towels but no then I started to care about this and I thought to myself this is extremely indulgent it's completely psychotic why am I using this many paper towels so I actually asked my producers to look into this paper towel phenomenon it seems like a weird strange addiction but it's I do it without really being aware all right here are some interesting facts about paper towels ready according to data from euromonitor International Global spending on paper towels for use at home but not in office or public bathrooms just at home ready add it up to about 12 billion dollars in 2017. and Americans accounted for about 5.7 billion dollars of that total listen if America is 5.7 billion dollars of that total let me tell you I think I'm 3.7 billion I just it's me I am a problem okay so the U.S spends nearly as much on paper towels as every other country in the world combined what it's completely crazy we have this weird paper towel fetish the next stat over 13 billion pounds of paper towels are used per year in America alone so it might seem silly but I decided to stop contributing to that and I did something I mean I've been using paper towels for as long as I can remember I just purchased some rags I told everybody in my household to please stop using paper towels and just start using Rags that we could then clean and we could put into the wash after because it just makes more sense again it's a small indulgent Behavior but I just wanted to correct it because having more doesn't mean that you should be acting you know stupid in any capacity so I wanted to really think about what it meant that America you know we really are just considered an indulgent culture we just more more excess excess excess we like wealth we like money and maybe that is the result of living in a free market capitalist society and definitely as a result of being a society that glorifies Hollywood so much right this is like this is the result of all of those things but I want to look around and sort of examine where we are seeing this and it brings me to the cultural topic of the day which is lizzo right lizzo to me is so emblematic of this more more and more society that we live in in fact she might be the first artist to say I am unbelievably fat and being fat is delicious you should all want to be like me and be more fat it's amazing look at my lifestyle I'm half naked standing in front of a private plane there are photos of her act actually doing that I'm half naked on the sidelines at basketball games but I'm look I'm in the front row this is I'm wealthy I'm fabulous and I'm fat and I'm happy and you should aspire to this too and people applaud her all the time they yes they love it I don't know people want more of this lack of substance is what it really is but give me give us more lizzo give us more fat and the company instacart has decided to make her the face ready here is a recent commercial that they came out featuring lizzo hmm what am I gonna get oh cherries oh okay how about Cherry ice cream with sprinkles and maybe shut up like that and a French boy you know what I need bath bombs away Gotta Have Takis oh I need balls okay I'm gonna need some glue oh and a new charger I can never find those things and I gotta get flowers for mommy and a little something for me you're not gonna roll [Music] so there it is lizzo sitting in a bathtub uh ordering everything that her heart could possibly desire putting Takis in her instacart surrounded by food and fairies and just luxury because why not right why don't we want lizzo in a bathtub ordering a bunch of stuff this is America more more more excess excess excess and of course nobody wants to tell you the truth here's the truth uh there's you cannot let somebody lead you to believe that lizzo is a happy individual right she is clinically obese do you know how exhausting it must be to carry around that weight all day I mean I think about when I indulge as I did when I was in Los Angeles this week and I had two In and Out Burgers I'm like I never get in and out so I had two single In and Out Burgers and it was so good going down that instant high that you get from bad food and then afterwards as I had to sit on a flight for four hours I just was like I feel disgusting oh I just want to go for a run I want to get rid of this right that temporary high followed by this long period of just downness being like Oh I just need to move my body sitting stationary on a plane after eating two burgers not a good feeling at all right it's not a form of punishment but I just felt when I got home the next day I wanted to just kind of you know go for a run move my body and that was actually real happiness right so what she's selling to you lizelle and what instacart is selling to you is a lie these Indulgence don't make us more happy you might get some temporary uh kick a little rush of Serotonin when you first put all of this gross food into your mouth or you might get a temporary high when you first purchase that thing that you don't really have money for but I'm just gonna buy this Louis Vuitton bag I'm just gonna buy these earrings I'm just gonna buy this stuff because I keep seeing the ads appear on Facebook there's a temporary high and maybe even when you're opening the package right you get home oh my god there it is my package from revolve oh my gosh this cute outfit I saw right nice little temporary high and then you go to your bank account and you're like I'm skating again I'm just barely getting by I have this angst and I have this anxiety because I'm not I'm not comfortable I'm not financially comfortable you that angst net anxiety is something that lizzo experiences every day there's no doubt in my mind that lizzo has to be suffering from different forms of some form of a depression because that's what happens when you're carrying around that much weight all the time your body does not signal to your body that you are happy to lie this commercial is a lie lizzo is a lie and what do these lies lead to what what does it naturally yield when we are consistently telling people that more more and more and more and more we're running them happier well I think actually it leads to a society that is primed for socialism why do you think it people respond so well when you say this should be free and this should be free and this should be free well because the majority of these people can never have enough right more and more and more and more and more but I can't really afford it so when someone gets on a platform and they say well we're going to make this free right this should be someone else's responsibility it's the it's the upper one percent that are the problem people go oh yeah that's it I'm not the problem I'm not it's because they have too much not that I'm a responsible but they have too much tax them more give us more free stuff that my friends is a state of American politics today we're about to get into some crazy news stories but first it's

guys now let's get into some topics [Music] so first we have this headline and you are just wow wait until you hear and see this video so an LA school district is slammed for posting a woke video that says calling junk food bad is wrong and promotes new concepts of food neutrality that claims diet culture is based on oppression take a listen I got us Donuts those are so bad for you oh no are they moldy I mean are they poisoned are you allergic no I'm just saying you're judging my food choices based on a false standard of Health again aren't you guilty bad culture fat phobia and systems of Oppression have created false hierarchies of food and it shows up everywhere for instance harmful thought patterns like earning food through exercising or that dessert is the reward for the punishment of eating vegetables remember that you do not need to earn food we are all incorrectly taught from a young age that our size and therefore the foods that we eat are markers of our self-worth moralizing food can lead to harmful relationships of food and assorted eating instead of focusing on good and bad choices try to approach food with neutrality in mind the only foods that are bad for you are foods that contain allergens poisons and contaminants or food that is spoiled or is otherwise inedible eat without guilt regard less of what society says the fact that that video is called smarter in seconds when of course it is just making people dumb the idea that we don't have a food hierarchy in terms of health like like there there it really is the same if you want to wake up every morning and consume 12 donuts or if you wake up in the morning and you consume kale that's what they're basically saying they're saying it doesn't matter what you eat as long as it's not poisonous to you you're good this is such a tremendous lie and what really bothers me about this video is that everyone speaking is black every single person in this video is black because you know what it is if there is a stupid idea that they wish to perpetuate they always use black individuals as a spokesperson because my opinion which is never going to edit is that the government believes that black Americans represent the dumbest race in America right so they go and they find some overweight black people and they say oh you know it's totally fine if you're a hundred pounds overweight you feel good right you're like lizzo look at lizzo she's got a private plane it's it's great it's okay to be fat what's actually wrong is not the fact but obesity is the number one killer in America which it is obesity which leads to heart disease is the number one killer in America which it is but don't worry about that don't let that fact get in the way of how good you feel when you eat those donuts instead we need to change the system make it go upside down we need to make people realize that these are harmful ideas to tell people to be healthy and to not carry extra weight and to not suffer from depression that comes and is associated with being overweight don't worry about the heart disease don't worry about dying young indulge indulge yourself in candy and donuts and fruit as long as it's not poisonous as long as it's not laced with arsenic you are doing the right thing and so now we are going to make you smarter by sharing these videos and telling you that it's okay to die this is what happens when you are a part of a society that is toxic and you are being led by people that hate you and want you to die that's that's what that headline and what that video means but if you think that was bad hang on hang on because there's another headline ready you're not going to believe this one a Texas teacher was fired after telling students that they shouldn't judge people that want to have sex with a five-year-old yep you heard me correctly take a listen we're not going to call them that we're going to call them Max no matter of attracted persons no don't judge people just because they won't have sex with a five-year-old I can't even believe what I'm hearing she is stopping a student who likely said he's a pedophile and said no no no no no no Diego no no we're not going to call them that we're going to call them Maps minor attracted persons another thing that they just came up with to justify pedophilia right remember when they said it was Radical I've been saying this for years what was going to follow the trans agenda right telling children that they have sexual autonomy that they can pick their gender you know it's just their choice and their opinion about what they are of course the next thing is going to be lightening pedophilia right well this is an individual who can decide whether or not they want to be a male or whether or not they want to be a female this child can make this decision so what would be the next logical step saying oh well they can make decisions these are just sexual preferences we should be treating these people with a certain respect that allows them to decide what they want to do in their life they're not children these adults are just minor attracted people yeah I'm happy this teacher was fired but it's not enough this teacher should be in prison Diego in class you are a hero for telling her she's out of her mind whoever recorded this video you are also a hero for getting rid of this sick minded individual I mean do not pass go straight to jail this is what's happening by the way this is Texas this is a conservative State this is a Republican state could you imagine what's happening inside the classrooms in Los Angeles and in New York if this is what's happening in Texas yeah very scary parents time to pay attention to what is going on in these classrooms because it's no good I will not send my child to school into public school under these conditions and neither should you we're talking about indulgences and that is what that teacher is doing it we're indulging in every weird fetish and perverse idea that we have we're indulging in food we're indulging when we go and we swipe our credit cards for things that we absolutely we can not afford and all of it is leading to a state of people that are not happy and by no means are they being rendered Freer all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to expand on the question of the day the topic of the day if you will regarding indulgences by telling you more stories of former assistance I know it makes me sound bad how many assistants have you had Candice but I promise you there is a new breed of individual coming up these 22 23 year olds they're built differently and not in a good way they're all a little indulgent so I had the year of the assistant where I went through three before we landed upon Savannah who you guys know and I'm going to tell you those stories of why those other two got fired remember the first one was fired because she stole from me and then two came after very quickly and then we're gone we're gonna talk about that so if you are not a member go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe subscribe right now [Music]", "6Xmn66RZWPk": "moving on to the state of college campuses which is deteriorating not just the United States but also abroad Oxford University yes very highbrow it's Oxford of course of course this is the kind of school you want to get into my husband graduated from Oxford University what a smart chap he is well they have something known as the Oxford Union where they have political thinkers come and they debate issues that are relevant I know this because I was very honored to have received an invite from the Oxford Union and I participated in one of these debates two years ago about whether or not Trump should be president and it was great it really is a wonderful tradition that they have and now it's time to ask questions about the trajectory of that tradition the trajectory of the Oxford Union because they have now invited bad baby in case you don't remember who bad baby is she found her Fame on Dr Phil when she told him to cash me outside how about that just honestly just just take a listen in all these hoes laughing like so funny she's talking about the audience that they're laughing at her did did you say that the the hoes are laughing yep so the audience are a bunch of hoes yeah [Applause] okay catch me outside how about that yeah that doesn't really sound like English definitely not the kind of English that should land you speaking in front of the Oxford Union cash me outside how about that but that is exactly where you could cash her today she was invited to speak at the union regarding her success now by the way do not fault this girl at all I am a free market capitalist and right now there is a market for stupid and she has made 50 million dollars in one year okay so she should be laughing at me right because this girl is wealthy and she is Rich because she started in only fans account and since we live in a pornographic nation which people were excited and sitting at the end of their seats to watch that young girl once on Dr Phil turn 18 she made an incredible amount of money because she was willing to take her clothes off so again joke's on me maybe she should be speaking to the Oxford Union and explaining to people how yeah it is possible to make money without having a single Monica Club intelligence you just have to understand that in today's market sex cells in Western culture sex cells we are in indecent culture and we are a corroding culture and there are a lot of people who if they understood that could have a lot more money than they have today they could definitely afford money at the grocery store they wouldn't even be concerned about inflation bad baby she's not concerned about inflation right she's concerned about whether she wants to fly business or first class to England so that she can speak in front of the Oxford Union again sad State and commentary on the state of things today moving on guys we definitely need to jump into this story uh because it's important it's important because if you don't know Dwyane Wade speaking of the NBA and things that NBA players condone that don't seem to impact their reputation Dwyane Wade is a basketball player he is married to the actress Gabrielle Union Dwayne Wade has a son a son who thinks that he is a girl and Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union believe that it is a form of acceptance to encourage these thoughts that their young son is having so notoriously when he the son's name used to be Zion notoriously when Zion was 12 years old he basically came out and said actually no I'm a woman and Gabrielle Union took him to a pride parade and they're like yes we're just going to support this now Zaya now known as Zia he actually changed his name to Zaya legally is getting all of these contracts for modeling is walking Runway shows because we live in this perverse society that is actually celebrating what is really a mental disorder right General dysphoria is a mental disorder and if you had parents that loved you and cared about you they would want to get you help I always correlate the transgender discussion to anorexia right I used to have anorexia you can find the information pertaining that in my book I've talked about it openly and I am just so grateful that as a society we recognize that anorexia is in fact a mental disorder right if you are thin and you think that you are fat you have a mental disorder if you are thin as I was it was very very thin and that you think that you need to control aspects of your life by not eating as I did then you have something that is a mental disorder right you're trying to relieve stress in all of the wrong ways fortunately when I was young we just said you got to fix that it's a problem and it's wrong now you have kids that have mental disorders and you would have adults that would say um you know what you shouldn't eat today if you're anorexic you shouldn't eat for the next three weeks let's see how long you can go without eating because I want to affirm what you believe that you are and if you believe that you're fat and you don't want to eat for three weeks I'm a loving parent and I'm going to let you do that yeah it's pretty crazy to even consider that plausibility but that is what is happening and it is even more extreme because we are affirming individuals like Zaya right who are eventually going to want to not just say I don't want to take any hormones or I want to skip puberty but they're eventually going to mutilate their bodies well Gabrielle Union is not actually Zaya's mother stepmother yes but not her actual mother and her biological mother is now standing up her name is Siobhan Wade and she is accusing Dwyane Wade of exploiting their 15 year old transgender daughter for financial gain and she's begging a court to intervene to stop her referring to ziya from changing her name and gender on her birth certificate she wants to end this right that is a strong mother standing up and saying this has gone far enough I do not care that she is receiving all of these cash and all this offers because we have a culturally sick Society I am the mother I want to protect my child and Dwayne Wade essentially is saying I'm not taking any advantage uh we are me and Gabrielle Union are just supporting ziya on his journey and that is totally fine and it's not totally fine there's an element of this that makes me believe that Dwyane Wade is sick there is something wrong here he's living out something through his child right I can't believe that any adult that is not themselves have did themselves have a mental disorder or themselves are just looking for attention online and likes because it's trending to say I support the lgbtqrs society right I cannot believe that any well-meaning adult would allow their child to go down this path but allow their child to accept money for harming themselves right we know where this is going to end we know where it's going to end when you wake up one day and you realize it actually no you cannot have a productive family you cannot have a productive lifestyle if you are making a decision to mutilate your body right you're going to become a candidate for big Pharma drugs and pharmaceuticals for the rest of your life we know all of these things and yet people are too scared to say it because they don't want to be called a transpho well guess what I'm happy to be called a transphobe when it comes to standing up for children alright guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Aaron Carter's death so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "htnHiiOFIQ8": "and talking about psychological immune system you of course have to take a look at the complete and utter corrosion of our culture I often talk about cardi B the reason for that is because she is emblematic of exactly that and I think about Black Culture in particular but it's everywhere right but Black Culture they seem to always want to emphasize right as soon as there was an artist that comes up in Black America they basically encourage that artist to lean into bad stereotypes right to lean into things that are harmful so if you're a rapper they want you to lean in to uh ghetto culture right they want you to be talking about gangs if you're a singer which we're going to get to a little bit later lizzo they want you to lean into being fat all of these things that obviously it's just digital toxins for Black America right what you put in on your ears what you're listening to these are all digital toxins they're making you think that you should Aspire toward this lifestyle because because they will reward you no the majority of you if you lived like this you'll probably end up in either prison dead if we're talking about being clinically obese but no it's okay they're going to award a couple of people if we're living like this and encourage a bunch of other people to ruin their lives by aspiring to this so cardi B released a song recently with the artist glorilla I believe that actually it's glorilla song in which cardi is featured on which is called tomorrow too and I'm just going to read you some of these lyrics because I think digital toxins should be spoken about just one portion I don't speak dog hoe wolf I don't care what no say no I stay on her mind I got condos in that  head ah she say she don't f with me who who said you can ho never that n-word a Munch and he gonna eat me like a mango long ass weave it'd be tickling my ass crack okay okay followed by wonder what I'll do tomorrow that these hoes will be mad at oh Pick Me cardi I can tell you what um I will be mad at and it's the fact that despite the the fact that you made it out which is commendable that is a good thing that you started from a position where you had virtually nothing you got an opportunity on loving hip-hop and now you are in a place where you have some status despite all of those things rather than saying I'm going to use my position for good and I'm going to encourage people to do good you think that you can only stay authentic to yourself by preaching poison you know this is poison you know that the majority of the girls that are listening to this are not ever going to make it out of the hood you know that the majority of the young boys and the young girls that are listening to this are going to think that it's cool to have this sort of drama in their life and they're going to think it's cool to turn to the streets and they may be harmed but you don't care about that because you I guess think that this is all you can be it's not true you can be more you could definitely be more I don't mind where you started what I mind is that you are intentionally denying growth and you think that that keeps you real it doesn't it keeps you it keeps you really stupid and it keeps people that are much smarter than you continually using you like a puppet to further poison the youth in that same vein we should discuss lizzo who had an opportunity I I don't know why they gave her this opportunity but they gave her the opportunity to play a 200 year old glass flute that was given to James Madison so that is a historical Relic obviously they're giving her something that means a lot the way in the manner in which they gave it to her in the way in the manner in which she used it offends me I'm not going to lie here is a video of her playing that flute take a listen Phoenix [Applause] towards [Applause] we just made history tonight so I twerked and played James Madison's flu and I made history tonight um okay we'll just so you know a little bit about that flute the antique crystal flute belonged to President James Madison was likely rescued by Dolly Madison when British soldiers set the White House on fire during the war of 1812. so no she's not making history here she's defiling history it's like spraying graffiti on a historical building and going oh it's art no it's not art we're not going to call it art we're not going to call it making history but she doesn't see that right she thinks that when these companies reached out to her these organizations reach out to these opportunities it's because they love her and in reality the reason it's because they hate and want to corrupt the people that follow her right they don't want more people to make it out like lizzo did again I've said this on previous episodes I'm going to say it again I like lizzo's music I think she's talented I think she's tremendously talented I like that she can play the flute I like that she plays other instruments and I love that she can contributes to music I just wish that she would contribute positively I wish that she would understand that there are people with more nefarious goals that recognize her as a talented individual and they are using her to sell bad ideas to the rest of society because what they're actually after is to enslave the rest of you right they do not want everybody to be productive they do not want everybody to wake up every day and go to work and to make a lot of money because that is not how it works right the haves want to ensure there is a constant pool of have-nots that's not a conspiracy that's a fact right it is not a conspiracy conspiracy to think that there are people that want you to consume garbage it's not a conspiracy to think that there are people that want to impact your psychological immune system negatively that wants you to constantly live in a state of fear that wants you to constantly live with your hand out in the way that they get you to become that sort of an individual that sort of an individual that will need handouts the sort of individual that will rely on government to give you solutions for the rest of your life is through Artistry it is through Hollywood it is through people like cardi B and lizzo who don't understand that they are Pawns in the game of chess they don't even know that they're playing alright guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus

Vaseline on his new tattoo so the nurse sees this tattoo and she calls the police and it turns out the boy had gotten tattooed with his mother's permission from a neighbor according to local authorities now some states have no minimum age for receiving a tattoo if a parent allows it but in New York which is where this took place you have to be 18 or older so both the tattoo artist who was a guy named Austin Smith who was 20 years old and was not licensed and the boy's mother were arrested my boy's mother's 33 years old the pictures of the boy's arm stirred outrage all across new sites and social media and Dr Cora Bruner who is a pediatrician and a professor at the University of Washington Medical Center's Seattle Children's Hospital she has come out and she has said a tattoo is a permanent Mark or symbol that you are putting on your body and I don't think that kids under 18 have that kind of agency to make a decision we need to look at these laws again now let me say that on its face I am totally fine with people being outraged that 10 year old got a tattoo I actually totally agree that 10 year old does not possess within them the ability to quite understand this is a permanent Mark they're going to have forever and the the fact that his mother allowed him to do this calls into question her sanity what I like to point to those is the tremendous hypocrisy here that you now have a pediatrician and you have psychologists and professors coming out and saying this is really wrong kids don't have the ability to make this decision but I bet if you follow their train of thought and you started talking about the transgendered agenda hmm these same professors and doctors would say of course a child understands that they want to chop their penis off of course a child who understands that they want to take medicine to block their puberty which of course has very severe educations for the rest of their life these exact same individuals who are saying that this tattoo is so wrong are fully on board with what is happening in the classroom if you want me to be if I had to pick both of these things are bad if I depict between giving my 10 year old a tattoo make nutrition for him or allowing my children to take puberty blockers I would take door a every single time so again I find the story to be hypocritical and I would have no doubt that these same School nurses were talking about New York who are being told not to inform the parent if their child has concerns about their gender the stuff that they're actually brainwashing them within classroom right those that same nurse would not have called the cops had that child had been administered puberty blockers which is what they're trying to get past these are the state laws that everyone's trying to get passed to pretend that children are somehow I don't know have the autonomy the bodily autonomy to be able to decide whether or not they want to get these procedures and surgeries and to take these pills project Meritage you guys know them they are our friends love James O'Keefe had him on this program many times they released a new video today exposing an educator that worked at a worked past tense because of the Scandal worked at a prestigious Connecticut private school you guys know that I am from Connecticut so this story hit me differently it just makes me so terrified my sister still lived there so there is a an educator named Iman rosti who made sexually explicit statements about his current high school students now he oversees green Farms Academy's Writing Center and he also teaches Middle School English and is the seventh grade Dean so this is not some new guy just got here he was recorded fantasizing about his young female pupils I'd like to apologize in advance but take a listen to what he said in his own words is positioned in a way that I actually see the thing not even tempted yes I mean literally not with my K-12 but College thanks [Music] many many many many of my students so he's being turned on by underwear that his peoples are wearing and he also goes as far as to say that he's also had sex with some of the college students that he sees and all this has been caught on camera and uh of course it has been received the right way people are understandably outraged and this person as an update has been removed but it's ridiculous to me that it takes a project Veritas reporter to be able to go undercover and we bring these stories to the Forefront because it is very obvious that they are trying to destroy relationships that children have with their parents because they are looking to create relationships to have those relationships mimicked inside the classroom and it's why I'm constantly talking about all these various agendas and when they're saying don't tell your mom this or don't tell your dad that and then you have a bunch of people that are working that are talking to your children about sex wildly inappropriate used to not take place in America before the 1970s right sex education was something that was thought up by ideologues Planned Parenthood got involved trying a teacher children about everybody's just having sex so we should learn about it in school actually everybody was not having sex the majority of the student population was graduating with their virginity intact outside of high school and now it's the exact reverse because they're teaching sex in the classroom they are intentionally sexualizing children and at the same time somehow sexualizing the adults in the classroom again I am speaking generally I'm not of course talking that I'm not of course suggesting that every teacher is horrific and every teacher has sexual fantasies about your children but I am saying that what will come down the pipeline right if we don't stand up to these more nefarious agendas like kids being told as young as kindergarten that they can pick their genders and that their genitals don't mean anything what do you think is going to the natural product of this and when you see these teachers that are fighting for the right to talk to your kids about sex yeah you're looking at somebody who is a predator somebody whose mind is not right and should not be in the classroom and that's all I'm going to say on that topic alright guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on

favorite euphemism for uh I don't know a prostitute an Instagram model who claims she had a year-long affair with married Maroon 5 front man Adam Levine he's 43 and he asked her if he could name his unborn third child with supermodel bahati Prinsloo that's his wife after her okay so let's just watch the video that she posted to tick tock um to talk about the affair that she had I'm just gonna rip the band it off because I've retaken this like 10 times now essentially I was having an affair with a man who's married to a Victoria's Secret model at the time you know I was young I was naive and I mean quite frankly I feel exploited I wasn't in the scene like I am now um so I was definitely very easily manipulated Maroon 5 is practically elevator music at this point so I'm sure you know who Adam Levine is um but Adam and I were seeing each other for about a year after I stopped talking to him over you know a period of months this is uh how he came back into my life he said okay serious question I'm having another baby and if it's a boy I really uh want to name it Sumner you okay with that dead serious um I was like I'm in hell like I have to be in hell at this point I mean my morals were unknowingly compromised I was completely manipulated and healed this privately I never wanted to come forward because obviously I know the implications that come with doing what I do making money the way I do and being an Instagram model um so being tied to a story like this it's like I know the stereotypes I had sent um I'd send some screenshots recklessly to a few friends I thought I trusted and one of them had attempted to sell to a tabloid um so here I am she's an Instagram model guys quite frankly she feels exploited quite frankly she feels like like manipulated like I her morals were like unknowingly compromised she was object though Sumner's a victim like she didn't know like she's just like a girl like how was she supposed to know she's on the internet and she like I mean it's like elevator music Maroon 5 music and everybody clearly knows who Adam Levine is but she is the victim of the story don't you feel sad for her she had to go on Tick Tock and talk about how she wrecked a marriage and by the way I am not excusing Adam Levine from this I am just so fascinated by how degenerate your mind has to be in order for you to realistically obviously respond to the fact that somebody is Rich and Famous go for it because you're an Instagram model right hope that you're going to establish wish with him do this for an entire year and then publicly come out with this story not like you did the moral thing to do which would be if you really thought in reflection that you were doing something that was wrong you would reach out to his wife we would reach out to Behati Prinsloo who doesn't deserve this she's currently pregnant she has no idea clearly about this affair and she finds out on Tick Tock right if you are a moral individual to reached out to her and you said hey you know I am sorry for what I did I am sorry how what I have done and what I have contributed to hurt you yes I knew what I was doing clearly everybody knows who Adam Levine is everybody knows Maroon 5 is if she was a moral person that's what she would have done nope she went on like Tech talk because like Tech talk I don't know I feel morally because I feel exploited I'm the victim because I was young yeah you were desperate to establish a relationship with a famous rich man right prostitution is the oldest trade in the book and you did all of this knit you want us to feel bad for you Amber Heard because we're all so stupid that we're supposed to think oh Adam Levine just took advantage of you you didn't know what was going on of course you knew exactly what was going on this was supposed to be a trade right you were going to trade sex for a little bit of status it happens over and over and over again but I guess in the era of me too we're not allowed to say that too bad I just said that by the way Adam Levine really sucks that you would do this to somebody really sucks that you would do this to somebody who was pregnant and I can't even begin to unpack what kind of a psychosis you must be in to then say you want to name the child after someone that you are allegedly having an affair with but he did release this statement so I want to add it he said a lot is being said about me right now and I want to clear the air I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in any kind of flirtatious manner did not have an affair nevertheless I crossed the line during a regrettable period in my life in certain instances it became an appropriate appropriate I have addressed that and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family my wife and my family is all I care about in this world to be this naive and stupid enough to risk the only thing that truly matters to me was the greatest mistake I could ever make I will never make it again I take full responsibility we will get through it and we will get through it together okay um sure I'm glad that you're offering a public apology but it kind of feels a bit moot you know as I said bahati Prinsloo is pregnant this is a terrible terrible thing for any woman to have the supper while she's pregnant and yeah you had terrible judgment whether you had an affair or not goes back to what we said earlier right if you are engaging in online behavior that you would not engage in in real life you are guilty right it is not just an active infidelity when it happens in the real world virtual oh online I'm flirting with this Instagram model and she's obviously a disgusting human being but it shouldn't matter it does matter be better stop separating yourself from your behavior online that's all I have to say about that another story which I have very little to say about because it speaks for itself and it just it breaks my heart in a way that black culture has come to this in fact one of my favorite things and my favorite things I mean least favorite things that people say to me is you know because you don't represent Black Culture this is what they say you don't understand Black Culture you don't know Black Culture when we see these images of girls twerking on the screen constantly wearing thongs when we see people like cardi B performing and being I mean just completely debasing what it means to be a black woman right when we see this and say Candace you don't know you don't understand Black Culture nope um I don't know why you think this is Black Culture I don't um I don't know who led you to believe that this is all black culture how to represent I don't know why you don't understand how degenerative black culture has become because when I was growing up I was growing up with the Temptations I was watching things like Family Matters this is not what Black Culture from was when I was growing up this wasn't the 80s and the 90s our families were together we had values we had faith we believed in God we believed in our families today none of those things right we're just celebrating promiscuity we're celebrating unity and somebody along the lines convinced us that it's ours that celebrating rap culture which promotes gun violence and gangs and death and murder is ours it's not ours I refuse to accept it so when you tell me I don't know it's good I don't want to know it I want nothing to do with that I want to be part of the regenerative culture I want to be a part of the people that believe and know that black Americans have more to contribute so I want to get to this story because I think it really underscores what I'm saying we have a female rapper I don't even care to say her name um and she says in a video that she has murder on her mind as she twerks in front of Planned Parenthood take a listen [Music] [Applause] ing on my way to the clinic I forgot the plan B let's go I honestly like we we have to stop we have to stop I I can't we just let's just stop it there on the way to plan on the way to the clinic I got I got Murder on My Mind do I mean do you I do you have words I don't have them I really I don't have them and I am waiting for someone that feels that they are a better representation of Black Culture to speak out against this to recognize what it means when Planned Parenthood right is now getting exposure from black women that are half naked outside the same plan Planned Parenthood which as we have mentioned before on the show and as we will continue to mention Ad nauseam because facts and history matter that was created to stop black people from procreating now we have lizzo promoting Planned Parenthood now we have this rapper promoting Planned Parenthood making a mockery of the 18 million plus black American children that were killed inside of their mother's womb you want to know where the most unsafe place is for a black child that's not on the streets it's in their mother's wombs and it's because our culture is rotten our culture is training us to believe that we should be celebrating this immorality it is Despicable maybe somebody should join me in Having the courage to say it all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on Biden's recent 60 Minutes

it's personal story time my husband and i have an suv that is kept in an underground public garage about a week ago someone attempted to break into it fortunately all of the doors were locked and we had invested in shatterproof windows so despite cracking the exterior the would-be criminal was unsuccessful safe to say that we were glad we made that extra investment we were also glad the car doors were locked not that we would have deserved to have our car broken into if they weren't but it's of course always good to take necessary precautions years ago stuff like this used to be considered common sense across every category but at some point in the early 70s there was one space that marked itself safe from common sense the women's movement feminism around this time women began heavy talk about sexual freedom and positivity no longer would we be restrained by the ideas of yesteryear make him a sandwich he can make it himself i'll be outside naked the sexual freedom movement is what has brought us to this cultural moment of the day where if you'd like to you can attend ready a [\u00a0__\u00a0] march i'm not kidding there's an annual [\u00a0__\u00a0] march that takes place where women parade around half naked to remind you that they are free the idea is simple if you suggest to a woman that she shouldn't walk around half naked and drink just as an example because there are predators in the world then you would be the problem if that said woman decided anyways to go out to a bar half naked and she got inebriated and she landed herself into a terrible situation perhaps even leading to her sexual assault or rape it is in no way her fault you've heard the repeated short skirt analogy essentially if you believe there is anything that a woman could have done differently to prevent her own assault then you are a victim blamer or worse a rape apologist don't blame the short skirt blame the rapist no nuances applied of course if our suv was unlocked in a public garage with a stack of cash in the front seat and it was consequentially broken into the police might offer to us in the future you guys have really got to remember to lock your car door at night especially in these public lots that would be considered sound advice only a fool would shout back to that police officer burglar apologist but the messaging to young women today is radically different sexual freedom most nearly means throwing caution to the wind over the weekend i watched the docu-series entitled the secrets of playboy where former playmates and girlfriends of hugh hefner its famed founder spills on what life was actually like at the playboy mansion hefner for decades was credited in the media as a revolutionary the man who single-handedly ushered in positive sexuality his magazines gave us marilyn monroe and nicole smith pamela anderson women who showed us the way just how wonderful and glamorous and powerful embracing our sexuality could be these ladies were the precursor for the kim kardashians and the madonnas of the world setting the tone for women to display their bodies unapologetically turns out however that far from the happy storyline presented in the media what really went on in that mansion from the 70s and onward were parties drugs rape bestiality even women who were so drugged on the plenty of quaaludes that were funneled to them that they were instructed to and then filmed performing humiliating sex acts sometimes on dogs the men that visited the mansion could buy into this culture they could pay for a playboy membership which would give them access to anybody that they wanted hugh hefner according to his many girlfriends at least was a sexual deviant so deviant that he actually idolized charles manson he was obsessed with filming and taking pictures of women in compromised positions it was a combination of fear blackmail and eternal shame that led those women to be silent over the decades now who could have guessed that a man that walked around with barely clothed women that were half his age dressed as bunnies mind you was actually himself just a sick pervert who could have guessed that throwing parties with powerful men and naked women actually wasn't about freedom after all but actually the exact opposite sexual enslavement anybody with common sense could have guessed that that's who but common sense is not permitted remember its application would make you a rape apologist what was incredible to me is just how many of these women signed up for the playboy lifestyle all of them were deluded by the glossy glamour of its magazine somehow convinced by a false narrative that agreeing to take their clothes off in a mansion would somehow render them more freedom one former girlfriend spoke about how it was the famous women that made her aspire for that lifestyle and that right there is the thing the leaders of these absurd movements are of course always wealthy celebrities you log on to instagram today and you will find the world's top models half naked you can still find madonna who is almost 65 years old sitting on a bed with her legs spread open wide and fishnets ranting about sexism and the need to free the nipple it's always those wealthy feminist celebrities who spend millions of dollars a year on their private security that subliminally convince the younger poorer women that follow them to aspire to that brand of freedom take your clothes off free the nipples less is more it's just so much easier to throw caution to the wind when you've got money in the bank and a security detail waiting outside and it's only the underprivileged that blindly follow their lead those are the ones who suffer it's why i hate modern feminism because it all hinges on a lie all of this to say to the young women that follow me suffer no fools know that culture deludes celebrities delude fake pursuits of social justice on social media yeah that too it deludes what you should be doing is pursuing truth

degenerate what does it actually mean well as defined by Merriam-Webster it means either one having declined or become less specialized as in nature character structure or function from an ancestral or former State second definition is having sunk to a condition below that which is normal to a type especially having sunk to a lower and usually corrupt and vicious States you're sinking to a lower State I wanted to ask you that question because it's always on my mind I actually in my head I use that word probably more than I should but I think it's good for us to recognize degeneration when we see it so I'll sometimes just be looking at a piece of news and think wow what a total degenerate I mean that what this person is just degenerate right we have sort of lowered the bar here in terms of our society and I do think that American culture at its core has become degenerative thanks to the culture of Hollywood and thanks to the institution of Education which sort of celebrates all things corrupt and all things vicious and I was especially thinking about this because I had a chuckle I was tagged in something on Instagram it was the video of me talking about Kim Kardashian where I called her a prostitute and the comments were shockingly very positive everyone agreed with that statement but there was one woman who although she agreed with me saying that Kim Kardashian and her mother colluding to sell her sex tape was a form of prostitution she was upset that in that video I used the phrase out of wedlock sex I said her mother watched a video referring to Kris Jenner her mother watched a video of Kim Kardashian having out of wedlock sex with her boyfriend and the woman was upset by that she wrote oh okay Candace don't try to push your Christian views on people I just thought to myself what an absolute degenerate comment like why would you be upset maybe you don't believe that people need to wait until they are married to have sex but why would you be so upset to hear someone say out of wedlock sex that you you found it within you to comment on it and to say don't push your Christian views as if I'm the weirdo for saying as if that even belongs by the way just to Christianity as if morality now when we speak of things that are moral and at least things that are good to Aspire to right it's good to Aspire to wanting to have sexual relations with somebody who actually cares about you and wants to be with you for the rest of your life but now we're in this condition where it's like even mentioning that it they think that's dirty like oh my gosh like why would she I want my daughter to have sex with a ton of people before she gets married that was what I was getting from this woman right like how could you even mention out of wedlock sex Candace like it's better people to have tons of sex and then get married I mean what a what a degenerate but this as I said seems to be the state of things today in America and all around the world but of course you see it creeping up all throughout our culture and it's not just sexual relations and by the way don't forget I have told you guys a million times I'm not trying to be the person that oh I'm talking down to you and I'm of High Caliber morality I am a way better person today than I was when I was growing up actually I look back on the choices that I made when I was younger and I think wow I really gave in to a degenerate culture right I always say to people especially when I'm giving speeches I took the most liberal route to conservatism that there ever was because I was a product of my environment and my environment was liberalism my environment was growing up in a school system that celebrated promiscuity right like that woman in the comments don't even say out of wedlock sex it's not natural it's kind of the idea right I learned that in in health class that it was okay to have multiple partners as long as you were having safe sex it's totally fine to have multiple partners and it's old-fashioned it's old-fashioned to to think about out of wedlock sex right and it's not just sexual relationships that we've perverted to the point where people have this visceral response when you say something moral but it's even the institution of marriage right I was thinking about that because I saw a headline uh about Emily rata jakowski I think I'm saying her last name right she is you can describe her I guess as a partial actress her big break was in Robin Thicke's music video Blurred Lines if she was completely naked and she sort of just danced naked and topless in this video and she kind of has been dancing naked and topless through life you can go to her Instagram page I'm not painting her in any way that would upset her she's proud of the fact that she is always naked she views this as a form of power for women to be naked all the time so you can see like I said look you can look onto her Instagram page and for whatever reason her breasts are always out she she often has her butt in the air and she just takes these pictures I think the the slang the people are using today is it's a thirst trap right people it's to make people desire you on the internet and I saw a headline uh that she is married was married is getting divorced that her and her husband were divorcing and the headline was commenting on the fact it sounded like something that maybe came directly from her um that sources say sources might have been her but he's an absolute dog and he cheated on her right she she's leaving him because there's been infidelity in their marriage and I chuckled because I just I laughed in my head because I went oh yeah obviously she's always naked on the internet I mean what is it but an act of infidelity in your relationship if you are a married woman and you're constantly naked you're just forever naked on the internet people have this idea that they are I guess not responsible for their virtual Behavior like they do things online but they would never do in person it would be very bizarre right if you're a married woman and you're around a bunch of young guys not your husband and you strip down half naked and you put your button in the yeah they're just like hey guys what's up hey I'm Emma or you just took your top off and did this and just like covered basically your nipples and you were just like hey guys thirst trap but for whatever reason people have separated themselves they're like oh on Instagram it's totally fine for me to do this it's totally fine for men to lust about me all the time on the internet this is fine because it's just a picture and it's powerful somehow I like to say that you should perform on the Internet it's not a video game okay it's not a video game you don't get to create an avatar of yourself on Instagram and then say Oh that's different no no you should as I like to say behave on Instagram behave on Facebook behave on Twitter behave on the internet as you would in real life right so yeah I I could entirely believe that he was cheating on her because she has been cheating on him in my mind right I feel like I've had sex with Emily ronajkowski every time I'm on the internet and I see her her boobs are out we've all been we've all slept in some capacity with Emily rojakowski I believe she has absolutely no respect for her relationship and how she acts but I guess it was his act of infidelity in what she perceives to be the real world the virtual world is fine her video game character is fine but in the real world you know that's where it actually caused harm to her relationship and now she's bravely leaving him what a degenerate what an absolute General in my mind this is a degenerated this marriage has generated and you guys have both accepted these terms but this is kind of I'm commenting on that because this is where our society is for whatever reason we we glorify behavior that is obviously degenerate um as just one example there was an actress named Chloe Moretz she was young at the time she was 19 years old and she somehow got into a Twitter spat with the Kardashian family and she was commenting on this sort of pornographic online world and she said she responded to Kim Kardashian who had put a picture of herself naked kind of you know thirst trap hashtag thirst trap here I am naked uh this time Kim was married um and but fully frontal naked with two black stripes to cover the parts that were too rude for Instagram or that Twitter would have pulled down and Chloe Grace responded to this completely fully frontal naked picture and she said Kim I truly hope you realize this is a tweet I truly hope you realize how important setting goals are for young women teaching them that we have so much more to offer than our bodies wow what a beautiful tweet from a teenager that is just saying hey you know you have a huge following and you you can offer more you can offer your intellect you are a beautiful woman like but also you could you could give more of you offer your marketing skills offer something else this is to me a kind tweet saying we can all aspire to do better this is regenerative right she's basically saying this is kind of generate but you're capable of more but in response uh Kim wrote back let's all welcome Chloe Moretz to Twitter since no one knows who she is your nylon cover is cute boo what what like Okay so let's just attack this teenager at the time she might have been 20 I think I believe she was 19 was in 2016 and she's 25 today um let's attack her because she asked you to stop being a general in the kindest possible terms ever right and then that wasn't enough to just say oh nobody knows who you are so I'm gonna be fully frontal naked it wasn't enough for her to do that she then teamed up with Emily rochukowski who I told he was always naked and they were like yeah more power to us girls they're naked on the internet they teamed up and they both then posted this photo of them topless on the internet and they are giving the middle finger so it's an F you to Chloe because like I don't know she asked you guys to stop being degenerate and this is uh so emblematic of the world that we live in today and by the way the newspapers the magazines they applauded Kim they quoted Kim and Emily for this action of like whoa slapped her down whoop slap down that morality whoa this girl tried to comment on degenerates and nope nope nope we are being degenerate out in the open we do not care like yes go us grown adult women who are both married and like who cares who is this who knows you boo who even knows who you are boo yeah that's where we are at I say we talk about generation why we talk about talk about Generation X but we now live in generation d generates that's all the time we have for you today if you want me to answer your questions send them to my email address Candace dailywire.com or you can DM the show Instagram handle that is at Canada show thank you for joining me today come back tomorrow for an all new episode at 2PM [Music] thank you", "ZKxl49wzjWA": "so you know that I have spoken to you guys about how our culture is becoming desensitized to pornography now you can find that on one of my episodes we've talked about how really everything is poor when you look around why not have a Congressional candidate that releases a sex tape then right because that's what's happening a New York Congressional candidate has released a tape of himself having sex on PornHub why because he wants to promote his sex positive agenda which includes the legalization of prostitution his name is Mike itkus and he is a third party liberal candidate of course he's a liberal candidate in New York's 12th District and a current major in the U.S Army Reserve he is running to unseat Jerry Nadler in November and he achieved ballot access in September one of his key campaign issues is to decriminalizing sex work so to promote it he decided the best way to do that would be to participate in an adult film and he posted that to Pornhub on his own account and it really is something first and foremost in the bio I just want to be clear I did not watch this I'm just telling you guys this is what has happened and the bio who describes himself as not married no kids not celibate and atheist emphasis on the atheist of course of course he has to be an atheist because he's also a narcissist he stars with Nicole sage in the X-ray clip which features the pair having sex on camera twice over the course of the past year the video is about 13 minutes long and it opens with the performer Sage clarifying that she consents to the scene and is not under the influence of drugs or alcohol see that's why it's not a problem that they're having sex on camera and that he could potentially be your government because she consents right kiss then walks into the scene and clarifies the two have also been tested for STDs and they've established a safe word as well and that safe word is stop after the initial scene ends a video cuts to the pair again fully clothed and they have subtitled it Los Angeles California October 2021 before establishing consent again and going back to performing um a lot that I want to say about this I wish that we as a society could use our safe word stop when it comes to the grotesqueness of these politicians I don't know why people are becoming more and more extreme and it's hard to choose between who would be worse you know Jerry Nadler Humpty Dumpty Nadler I know name calling isn't nice but you'll recall what he did to me when I was in Congress he's a rude awful horrible individual or your other option is this guy who is now a porn star or because he wants you to understand that sex is so great that why aren't congressional candidates showing you how great sex Works can be sex work can be totally neglecting the truth about sex work which is that of course A lot of these individuals that partake in it do so because they are desperate totally neglecting the very high suicide rates of most porn actresses because they engage in this because they're desperate for cash and then when they get that cash they can't turn to any other career path because they're known as porn stars so he neglects that conversation and wants you to know that sex work is is real work right that's what they're saying all the time sex work is real work yeah it's of course a horrible horrible thing that has taken place and it really is of course a sign of the times so what's going to happen would you choose Jerry natal or you're going to choose this guy Mike it kiss we can keep an eye on that story the Democrats are just becoming disgusting another story that I wanted to bring to your attention because it it angers me a lot and it should anger you and I don't know how it works when there is an actual judge that should be put in prison but there is a judge that should be put in prison and he resides in North Carolina listen to the story a father of one spent 24 hours in jail because he refused to wear a mask as was ordered by a judge despite the fact that there is no state or County mandates in the place right so his name is Gregory Hahn he's 47 years old he's a U.S Navy veteran so someone that we should respect highly because he has served this country so he was among several of 98 jury duty candidates that was called to the Harnett County court and he showed up not wearing a mask because there were no such rules or warnings in place but despite the fact that masks are not required in the building judge Winston Charles who's just an activist Winston Charles Gilchrist he mandated that everyone in his courtroom must wear a mask because why not I'm a king I'm just going to make rules that don't exist right everybody hop on one foot I'm the judge do what I say there's no rules or laws to say you have to do this but do it and so Han did the right thing and refused the judge warned him that he would be held in contempt of court and could spend a month in jail if he didn't put a mask on but this guy's tough obviously right and he refused to back down he said that he told the judge I'm not going to wear a mask and the judge ordered 24 hours in Harnett County Jail Han told Tucker Carlson as he was recalling the 24 hours that he spent in prison that it was the worst 24 hours of his life he said he had to make a phone call to his minor child who was at home think about how horrible that is he said quote I got motioned and I got changed into an orange uniform I got a roll of toilet paper toothpaste towel grabbed a mat and I'm walking with inmates to a cell I never thought this could happen in this country Han added well let me tell you something it can't happen in this country we are seeing that we are treading towards people that believe that they are dictators right issuing mandates sweeping mandates I'm the governor and I've decided this is how I'm going to rule the states and it's by taking power away from you I know there's no law that says I can do this but who cares right the people are realizing that we as a society have been under duress because nobody is abiding by the Constitution anymore nobody is abiding by even laws that are put in place anymore this judge just decided to be a dictator in his courtroom and he made a person that he should have had the UT most respect for right individual that he should have said thank you for your service to nope he tortured him and made him spend 24 hours into prison because he didn't wear a mask and I guess masks work or whatever in his courtroom it's ridiculous and this judge should face consequences so I want to share that story with you so that we can become our own sort of activists and demand that that judge receives some sort of justice for these actions all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about the most popular app among kids and teens it's called be real have you heard of it and there are some very serious safety risks that you need to know about so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "k81XzImW1Ck": "happy Fridays ladies and gents I don't mean to sound like a pharmaceutical commercial my question of the day today is do you or somebody that you love suffer from porn addiction I'm being serious I want to talk today about porn addiction plus the left ruins everything we know that if you had a good childhood they're going to ruin it and this includes Tim Burton's hit Netflix series The Addams Family reboot because they're upset that he has casted that they've casted black actors as bullies so yeah they're going to have something to say about that and so do I all that more today on Candace Owens [Music] okay so why is porn addiction on my mind today well if you have been listening to this podcast for 50 some episodes in you know that I frequently talk about the topic of porn because it's ruining marriages it's ruining relationships and it's never been more abundant it's also becoming darker the topic and the areas of pornography are becoming darker which is why we talk about how the top trends on pornhub.com are all incestuous it seems almost like they're giving people sick ideas so I was thinking about this this morning however because I saw an article pertaining to Sandra Bullock's ex I'm going to remind you about him in case you don't remember she used to be married to Jesse James Jesse James runs West Coast Choppers and they had what seemed to be like a very beautiful marriage not likely it was kind of like Beast with Belle you know she's just very beautiful glamorous woman a good woman by all accounts one of the rare celebrities that doesn't seem to make everybody angry by being overly virtuous this and then operating like a psychopath in her personal capacity so she's just a likable individual she's married to him he kind of rough around the edges but they had a very quiet relationship and they kind of stayed away from the prying eye of Paparazzi and then there was this explosion of news that he was actually cheating on her and it wasn't as though he was cheating on her with just one individual he was cheating on her multiple times suddenly a ton of women came forward and said I had an affair with him too I had an affair with him too and this was sad because she had helped him in terms of getting custody of his child that he had in a prior relationship I think the the child's the daughter's name was sunny and she had grown very close to the daughter and she had just been such a good woman and it just seemed to to this this miraculous Fall From Grace almost in terms of her marriage and she handled it very well buttoned up never really spoke to the Press about it and moved on in her life and she's now obviously much happier and better for it but Jesse James is back in the news again because he is being accused of cheating by his pregnant wife so what has he been up to since his uh fall of Grace from his relationship with Sandra Bullock while Jesse James went on to have a relationship with Kat Von D he was engaged to her he then that really she fell apart because he was cheating got married to a woman named Alexis dejoria that relationship fell apart because he was cheating on her with multiple women he then recently in June of this year fell in love with a former porn star her name she goes by Bonnie Rotten and they were very happily married in the yard in Texas a backyard wedding and then she finds out that he is cheating on her with a ton of women and Bonnie Rotten has now taken to her Instagram in a series of stories uh to announce first and foremost that she's pregnant she used a sonogram picture to say I'm you know essentially I'm paraphrasing here I am pregnant and he's cheating on me she wrote exactly quote Jesse is busy trying to F other women while I am pregnant she also said she called him a truly disgusting human being and said that she was quote so hurt by everything that he has done to me she said I do not like putting this SHP on social media but it's the only way he will feel anything is if everyone knows what he truly is and then it's kind of quite sad because she then admits that people are going to laugh at her because he has a very well established pattern of behavior everybody knows that there is clearly something wrong with him he routinely cheats on women and he keeps getting caught women keep marrying him keep falling in love with him she then wrote quote everyone can laugh at me make fun of me whatever you want to say nothing will make me feel worse than how I truly feel right now I should have known better you are all right so I want to talk about this story because my first inkling was to sort of not laugh at her but just to go I mean what have we been talking about as I said he has an established pattern of behavior we know who he is we know that he's a truly disgusting human being how could she have fallen for this trap but then I felt tremendous sympathy for her because first and foremost the idea of being pregnant 10 weeks pregnant and just finding out that you're about to bring life into this world just having gotten married thinking about you're doing things the right way I got married I fell in love I'm having a baby and then only to discover that the person you're having a baby with is having multiple Affairs and then what she goes on to to explain he's blocked her on all social media platforms so she he's not even listening to her and it's a lot of emotion for any person to go through and as you guys know if you're listening to my podcast you know that I'm tremendously sympathetic to porn stars after having had a discussion with a former porn star that then turned his life around and became a pastor as he explained that a lot of these women that get into porn are the most desperate people they come from very impoverished backgrounds usually from very abusive backgrounds and they are basically selling their body as a last resort a lot of them are addicted to drugs to be able to get them to perform their drugs out of their minds and that they also have a tremendously High suicide rate because even if they are able to earn enough money via pornography they can't really change their life around right it's very very hard for a girl to say hey I was yeah I did a couple of porn films I did porn for 10 years but now I like to get an office job people find the stuff online and it's it's just sort of a slime that exists and has to follow them throughout life that they are kind of considered to be a disgusting right considered to be prostitutes you sold your body for money and so because once they realize that they can't turn their lives around they become suicidal which is to me very sad so I'm very sympathetic towards porn stars I feel very sad for her for having gone through this and then I was thinking about Jesse James now I'm going to be honest that every time I come across a story when there is a man that very clearly has sex addiction which Jesse James clearly has my instinct is to be repulsed and I think that that's fair I think there's something about taking your clothes off and having intimate sex with a bunch of different partners especially when you have a wife right it just makes me it makes me want to puke it makes me I feel physically ill by that concept that someone could do this that there's something that is so wrong with them in their minds that they can just routinely do this over and over again and it's an addiction that they have and but when I was talking about this and I was reading this story a part of me also felt very sympathetic to him too because our instincts are to dismiss people that have porn addiction as being disgusting right they're the dregs of society how disgusting you just can't keep your you can't keep it in your pants right you're going around you're having sex with a bunch of different partners who could feel bad for you you're getting the sex and yet we feel differently when we talk about addicts when it comes to the opioid crisis people that are addicted to pills allergic to anything else that people are alcoholics we want them to get better right suddenly Society is on their side it's you gotta check into rehab you got to get your life together yeah we may feel like okay it's a little ridiculous that you have a drug addiction but we're rooting for that person to get better and we're not so dismissive and I think that we need to change that and when I read this article the first thing that I said to my producers I'd like to get him on to my monthly series taboo to have a longer discussion because clearly this man is suffering he's he's sick this is a sick man and I don't say that in a way to denigrate his character whatsoever I say this because this is an illness and we start to have to start looking at this as an illness in fact one of my producers said to me because we were talking about just pornography in general when kids first start watching porn maybe as a teenager if you're a young man how much more available it all is now think about this this is this was unfathomable when we were growing up when I was a child we didn't all have smartphones these kids now all have smartphones they're on Instagram they're on Tick Tock sex is everywhere sex is suddenly what sells it wasn't what was needed to sell things just a few short decades ago and now God forbid you're selling a purse for whatever reason there has to be a naked woman behind it right so men are having this constant response to seeing women that are attractive constantly selling them things and seeing women that are using their bodies on Instagram to get attention and and who are they getting attention from Men Women of course as well but sexual desire from men is what allows what allowing these women to sustain their platforms and to in turn make money and so then a guy who Maybe is getting a tease of something on Instagram right they're following Kim Kardashian they're following all these other women that put their bodies on the internet then pivots away for something a bit more severe and they start watching pornography and they can do it now that quickly just have to go on to a website and you can watch porn all day that is it and you have to hide you feel ashamed but you are stepping into what is becoming a pornographic addiction and I think that this problem based on the discussions that I'm having with so many people is much more abundant than I ever realized right in having that backstage discussion that we talked about a couple of months ago that a lot of people are suffering in their marriages because of this addiction Kanye West now known as yay being among them he has spoken openly about how he feels that his pornography addiction that he's had since he was young is something that ultimately ruined his marriage but because there aren't enough examples of people in this public sphere talking about how difficult this is there aren't enough men that are talking about how hard it is for them not to take in from pornography in their spare time we keep treating these people like deviants I think that we need to stop that right and I want to be among the first people to stop it I want people especially the men that are listening to the show and the women that write into the show who talk about these problems with me about how their husbands perhaps have a porn addiction not to feel like it's like it's dirty right it is a true addiction it is a mental addiction and it's not going to get better if we keep treating these people like the scholars of our society we need to have the conversation openly and recognize that what is feeding this addiction is the complicitness the marketing the marketing of every brand is complicit in this porn addiction these social media companies are complicit in this porn addiction and a lot of these individuals are in fact victims of this addiction so I'm not saying this to make it seem like oh we need to all be so sympathetic towards Jesse James Jesse James today to check into rehab as he liked he once did once upon a time when he was exiting his marriage with Sandra Bullock he needs to seek help but we as a society need to be more open to understanding that they need help not further denigration and that's all that I have to say about that profiling surveillance data harvesting these are a lot of things I don't like about tech Giants but there's only so much that I can do because I don't have 44 billion dollars to buy up Twitter the good news is that you don't have to be a billionaire to take a stand for less than seven dollars per month you can join me in fight back against big Tech by using expressvpn big tech companies make

Candace okay now it's time for some topics to do [Music] all right guys first story in a rare W for lizard boy Mark Zuckerberg has actually slammed Apple amid the company's Feud with Elon Musk so of course apple is sort of saying they're very interested in content moderation especially when they can't control people are saying they notoriously kicked parlor out of the App Store and essentially you will play by the left's rules or apple will kick you out that's essentially what we have come to understand and of course they're kind of squeezing in all of them on Elon Musk right now because they're realizing that he's not playing the game of the left and Mark Zuckerberg actually had something negative to say about Apple so let's listen to him in his own words Windows Android iOS hopefully the future ones around the metaverse that will get built Apple's stands out as the only one where one company can control what what apps get on the device right that wasn't the case in Windows that isn't really the case on on Android phones and Google mic control goes in the in the in the Play Store but they've always made it so you could sideload and have other app stores I do think Apple has sort of singled themselves out as the only company that is trying to control um like unilaterally what what apps get on a device and I don't think that's a sustainable or good place to be it's sort of shocking to hear him say something and to Echo the sentiments of how everybody has been feeling and of course you want to go yay good for Mark Zuckerberg for Having the courage to do this this isn't courage just so we're clear what's actually happening is that Elon Musk has done something courageous it takes somebody to stand up and be the hero in order to inspire others to do the same and I have talked about this in the past when it was so fashionable for people to condemn Jack Dorsey I was very honest and saying that I actually met Jack Dorsey a couple of times I met him through Kanye at least he was known as Kanye West during that time he gave him my number we met up a couple of times I actually went to Twitter headquarters back when I was before I was at Daily wire and Jack Dorsey despite what people think I think that he's like this radical leftist activist was not that he was a man that was being held hoshish at his own company Jack Dorsey actually very much believes in free speech but he was always sort of this quiet techie guy just what you would imagine doesn't like the cameras doesn't like attention he's not a Mark Zuckerberg who tends to love the spotlight and I think that he completely caged the pressure at his own company and he allowed these people to kind of flood it and tell him how it was going to be run if he wanted Twitter to be able to sustain itself and he allowed that to happen because he was a coward not because he was a bad person um now can cowardice lead to bad things absolutely we're living in those times right now we it all it takes as that fashionable quote says is for good men to do nothing for bad things to take place and in the circumstance what's happening in social media I think what it really amounts to is a bunch of good men that did nothing like Jack Dorsey who was too scared to do anything and now you have Elon Musk who's not that right you have somebody who's saying no we need free speech if we don't have free speech if America doesn't have free speech then the West will fall and he's been right and so he's done something tremendously heroic and in doing that has given the permission for other CEOs who have felt the squeeze to say yeah no maybe maybe I'll pop my head up and actually say what I really think and what I really believe that this is not a sustainable model that Apple actually shouldn't have the right to decide who gets to have an app right we're talking about the free markets I don't understand how this has been allowed to go on for so long and So speaking truth to power although it is too late as I said represents a rare W for lizard boy moving on you guys uh the woke mob you know what I think about them they ruin everything I don't know it's just like anything we ever liked in life they just suddenly go back and pull out the old DVDs and the old vhs's they just go nope I don't like it it's ruined they're just ruining our childhood for fun I guess anything that we used to like and that wasn't problematic well they have found something else to slam and it is Tim Burton's Smash Hit Netflix Adams Family reboot who didn't love The Adams Family the creepy and their cookie mysterious and spooky they're all together ookie The Addams Family like you feel better because I just sang that and you're probably going how to achieve a novel lyrics to it that was amazing Candace is amazing yeah I know it's pretty amazing we're all feeling great except the woke mob is angry they're angry so what could they be angry about it's The Addams Family everybody loves Wednesday she's perpetually not happy while they're angry because in this reboot they cast black people but those black actors are the bullies and so that's problematic and it's problematic it's problematic if you don't cast black people of course that's racism but it's also problematic if you do cast black people of course that's racism so basically you got to figure out how not to be a racist and there there's no new as you are no matter what going to be a racist but you got to work to not be racist in a world where everything is racist so if you move into a black neighborhood you're gentrifying it and that's racist but if you move out of a black neighborhood that's the white flight and that's also racist you got to figure out where to live no matter where you live it's going to be racism because it's everywhere and it's abundant and obviously Tim Burton is a racist so this Twitter user who happened to be named Jack not Dorsey wrote quote Tim Burton casts black people finally and makes them Pilgrim villains y'all can't tell me that man isn't insufferable and racist as hell in real life um uh you're correct I can't tell you that I can tell you you're probably insufferable Tim Burton as I remember him just kind of makes people a weird spooky color he's got like he like Adam's family is right on par with Tim Burton because he does cartoons and I don't know when we started racializing cartoons or why there's so much beef in these non-existing characters but here we are because we have a bunch of people that can't enjoy The Adams Family which everybody enjoyed so there you go it's ruined here's another person's tweet don't get me wrong I love Jenna Ortega in that she's playing Wednesday but one thing I hate about this show is that why did they make all the black people in this show terrible people the disgruntled Twitter user wrote like how did Netflix see nothing wrong with this here's the thing The Adams Family in general I don't really think there's any nice characters it's The Adams Family so I think everyone's a little dark Wednesday's depressed child so if there's a white person cast that's Wednesday why they gotta make the white people the depressed child let's just keep being upset about everything and by the way what about the hand the little hand Critter like well I mean who wants to just be a hand who just wants to be a freaking hand that's been chopped off from an arm okay there's really no really warm characters in The Adams Family so I'm not really sure what you guys are upset about but I'm never really sure what you guys are upset about so there is that all right I have a question for you who is going to raise your kids if you are not around to raise them you know as well as I do that none of us are going to live forever and it's dark to think about it but there are some tough decisions that you should be thinking about like if you'd like life support or not and who would be speaking to the doctors on

episode of high low with mrata host Emily rajakowski is talking to a former sex worker Mia Khalifa in case you guys don't know who she is uh she's actually been very interesting Mia Khalifa was a younger porn star and she essentially said that she only did x amount of videos I'm making up a number here but it was very few it was like 12 and it completely ruined her life and she made no money um from it whatsoever and she's kind of been using her platform since to talk about how horrible the porn industry is and how it women are suffering under it that doesn't even make economic sense for the majority of them a lot of them are unwitting participants so I actually deeply respect her for doing this um talking about this topic which most people just sort of dismiss porn stars uh but Mia Khalifa is has is appearing on this podcast with Emily rojakowski and the two of them are talking about men dating younger women or people in general that are dating with a wide age Gap and the opinion that Mia Khalifa expressed and that Emily Rada was in accordance with has upset the internet so I will let you take a listen to that right now any guy who goes after a girl significantly younger than them is severely lacking in their life and I I mean that confidence wise I mean like they are falling short in so many places that that is the only place they can turn to to feel like they have they have something on the scale of power and it's I mean ultimately it's predatory I mean there's just no way to kind of because you're manipulating someone who is not aware of what they're giving you and it's unfair so I don't entirely disagree with the conversation that they're having the first thing that I'll say is I think that Mia is coming from this genuinely where she has seen the insides of an industry where a lot of young women are being taken advantage of and she's giving her opinion that men in power tend to go after really young women uh Emily rojakowski is dealing with her divorce we know that Sebastian bear cheated on her probably with the younger woman so she's nodding her head and agreeing not because she has a thoughtful opinion but because she wants to believe that her husband is a monster and not just that they were in a very dysfunctional relationship but on the topic of people dating with really big age gaps I think there's probably a little more Nuance I find it problematic and I do think that it probably does remark on confidence and a power structure when you have a person like Scott Disick you know he's a part of the Kardashian Clan Courtney Kardashian's baby daddy he makes me uncomfortable he does I find it very weird that he waits for young women to turn 18 and the moment that they turn 18 He dates them he did this uh with Sophia Richie and he's had a slew of other other women who he stated that literally the day they turn 19 suddenly Scott Disick is dating us if he was waiting for their birthday to go off and then it doesn't make sense like what does a 40 year old man he's 40 have in common or what is he even discussing with an 18 year old girl it doesn't make sense I'm 33 and the idea of me going on a date with an 18 year old boy and I say boy because that is how I would feel about an 18 year old boy it does it just doesn't make sense and the idea that she's 18 but she's so mature and has experience I'm not really buying into that I think it's problematic when you're dating people that are closer in age to your son Miss Mason Disick who I think is maybe uh 12 or something like that than they are to you so that I do think that that is a power thing and there's a confidence thing and there's something that just creeps me out about it and I'm not trying to be judgmental it's creepy I thought very creepy when Celine Dion married that old man named Renee I mean she was 14 when he was sitting on her I think that she's a victim I I know because I was 18 at one point a girl's mind is just not fully developed when she's 18 years old she's she is for lack of a better word a child and things are a little different I mean those years are very significant the difference between even an 18 year old and a 22 year old is is astounding there's a lot more life experience that goes into that period because obviously you're leaving your household when you're 18. if you're going to college that is you're going to University you have a little more life experience you're not living under your parents protection so I I do agree that it can sometimes be weird but there are also people that have age gaps and they're completely irrelevant I think if you're talking just about really young women there are definitely questions to be asked about what the man is looking for in that relationship now saying all that also want to say that it's not weird that men like younger women so if you're talking about a 65 year old man and he's gone after a uh 26 year old younger woman it's like that age Gap okay it is stupid we know why he's with her it's because she's hot and she's young and men like hot girls like I like good food so what's not problematized the fact that people prefer a older man would prefer a girl that's better looking you would hope that he would have the emotional maturity to stay with somebody and to grow into old age and still see those Beauties and I think that a spiritual connection is so much more important than a physical connection for those very reasons is he the best guy no is it understandable why a guy might like a younger woman with a larger age gap between the two of them absolutely so you can give me your comments and yell at me and disagree but that's my stance on the discussion that they had moving on guys we promised you that we would do one happy story per a day that would just make you feel good and we are we are completely looking in every pocket of the internet to find feel good stories and this one one's great guys the black rhino populations are starting to thrive in Zimbabwe for the first time in decades isn't that amazing the Rhino population has surpassed more than a thousand for the first time in more than 30 years according to the international Union for conservation of nature species this includes 614 black and 415 white rhinos listed as critically endangered so now there's more black and white rhinos and that to me I have nothing bad to say feels like a win for Mitt Romney and Tim Scott's of the world the Rhino population going up gosh I promised I was going to stay nice but happy so what's wrong with me that's all I have to say about that okay now it's time for the daily comment Roundup so let's see what is on your mind as opposed to what is on my mind first comment is from Ryan hole and he is responding to the segment about Julia Fox who just screamed and said that the problem isn't pedophilia I'm paraphrasing her it's men and pedophiles are everywhere so don't look at Hollywood or something like that uh Ryan says the issue is men I tell you men also Julia Fox why am I so lonely yeah so true uh she's probably lonely because she's crazy and both men and women can see that so good luck to her in her dating future next comment from a user entitled Johnny Appleseed and this is regarding my comment that I do think that is a bit hypocritical when people say that they are pro-life and pro-death penalty Johnny Appleseed disagrees he says for once I completely disagree with Candace there's a huge difference in murdering an innocent developing child in the womb and putting child molesters rapists and heinous murderers to death I am pro-life for The Unborn and 100 in support of the death penalty for heinous Defenders not having the death penalty for heinous crimes incentivizes people to commit more of them and we spend sixty thousand dollars a year to keep murderers molesters and rapists alive in prison I've never made that much money working any job I've ever had it's a disgrace to humanity and it's sustainable to keep Wicked violent criminals alive yeah you know we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one I just find it to be ideologically inconsistent and as I mentioned in a prior episode the fact that they've gotten it wrong so many times it's a problem I'm sorry imagine that there are people that have been put to death and they actually didn't commit the crime the science wasn't even good in the forensics weren't even good enough back in the day to be able to determine whether people had committed crimes it was very much a whodunit it might have been him and they were sentencing people also now you think okay well that sort of stuff wouldn't happen today sometimes people were literally sentenced just because of the color of their skin because our government was so judgmental and hated people and when we have a political system that is as rotten as it is today I don't really want politicians and judges who are bought and paid for having the ability to make these sorts of decisions I really don't I think especially after January 6th I just I'm not in support of it I don't support the death penalty I know that that is something that people disagree with as you have done but I don't think that I could ever I don't think think that it is right for us to think that we should judge whether a non-individual should live I think that you leave it to God and Mal there's other things you can do by the way I mean listen you could castrate them you know if they've committed the heinous act you can castrate them maybe we need to eye for the eye Until the Whole World Turns blind or something I think there's a lot of things and by the way as I said before death is an easy way out these people are getting injections and they're going to sleep but they're getting their teeth pulled it's it's a very easy way out when you commit a heinous violent crime and you're told you're gonna have to go to sleep for a little bit and all you feel is a little injection I mean how much suffering is that person really living with while the family that has potentially survived the crime or knows what you know what happened to a loved one who was murdered by this person has to live on forever and those memories of what their what their loved one lives through live with them so I don't I don't think that it even necessarily gets back at the individual for the violent crimes next comment is from Sierra Jones she's really fired up uh because she feels that I have defended Nick Cannon having multiple baby mamas which I did not defend that whatsoever but her comment is Candace what has happened to you he has said some really disgusting things about white people you have a white husband and a mixed son he also has numerous baby mamas one of his baby mamas lost their child not long after the baby was born and Nick left her to have another family honestly lately you have been talking nonsense how is he meant to be a proper father when he has multiple kids with multiple women a father belongs to this household Nick has multiple he is not a good role model everyone has good qualities even the worst people out there doesn't mean that they are a good person or someone should look up to I'm pretty sure I did not describe him as being a good role model of a father I am very strong in my opinions about families needs to be together what I said was that as a whole I do not think Nick Cannon is a bad person he doesn't bring bad ideas into the public sphere in terms of a lot of the hip-hop artists which he is he's he represents the exact opposite he sort of has a family-friendly show and I mentioned the fact that one of the baby mamas multiple baby mamas have said that he is very good to them good to the children that he somehow is able to make time and I'm not it's not a good model for a family but relative to all the evil that we're fighting today Nick Cannon is just isn't on my list he's just he's not on my little list I don't know what to say now regarding you saying that he has said some really disgusting things about white people I haven't heard them that may be true please do not assume that I have watched every bit of footage regarding Nick Cannon if he has said horrible things about white people I will look into it and I will condemn those horrible things about why people obviously you know I don't condone saying horrible things about people least of all based on the color of their skin but I think you can say that of all the evil that we're fighting today you know Nick Cannon not Chief among it so I respect your comments Sierra I hope that you respect my response to it next comment is regarding how do you know something is racist interchange black and white so I said that on my show if you want to wonder whether or not something is racist just remove the word black or white and interchange them and if it sounds racist it is so if you say as a buzzfeed article I think once the headline said white people need to just shut up or stop talking and this was in like Peak BLM era and I just said if that headline read black people need to just stop talking the world would be on fire so I think it's a pretty easy thing Raquel says they have a segment on my kids cartoon channel that says rise rise my black Sunshine that made me laugh Sunshine maybe it's just the contradiction just a little paradoxical the rise rise my black sunshine and it's called black girls time which not that that's wrong but it makes it wrong when you flip it saying white girl time I completely agree that it should be that simple yeah I mean rise rise my white Sunshine followed by white girl time and the world would be on fire they would just burn down that kid's cartoon immediately because it's just not acceptable like it should just be rice rise sunshine and just be girls time and even that is unacceptable these days because we don't know what a girl is we don't know what a woman is we don't know anything next comment is regarding Biden paying one billion dollars in climate reparations of course he's not going to pay or take a billion dollars in client reparations he's going to steal from us that's what they do Isabelle hilling says so they deny a recession but accept that other countries are suffering financially and send everything every and send everything elsewhere what in the world is going on to the Liberals that care so much about these communities and support this I dare you to go and volunteer and help our own people but oh that's right they would never yeah they would never that is true there's something about the left that they resent Americans that they they hate Americans they don't see American Family suffering and for some reason they feel it's very virtuous if you send money overseas even though obviously these countries are not doing anything with that money these politicians are recycling it and sending it back to our politicians and we are all being caught up in this money laundering scheme that has gone on for decades so yeah it is unfortunate uh but I think what's happening is that more and more people are leaving the left because of this when they're realizing that they don't even have enough money to fill up their tank and they're being preached at and told that they need to somehow give more or support people overseas that aren't actually being supported final comment this is regarding Olivia Wilde and Harry Styles breakup which is surprising to No One least of all me Anthony Brown says these relationships in Hollywood are PR songs they really don't have a choice in who they date let alone have sex with that's part of the trade when you sell your soul for fame and riches you give up autonomy of your thoughts and your body it's the vast majority of people in Hollywood are in these arranged relationships even if they can't stand each other let me add it's really sad because a lot of these men and women are gay but are forced into heterosexual issues because of Optics I agree with part of this some relationships are in fact real in Hollywood uh I know that because I know people in Hollywood who have fallen in love with one another and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't but it is authentic in the beginning but I also agree that some of these are PR relationships I think that CAA which obviously is a huge celebrity PR firm quite literally tells women that for their careers it will be better if they date somebody that is exactly what is the arrangement for Leonardo DiCaprio there are unknown models they're told you date him for a little bit and then you'll become a known model and that has been the circumstance every woman woman the Leonardo DiCaprio has dated has given up a couple years of her life before she turns 22 and then she goes on to have a tremendous career and so yeah it is a form of sale I guess is the best way to say it and what I will say is the Harry Styles Olivia initially I thought she was just well she is crazy but honestly I thought she was just crazy but in reality I'm realizing that she's a bit more cunning than I had given her credit for and that she just wanted her movie to do well she knew that he was a pop star he just wants to add acting to his resume he's been very interested in acting it was a perfect exchange for them to Simply pretend to date for a little bit really to turn on the turn the heat up from the paparazzi leading up to their movie and then to go their separate ways almost immediately after so kudos to Olivia Wilde for being a bit of a fox much more cunning than I had initially suspected alright so you guys know I love expressvpn because it keeps my data safe and secure I use it on all of my devices and highly suggest that you should do

read them out loud they were despicable but virtually every link was incest right almost incest I should say it was stepbrother does this with his stepsister or stepmom does this with her stepson which of course is now something that is entering the minds of individual and you can see this even in advertisements on Instagram something that I've noticed as just one conversation is that the Kardashian sisters whenever they promote a product they are half naked and they are with each other and they are touching almost literally up against each other's crotches it's very strange thing I have two sisters never in my life would I get down to my underwear and seductively hold my sister while her legs are open but these are the ads that are appearing now for I don't know lipstick", "PhPrj9fQGmQ": "yes Kim Kardashian posts nude photos all the time barely covering her nipples barely covering her private parts and somehow it's allowed to stand last week we also covered that strange photo the photos that Madonna posts on Instagram she is basically naked she's in fishnet she's wearing a thong she's under a bed she has her full fake ass in the air because she got I decided at the age of 63 years old she decided that she needed to get butt implants and all that's allowed on Instagram it's allowed as long as you don't show the nipple you can put whatever pornography that you basically want Instagram so why come down on the sex workers who don't make as much money as the billionaire Kardashians who don't make as much money as Madonna why are we coming down there needs to either be a real standard right or there should be no double standards we just need to have a real standard to not allow pornography on the internet", "DhQVkXg1YT4": "so i want to talk about kim kardashian uh because this story just keeps getting darker and i actually can't believe the information um that has been exposed about her uh if you don't know who kim kardashian is bless you honestly i don't know how you could potentially not know who she is she is essentially um forced upon us by the mainstream media i feel as though every other article pertains to the kardashian sisters and i'm going to tell you how she arrived on the scene if you already know the story bear with me but i'm sure many of my listeners bless them do not kim kardashian had a boyfriend he was at that time he still is a rapper and an entertainer he goes by the name of ray j she was dating her boyfriend okay and they decided to record themselves having sex now this was a personal tape meant just for both of them and eventually this tape got leaked right so kim kardashian had a show that was coming out and eventually this tape got leaked and her and ray j had split up every implication on the show which tracked her finding out that this tape was going to come out uh indicated to the masses that her ex-boyfriend ray j leaked it and she was horrified by it she cried for years episode after episode about how this could possibly be happening to her and if you were watching this show as i was when i was younger you were sympathetic to her you actually thought to yourself this is horrible situation i mean she has a right to have sex with her boyfriend and nobody would want to know that something that was personal to you was then released for to the public and now people are watching her so you felt sympathetic to her right well recently and now this is some 20 years later i believe 20 years later ray j is watching an episode of her new show and she again reintroduces the narrative of her as a victim of the sex tape that got released and ray j who is now much older and has a daughter who was able to watch this show and understand that her her father potentially did something awful to make a little bit of money gets very angry and he begins going on a rant saying that is not what happened actually kim kardashian and i decided to release a sex tape so that she would get publicity and so that it would help her become famous wow that is a shocking allegation right this is again a woman who is put into our faces every single day with the mainstream media we view her as a victim okay yeah she got fame in a weird way but okay who could hold that against her and he is now claiming that she was involved so this week her mother who is kris jenner you might be familiar with she manages all of the careers of her daughters went on to a late night talk show with james corden and she decided to take a public lie detector test to determine whether or not it was true that she and her daughter sat down with honchos and released the sex tape so that her daughter could become famous here is the clip here we go okay did you help kim release her sex tape it's okay no no true of course it's true thank you of course of course it's true of course it's true this is not a publicity stunt at all this is it i don't want you to think that kris jenner called up her pr agents who are so powerful and basically said we need to get in front of this narrative that we release the tape don't know of course it's true this is obviously a lie attacker test on a late night talk show so of course it's true except it's not so her doing this this obvious almost a stand-up routine it's a mockery it's insults it should insult your intelligence to believe that she actually took a lie detector test and determined the results live so ray j hears about this he watches this and he becomes infuriated and he goes on instagram and decides to expose the kardashian family for being one of the most dishonest families in media i would actually say the most dishonest family in media here is ray j taking the instagram you got 400 000 just like i got 400 000 we signed the contract the same day you got the same contract i got except guess what you rushed me to sign the contract because your mama was rushing me to sign it so guess what you did you signed my deliverables and your in your handwriting right because she was rushing me so you signed my deliverables kim kardashian got her hand right in her fingerprints all over my contract when you look at the two when you look at my signature and you look at her signature on my deliverables sex tape number one sex tape number two and guess what the third sex tape or the second they've been trying to play me on santa barbara sex her mama made us go shoot it for safety she watched the mother said hey we're gonna go with the first one because the first one is better it gives my daughter a better look than the second one that i made y'all go do but you watched it and made a decision and then you get on whatever show you was on and take a lie detector test with a fraud i i mean all i all i can say to that is wow wow indisputable by the way he's also dropped the handwriting of kim kardashian the three i'm holding it up right now the three sex tapes that her and her mother and him decided to choose between her mother was so involved did you hear him she was so involved in the details she wanted to pick which sex tape to release and then she went to her friends and she sat down with the honchos and she sold her daughter's body for fame ray j explains and you can go and you can find these clips online that this is why they did it it was the trend release a sex tape and you will get some fame you know i suppose it started with pamela and tommy paris hilton did something similar and kim kardashian and ray j decided that this would be a good thing to bolster her career and she went for it there are really no words that can adequately describe how positively disgusted i am by the story and what this signifies for the in terms of the world that we are in today what this really means that a mother sat down and decided to sell her daughter's body for fame and money and she was successful right but there are two two things here that we need to remember not only did she do it not only should we be completely disgusted by the idea that a mother i just had a daughter that a mother would sit down and watch various tapes of her daughter having sex with a boyfriend out of wedlock and then say let's sell this tape this is the best one you look the best in this tape this will make you the most famous not only is that disgusting but then that her plan worked kim kardashian is a billionaire today and she's by the way still selling sex i i now hold the opinion that kim kardashian is a prostitute and i'm not going to edit this opinion kim kardashian is a prostitute her mother is a pimp worse than a prostitute kim kardashian is a corpse she's a body without a soul she is so emblematic of the society that we live in today that if you are willing to degrade yourself if you are willing to denigrate yourself then our society our american society will give you more right how much are you willing to show us of your body how much are you willing to give us of your daughter's body that is the price of fame and she did it so no it is not an exaggeration to say uh that hollywood is satanic because what could possibly be more satanic than that what could possibly represent a more incestuous if you will relationship than a mother viewing her daughter's body having sex and selling it this is where we're at this is why we tell you not to follow the hollywood type this is why you should not allow your children to idolize hollywood this is why you should skip the emmys and you should skip the grammys and you should skip every other show because the people that are receiving these statues this form of idolatry i will do anything for this statue i will do anything for fame i will abort my child i will sell my child you tell me what i have to do these are not the people that we should be following thanks for joining me on this episode of candace owens if you like this video subscribe to the youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new videos to watch

you watched pornography probably listening thinking candace that's a wow why would you where are we going with this right it immediately kind of makes you feel a little icky even thinking about it or that i've even brought up this topic and i'm going to tell you why i'm asking so i had a conversation with my husband most of you guys know by now that i lived in a mixed faith household i'm protestant my husband is catholic and i have been reading a lot of catholic faith books to better understand his faith and as you may or may not know if you don't about to tell you pornography is banned in the catholic faith and so we started having this discussion about that topic in particular and my husband sort of remarked how desensitized we have all become to pornography as just one example my husband is not on social media people are always like i can't follow your husband i don't he doesn't have to see up twitter does he have instagram he has nothing and his reason is accurately that instagram is pornography he goes you open it and all you see are butt cheeks and boobs and women and i just don't think it's something that is conducive for a married man's lifestyle right it's pretty great but then he goes a little further and he says actually once you start to become conscious about it you will recognize that even the daily mail is pornography even us weekly magazine is pornography i mean you open a headline and you have a bunch of women that are half naked maybe they're a former bachelorette contestant and now for whatever reason she's half naked and she's got to put her butt cheeks on the internet so it's all around us and we've all become desensitized now why have we come desensitized well i can tell you that for me when i was in school and this was it would have been in the 2000s when we first started taking health courses i learned that watching pornography was healthy i learned that in school i didn't learn in the household i learned it from a teacher a male teacher who was our gym teacher who then transformed into our health teacher and he had these forms and it explained to us in class by actually partaking in pornography as in as a consumer of pornography is a good thing right this is the result of the sexual revolution right it's a good thing to consume porn and if you don't agree with that statement then there's something wrong with you you're backwards you might be a bible belt christian why don't you like pornography why don't you watch it it's a healthy thing for men and for women to do this sort of narcissistic task of locking ourselves in a room and being ashamed and embarrassed and watching something that is perverse so that you can satisfy yourself yourself now of course the answer to all this is that pornography is bad i'm not saying this because if you are listening to this and watching this and you go oh i do watch porn sometimes i'm not saying you're a horrible bad backwards person but i would hope that you could recognize that it is not a good thing to watch pornography why isn't a good thing because it allows you as i said to be an incredibly selfish person it corrodes relationships it makes it so that you are actually spending time it's this sort of virtual act of infidelity if you're a married person or you're in a relationship you're fantasizing about a different person so no pornography is not a good thing and beyond that are the realities of the pornographic industry for example i learned uh years ago which made me really have a strong opinion against pornography about how closely tied the child sex trafficking rings are to the pornography industry you know i learned that america we are the people that are setting the standard we are the biggest consumers of pornography so when you read these stories about children that are being trafficked from third world countries and you're going who who is watching this stuff these people that are taken and they grow up and they are put on the internet this is because americans are the biggest consumers we are the demands that's just something that you should know another thing that transformed my perspective on pornography um is that i sat down with a man that used to be in the porn industry he's now a pastor and he spoke about the alarming rates of suicide amongst female pornographic stars and of course that makes sense when you take a step back and you think about it obviously if you are a woman and you come from a background as they tend to be you have no money you have no access to things and you feel that the only thing you can sell is your body and you go down that route and maybe you make a little bit of money and then you think i don't want to do this anymore and i'm done telling my body because now i have a little bit of a cushion and i can go i can be something else well of course you come up against the wall right society says she used to be a porn star ew i'm not gonna hire this woman she's she's on the internet performing sex acts and so many of these women feel that they can't transform their lives and they commit suicide that's these are just things that you should know now why am i bringing this up today because as i said i started thinking about my early relationship with porn in terms of what i learned in school and just society as a whole how we sort of went from this cookie-cutter society in the 50s and then of course came hugh hefner and he sort of made pornography mainstream he didn't sort of he definitely did make pornography mainstream so it starts with the playboy bunnies right and it starts with something that is i guess you could say a form of soft core porn right women that are dressed up like bunnies hopping around and a man that's just sort of giving into this giving into his fantasies and this is the life that you can have right and then it gets to where we are today which is now in nanoseconds you can watch as much porn as possible and that porn is becoming increasingly perverse more and more perverse it's not enough now to advocate for heterosexual relationships between men and younger women that are dressed like bunnies people want to get into more kinky fantasies and so operating on a tip that i received from a catholic podcast that i was listening to it talked about this push amongst the pornography industry for incestuous relationships that now if you go onto a porno website like pornhub.com what they will offer to you what they will suggest to you if you will is that you watch and you consume pornography that is incestuous so i did that so that you didn't have to i logged on to pornhub.com and i just looked at the first page and i wrote down what the recommended video titles were so bear with me because it is so gross i'm going to have to just say expletive in certain uh and for certain titles okay so here's one title that is on this is again the main page of pornhub.com this morning today latina step mom f's her stepson to get him to stop masturbating here's another one fantasy horny step bro f's his stepsister hazel here's the third one milf caught cheating by husband with naughty stepdaughter here's a fourth one stepsisters julianne jensen and mindy mink and here is the top channel that is being recommended the title of the video is stepmom says i have a better place for your expletive does that concern you why on earth would the porn industry be pushing such deviancy why are they pushing incestuous relationships what is happening in our society so if that is the extreme version of porn and as i said the soft core version is what we are uh desensitized to today we are completely desensitized to what we see on our instagram pages we're eventually going to be desensitized obviously to the idea of incestuous relationship this is all a part of it which brings me to my cultural topic of today and again i know that sometimes people say candace why do you cover culture why do you cover it at all we should just stick to politics well i will remind you today and i will remind you tomorrow and i'll remind you every day that i can that politics is downstream from culture that is what andrew breitbart said and he is correct so culture is setting the tone for the eventuality of politics right culture decides that sex is okay and young people should have autonomy over their bodies and suddenly politically we will be arguing about whether children are able to pick their own gender and whether or not pedophilia is a bad thing which are actual arguments that are taking place today sadly so i want to talk about kim kardashian because this story just keeps getting darker and i actually can't believe the information um that has been exposed about her if you don't know who kim kardashian is bless you honestly i don't know how you could potentially not know who she is she is essentially um forced upon us by the mainstream media i feel as though every other article pertains to the kardashian sisters and i'm going to tell you how she arrived on the scene if you already know the story bear with me but i'm sure many of my listeners bless them do not kim kardashian had a boyfriend he was at that time he still is a rapper and an entertainer he goes by the name of ray j she was dating her boyfriend okay and they decided to record themselves having sex now this was a personal tape meant just for both of them and eventually this tape got leaked right so kim kardashian had a show that was coming out and eventually this tape got leaked and her and ray j had split up every implication on the show which tracked her finding out that this tape was going to come out uh indicated to the masses that her ex-boyfriend ray j leaked it and she was horrified by it she cried for years episode after episode about how this could possibly be happening to her and if you were watching this show as i was when i was younger you were sympathetic to her you actually thought to yourself this is horrible situation i mean she has a right to have sex with her boyfriend and nobody would want to know that something that was personal to you was then released for to to the public and now people are watching her so you felt sympathetic to her right well recently and now this is some 20 years later i believe 20 years later ray j is watching an episode of her new show and she again reintroduces the narrative of her as a victim of the sex tape that got released and ray j who is now much older and has a daughter who was able to watch this show and understand that her her father potentially did something awful to make a little bit of money gets very angry and he begins going on a rant saying that is not what happened actually kim kardashian and i decided to release a sex tape so that she would get publicity and so that it would help her become famous wow that is a shocking allegation right this is again a woman who is put into our faces every single day by the mainstream media we view her as a victim okay yeah she got fame in a weird way but okay who could hold that against her and he is now claiming that she was involved so this week her mother who is kris jenner you might be familiar with she manages all of the careers of her daughters went on to a late night talk show with james corden and she decided to take a public lie detector test to determine whether or not it was true that she and her daughter sat down with honchos and released the sex so that her daughter could become famous here is the clip here we go okay did you help kim release her sex tape it's okay no no true of course it's true thank you of course it's true of course it's true of course it's true this is not a publicity stunt at all this is it i don't want you to think that kris jenner called up her pr agents who are so powerful and basically said we need to get in front of this narrative that we release the tape don't know of course it's true this is obviously a lie attacker test on a late night talk show so of course it's true except it's not so her doing this this obvious almost a stand-up routine it's a it's a mockery it's insults it should insult your intelligence to believe that she actually took a lie detector test and determined the results live so ray j hears about this he watches this and he becomes infuriated and he goes on instagram and decides to expose the kardashian family for being one of the most dishonest families in media i would actually say the most dishonest family in media here is ray j taking to instagram you got 400 000 just like i got 400 000 we signed the contract the same day you got the same contract i got except guess what you rushed me to sign the contract because your mama was rushing me to sign it so guess what you did you signed my deliverables and your in your handwriting right because she was rushing me so you signed my deliverables kim kardashian got her hand right into her fingerprints all over my contract when you look at the two when you look at my signature and you look at her signature on my deliverables sex tape number one sex tape number two and guess what the third sex tape or the second they've been trying to play me on santa barbara sex her mama made us go shoot it for safety she watched the mother said hey we're gonna go with the first one because the first one is better it gives my daughter a better look than the second one that i made y'all go do but you watched it and made a decision and then you get on to whatever show you was on and take a lie detector test with a fraud i i mean all right all i can say to that is wow wow indisputable by the way he's also dropped the handwriting of kim kardashian the three i'm holding it up right now the three sex tapes that her and her mother and him decided to choose between her mother was so involved did you hear him she was so involved in the details she wanted to pick which sex tape to release and then she went to her friends and she sat down with the honchos and she sold her daughter's body for fame rayjay explains and you can go and you can find these clips online that this is why they did it it was the trend release a sex tape and you will get some fame you know i suppose it started with pamela and tommy paris hilton did something similar and kim kardashian and ray j decided that this would be a good thing to bolster her career and she went for it there are really no words that can adequately describe how positively disgusted i am by the story and what this signifies for the in terms of the world that we are in today what this really means that a mother sat down and decided to sell her daughter's body for fame and money and she was successful right but there are two two things here that we need to remember not only did she do it not only should we be completely disgusted by the idea that a mother i just had a daughter that a mother would sit down and watch various tapes of her daughter having sex with a boyfriend out of wedlock and then say let's sell this tape this is the best one you look the best in this tape this will make you the most famous not only is that disgusting but then that her plan worked kim kardashian is a billionaire today and she's by the way still selling sex i i now hold the opinion that kim kardashian is a prostitute and i'm not going to edit this opinion kim kardashian is a prostitute her mother is a pimp worse than a prostitute kim kardashian is a corpse she's a body without a soul she is so emblematic of the society that we live in today that if you are willing to degrade yourself if you are willing to denigrate yourself then our society our american society will give you more right how much are you willing to show us of your body how much are you willing to give us of your daughter's body that is the price of fame and she did it so no it is not an exaggeration to say uh that hollywood is satanic because what could possibly be more satanic than that what could possibly represent a more incestuous if you will relationship than a mother viewing her daughter's body having sex and selling it this is where we're at this is why we tell you not to follow the hollywood type this is why you should not allow your children to idolize hollywood this is why you should skip the emmys and you should skip the grammys and you should skip every other show because the people that are receiving these statues this form of idolatry i will do anything for this statue i will do anything for fame i will abort my child i will sell my child you tell me what i have to do these are not the people that we should be following i want to wrap this by giving you guys some more statistics that i think are just staggering about the pornography industry and we are going to continue this discussion more and more by the way because it never goes away everything around you is porn pornhub has 42 billion visits a year and 115 million visits every day six million videos are added each year onto that website alone uh one story a 15 year old missing girl was found seven months later after 58 videos of her rape were posted on pornhub so that goes back to me explaining to you that we are the market we are the demand and it is the reason that children are being snatched off of the streets another 14 year old girl who was kidnapped at knifepoint she was raped and assaulted for 12 hours and she begged pornhub for months months to remove the videos and had to threaten legal action before they were removed so think about how horrific that is you don't even know if what you are looking at is a consensual relationship between adults 25 of young adults surveys said that they watched porn as their primary source of sex education of course it goes back to me saying that this is what is destroying having healthy relationships because children are not just consuming porn as their primary source of sex education young adults part of me but they are then unable to have productive relationships because of this consumption as another statistic 88 of scenes in porn films contain acts of physical aggression and 49 of scenes contain verbal aggression it is projected that virtual reality vr porn should be a one billion dollar business by the year 2025 by the way guys that is where we're going i have friends who are explaining to me that that is the new thing that people are putting on those vr glasses just imagine how weird this is and they're perceiving this as reality that they are standing in front of a naked woman or a naked man and that is what they are doing uh to fulfill themselves i suppose this is sexual deviancy this is not about health far from what i was told in my health class in the early 2000s this is not about health this is a total and utter perversion of healthy relationships all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus i'm going to tell you all about how i actually reached out to ray j and i got a response plus i'm going to share my thoughts on the new little mermaid movie whether or not i've ever experienced sexism and how i dealt with it so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] you", "7D-58bhhhtc": "let's get to some light-hearted stuff though there are two topics i really want to cover i guess we'll start with madonna because this is a weird hill to try to die on right like i mean like madonna i don't know how old she is i think she's 60 something right is that like accuracy yeah yeah maybe 63. why'd you know that soft top of your hair i just know i know madonna are you a fan okay you go to a couple of madonna cos it's totally fine i heard like trees like she was big in the 80s i totally get it but she has been posting a lot of sexual images on instagram i guess she's going through a phase she's getting a lot of work done and she's putting herself in these positions um they're very sexualized and um she had one of these images of her on the bed there's one where she's under where she's under the bed which is actually really fun i don't know what this is like i just hope that 63 i'm not doing this that's all i'm going to say yeah anyways instagram took down this post where she was actually showing um her nipple and she was really angry about it and she reposted the image and she's like a man's nipple is not erotic why is mine being taken down and she's basically even correlated this to thanksgiving somehow maybe because of the time that she posted um she said perfectly timed the lies we have been raised to believe about the pilgrims peacefully breaking bread with the native american indians when they landed on plymouth rock god bless america artists are here to disturb the peace seems like a weird hillary dion i don't think it's anything to do with thanksgiving but she made it about thanksgiving what was your take on this situation i mean i think it's funny because i to my understanding something like this like people would have to mass report it so i think her fans were probably like maybe a little bit too much madonna yeah actually remove it because usually i mean i've seen way worse on instagram unfortunately and i haven't asked you but you know it pops up on your feed sometimes i'm not sure if i'm more concerned of the new variant or her nipple but um but no but in all honesty i think this is an indictment on our culture these our children look up to these people these are icons she should be in retirement spending time with her grandchildren she shouldn't be posting pictures like this on instagram to get attention she she hasn't been relevant and i think she's trying to be relevant here's my thing why was britney spears in a conservatorship and madonna is not nico like are you trying to understand like what are the rules here for a conservatorship you know what i mean and here i have to say this like you know i did work for madonna for a little bit this little unknown fact about me and like she's not the most sane person like she really is not the most same person she's a very unhappy person 100 agree that this is like just i need to get attention i need to be seen and i think that it's just one of those things where you know one of my producers said oh she's kind of right about this there's double standards on instagram and i'm just like but like anybody who's been in this free the nipple campaign it's like we do have a few things going on in the world if your biggest concern is whether or not you can put your nipples on the internet like you know what i mean first world problems you're privileged you're completely privileged you need to keep your mouth shut you know what i mean people are losing their businesses and pandemic trying to figure out how to survive and she's like i just need to put my nipple on the internet without having to take it down it's just it's just disgusting we will continue with the show in just one second but first we need to discuss protecting your retirement i'm getting sick of the news every day the left is trying to make another money grab whether it's looking at your accounts or taxing your unrealized gains there's no shortage to their creativity when it comes to taking your earned money to fund their expensive radical agenda i've been telling you for a while now you are making a mistake if you are not diversifying your savings start taking control of your savings by holding gold in a tax sheltered account

to claim your eligibility for their free gold with purchase offer by december 23rd text candace to 484848 and protect your savings today and then my second favorite culture story of the week speaking of spoiled celebrities lebron james oh my gosh lebron james getting two of the fans ejected from courtside seats in indiana it's just an amazing story i don't know if you saw if we have the video of the fans walking out but basically he said he wanted them gone the referees he said i want these two people gone you got these two fans when they when they were leaving they were doing the cry face of like crybaby brawn and which was which was trending on twitter for a little bit and people were trying to say the fans said horrible things you know it wasn't anything racial because lebron james would have been the first person in front of cameras calling them racist but um what was your take on this response by him i mean look if you're an athlete and you're getting paid millions of dollars why do you care about a fan in the crowd it's like why does that affect you so much you know i think that's priorities but of course it's lebron and he's been known to i also don't understand how if you're an athlete that gets paid to be on that court playing basketball why do you get the option opportunity just tell people that are in the crowd that they have to leave even if you disagree with what they're saying about you criticizing you that's that's part of being in and the nba right right it's it's he's such a little princess and i think that the reason why this story really speaks to me it's just it just speaks to where our culture is right now you could never ever ever envision michael jordan doing this right like so times have really changed everyone's just such a princess with so many feelings they think that their feelings matter stop the game maybe they said some mean stuff i saw some people say oh they said that he hopes he dies of covet or something oh go through my instagram post see what people say about me i hate males like like people made like actual racial comments to you and about like yeah the whole time it's like when you decide that you're going to be a public figure and by the way i'm not getting paid lebron money right you're a public figure you get paid an insane amount of money you're building a 100 million dollar mansion in bel air like toughen up lebron get some things i'll take some mean tweets and meet comments for 100 million i promise you right you can say whatever you want for a cool 100 million dollars i probably never he's a bit of a cry with my hundreds yeah anyways you know like i always say guys to wrap that up bring back manly men thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this

regarding Emma rodrigowski she came out in defense of the woman if you're following the story of Adam Levine having cheated on his Victoria's Secret model wife the Behati Prinsloo a lot of people including myself talked about that woman who he was texting because she wanted to absolve herself from his Instagram DMS and said she felt manipulated and yes she had engaged in this one-year dalliance with Adam Levine but she was just a young girl and we all rightfully said that excuse no longer cuts it you knew he was a married man that doesn't excuse him oh it doesn't excuse him of course he partooking this and he is the one that took the vows to Bahari Prinsloo but we need to stop excusing the women of course Emily rojakowski whose husband has recently cheated on her and she does not at all think she has played a role in this she does not see her acts on Instagram to be an active infidelity had something to say about that take and of course she is going to defend the woman involved in this affair in this take a listen problem in our culture right now is that we just say oh men are monsters they're terrible they're horrible we don't hold them accountable and then we blame other women we ask women to adjust their behavior instead of just saying men need to change their behavior it's sexism it's classic misogyny period it's actually none of those things Emily but I don't expect you to know what any of those words mean um actually it's not classic misogyny to expect that women act respectable towards other women that are in married relationships it's not classic sexism to say that it takes two to tango that's that's actually equality if you want to get down to it to look at the party that has involved both parties the man and the woman and say both of you hold responsibility here that's equality I know that women are getting so used to special benefits in the post metoo and time's up world that equality feels like discrimination but it isn't we're not discriminating against this woman she knew what she was doing she knew who Adam Levine was right she knew exactly what she was doing when she answered his direct messages she knew he was a married man just like he knew he was a married man they are both wrong and the the sweet irony of her we need to just blame the men it's no if you actually Lee had an equitable brain Emma rajkowski you would see how your own behavior in your marriage was an act of infidelity as I said in previous episode I feel like I have slept with Emma rajkowski every time I open an article about her her boobs are in my face every time you open Instagram and they suggest posts to you her boobs are in your face and you know you don't even know why by the way the most bizarre headline of this week was actually uh I think it was in The Daily Mail they were reporting and they said it said Emily rajakowski promotes bikini topless what I don't even understand that what do you mean she's she's selling a bikini topless how are you don't you physically have to wear the Garment somehow she's just like I'm taking my boobs are out again so buy the bikini that's not on me I mean this is this is weird and as I said represents a tremendous Act of infidelity to her marriage and so she got what she gave and she was given exactly what her behavior is someone who is not in a committed relationship another person who I loved to consider uh when talking about this topic of these strange avatars that we have created is Madonna who has become so strange uh it's almost like we are watching somebody facing a real mental crisis which is what Instagram really has become various women acting out their mental crises here are some photos of her she's wearing fishnet tights you post this to her personal Instagram she has her boob out she is in leather and she is biting what looks to be a leather oh the end of her end of her metal bed and she's wearing just to be extra controversial she's wearing a cross around her neck and yeah fishnets and heels half naked actually more than half naked and this is meant to be seductive and she has her buttocks out through the fishnets and she's bending over on top of a pillow and I look at this and I say would you do this she's under the bed in this one photo she's under the bed with her butt in the air and fishnets she's 63 years old I believe I look at these photos and I ask myself would you do this in real life Madonna I mean just imagine if you're a person and you're going to buy a mattress right you're just going through a store you're like I need a better mattress and you see a 63 year old woman right and she's in fishnets and she's on top of the bed and she's moving her hips and she's gyrating into sexy poses getting on top of this mattress then she gets under it and she's fully oh she's almost naked right and she puts her butt into the air and you can see her thong through it and then you see that she's wearing a leather corset with her boobs pushed out you would say this is completely crazy somebody please call a police officer to assist this woman she's obviously having a breakdown you would expect and not be surprised if she got taken away in an ambulance and put on a psych 5150 hole because clearly she's having some sort of a breakdown right yeah in the real world but not in the strange Avatar world that we've created where 63 year old women doing this is normal is okay is in some cases according to the comments Brave slay Bay oh we love you it's provocative yeah it is provocative it's provoking me to think that you have a mental disorder and it needs to be addressed all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Johnny Depp's new

you guys to a happier story and by happier I mean sadder that's what I meant by happier when it's funny at least it's funny in a sad way but I'm sure you guys been following the Brittany grinder story she's a WNBA player and she got caught with cannabis cartridges going into Russia that's a big No-No it's Russia and she was sent into prison there and obviously this caused an uproar because how could a WNBA player who just wanted to smoke a little pot be sent into a sweat shop in Russia and by the way I have been vocal I thought the punishment was extreme for the crime right I'm not one of these people that's like oh no walk away every single person that has a cartridge of marijuana on them I think what she did was stupid and she's anti-American and she's constantly commenting on America but at the same time I think that this sentence was also extreme so I'm in the middle of this she's now been released in a prisoner swap which is just the most ridiculous I've ever heard they swapped Brittany Greiner for a merchant of death arms dealer Victor Bell a Russian Merchant of death that's what he's called arms dealer so I'm just trying to picture Putin getting this phone call because it's just so rude ring ring ring uh Mr Putin America is on the line and they are very sad that you're keeping Britney keeping her just ridiculously smoking pot this is a very bad Russian accent but let's go with this right um okay America's on the phone again and and they're very very sad they say they're super sad that you have her what are you calling me about the emotions of the Americans I don't care about the emotions of the Americans okay well uh the activists in America say they're super deduper sad and they're wanting to know if they gave you your arms dealer who is referred to as The Merchant of death would you give them back their pot smoking WNBA player is this a prank no no it's it's just Western philosophy it's just America so they want to feel good they want to feel good so if you can just please give them their openly lesbian pot smoking basketball player they will give you back immersion of death because I don't know it's America and it's 2022 and so this makes sense in 2022 where everything is rainbows and sprinkles and it's all about how we feel not the practicality of what's taking place which is that nowhere ever in the history of the world would any sane individual say it's a good idea to swap somebody that is entitled The Merchant of death and is an arms dealer for a possible WNBA player two things can be true at once her sentence was harsh but also if we're gonna get her back it shouldn't come at this cost right that's the answer here and just in case you didn't realize how patently ridiculous the Toddlers and Tiaras that are running our nation are Joe Biden who can barely speak at this point gate had these words to share about Brittany greiner's release Brittany is uh is an incomparable athlete okay let's stop right there I'm I'm sorry did you say Brittany is an incomparable athlete who wrote this what are we talking it's the WNBA there's such thing as an incomparable athlete in the wnbh WNBA so for all three of my listeners who watched the WNBA literally I'm going to have to assume that there are some athletes that we can in fact compare to Brittany Greiner all of them probably can be compared to Brittany Griner because probably a high school male basketball team could defeat the WNBA I don't be meant to be insulting it's just a ridiculous statement to say that she is incomparable as an athlete but go ahead Biden let's see if you can stick in some more Ridiculousness Brittany is uh is an incomparable athlete a two-time Olympic gold medalist for Team USA she endured mistreatment and I showed at a show trial in Russia with characteristic grit and incredible dignity she represents the best America and best about America it is across the board everything about her she represents the best that America the best of America across the board this is the pretty grinder this is it this is the best this is americanism right here when I think of America when I salute the flag when I pledge allegiance to the flag would I wear red white and blue on the 4th of July and I am thinking about all of the ways in which I love my country Brittany Greiner is the first thing that comes I don't know about you guys I don't know about you guys but that's I'm like oh thank you for the brave people that have fought for our country's freedoms because it allows us to have pot smoking WNBA players this is really the best that America has to offer it really is and that is an extremely depressing narrative about the state of things today but it's an honest narrative I really do believe that the left sees this as they win that they care so much about how they feel on the inside that they would be willing to put our country at danger they would trade anybody to to protect a lesbian pot smoking basketball player that hates America like that's exactly what life's all about and unfortunately what this really represents is the decline of the West that's the truth the West is declining we are in a steep decline right now because we have leaders that can look you in the eye and tell you that people like Brittany Greiner are the best that they have to offer so yes Putin is laughing because you should be laughing it's just most ridiculous trading ever in the history of the world it's like trading LeBron James for Danny DeVito I like Danny DeVito I like Danny DeVito's movies but I don't think that the Lakers should take them to play basketball because it's a ridiculous trade because it doesn't even he doesn't even play basketball in the realm of politics Brittany Greiner being swapped for an arms dealer makes entirely no sense he makes the kind of no sense like swapping LeBron James for Danny DeVito for a basketball team would make it would be like swapping Pokemon cards and someone's like hey I've got Pikachu and then you come back at them and you're like okay I have Arthur the aardvark what but this that's not even a Pokemon we even say it doesn't matter because it's a trade it's the worst trade possibly ever ladies and gentlemen somehow time is already up which means the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so I will be diving into

thank you", "gL1JWgpyL9E": "okay i was not expecting to do a live today i really wasn't supposed to be having a nice day i'm in the uk it's too early to do a live if you're in america but i'm so fired up right now i'm so angry and genuinely if you're watching this live i want you to find someone who hates me i want you to find someone who thinks i don't believe in candace owens i think she's a liar i don't trust her anything she says i want you to find that person because this is such a good example for them to potentially awaken themselves to the truth which is that we are all living in a society in which journalists lie they create division they decide who they want to be the heroes and who they want to be the villains and they una potted unapologetically lie about what actually took place because they hate someone and they actually lie the most viciously whenever you see the journalist taking off about a story and they're going absolutely nuts and it's a political story you can almost guarantee yourself that they're lying to cover the truth right i can't even actually believe this story so i'm gonna i want you guys to look it up i want you to watch it live because this is such a learning exercise because i don't care how much you think you hate candace owens you you cannot just completely put yourself into the dark and remain this ignorant there is a global awakening happening in this moment okay the entire world right now is awakening to the fact that a very small population of the world actually controls everything the first thing that they control is the media the media lies they work for the states these states meaning like there's a globalist agenda so clearly the journalists lie they work for them they're they're bankrolled by these people their job is to lie and to delude you about the truth they don't want you to know what's going on they don't want you to know how tyrannical they are i don't want you to know that they constantly want you in a state of fear i spoke about this the other day i spoke at two churches last week and i was saying that fear is the mechanism by which evil can control you right so if you are constantly in fear and they're constantly making you feel fearful it's because it's low energy it's a low energy vibe and they know that once you're fearful they can control you like we saw that it's exercising coping all they wanted was people to be completely in a state of fear paralyzed by fear so that they couldn't do anything but pray to the government to the government for deliverance right and that's what happened we see people that are still living a copic 19 psychosis that is inexplicable but forget all that because i want to tell you the story so you can understand what i'm talking about obviously you guys know that i have a show i'm a daily wire very proud of it candace i write the entire show every every piece of me goes into the show because i just want people to know what's going on all around the world and i write my own monologues and i get interested in various topics and last week i wanted to do an entire episode dedicated to australia because my my husband has family in australia and we do not have the same political beliefs and they essentially sent us a very long text message talking about what is happening in australia if you do not know what is happening in australia you need to look it up actually you need to watch my monologue i'm going to share the monologue after this i might post it on my main instagram page i'll definitely at least post a link to it so you can watch it on a daily wire show or watch it on youtube and i basically just talked about verbatim read her text messages about what is going on australia like these people are not allowed to leave their state so imagine america if you live in connecticut and you're not allowed to travel to new jersey without applying for permission to travel to new jersey from the states imagine if you're live in connecticut and your cousin dies in new jersey you're not allowed to go to your cousin's funeral because you have to apply for permission from the state imagine if your family member died and you're not allowed to have more than five to ten people at the funeral unless period right and you're not even allowed to host that funeral unless you apply for permission from the state there are people that are locked outside again australia locked outside of their own states because they're not allowed to go back into their homes unless they get the vaccine it is a complete and utter police state it's completely tyrannical it's totalitarian and i wanted to make sure americans were aware of it because what happens in australia can happen here do not think that we are special i hope you realize that we are not special after everything happened during covet the only thing that really makes us unique is that we have state powers and so despite the biden administration trying so hard to implement what's happening in australia here we have this little thing called the constitution which is getting in their way right we have this little thing which allows the states to actually say you know what we're not actually going to be doing that thank god for desantis thank god for texas and governor abbott which are finally standing up to this administration more states as well by the way south dakota you know and saying we are not going to be enforcing these radical policies here but if we did not have that little thing called the constitution we would be literally living on people in australia okay so i dedicate a monologue to making sure americans are aware of what is happening in australia and i verbatim read exactly what they were telling me are the rules all true and i was particularly talking about what's happening in queensland and um at the end of monologue i said i'm going to share it so you're going to watch it it's going to be sort of out of context but i said you know when do we invade australia and then i said i say that of course in jest that was a joke besides a joke well i've been trending on twitter for the last 48 hours because the guardian has run a headline saying that candace owens suggests the u.s should invade australia completely strip did not even add the sentence i see that of course in jest remove from its entire context like actually if you hate me you need to watch this model i'm going to drop because it's very clear i'm talking because i actually say i say that of course in jest right but the guardian the monologue took off everyone is sharing it in australia it's it's going viral so they instantly said we need to lie because we don't want people to read we don't be able to watch this model we want people to read the article about the monologue we need to lie we need to get in front of the truth with a very big lie and it's going to sound radical to run the headline that candace suggests that we should invade australia and strip it of its meaningful context because we don't we know that people are not going to read they're not going to watch tomorrow they're just going to read the headline and the headline is going to say you know candace owens you know u.s far right pundit says that we should invade australia which is like it's just it is just i can't even say it's a thing that's beyond a sin it's it's something else that we're doing with here it's it's evil right it's a sin a sin is a bad thing right what the journalists are doing all around the world is an evil thing it is it is satanic it is evil it is we do not want people to be awake to the truth so all we need to do is make the lie bigger than the truth and the majority of people are really stupid this is their idea they're not smart enough to read anything beyond a headline this is their idea we make sure of that because we have polluted the education system we're brainwashing them in the school if you think that this is like what's happening in america is unique with the education it's not it's happened before history does nothing but repeat itself okay hitler youth stalin used the communist youth they want to make sure that the kids are raised up in a way that they will become puppets for the totalitarian regime you know that is running the state right they want to make sure up these kids become puppets for the states and that is happening right now in america probably not just america right where these kids are learning nothing they're becoming dumber and dumber and dumber and they don't focus anymore right we're in the age of social media yes i appreciate the irony i'm on social media but in the meaning that most kids cannot sit down and read a full book they can't right so they're obsessed with very quick headlines social media has taught them learn information very fast learn information very quick so they read a headline and it says canada's own suggests we should invade australia and they go well that must be true i can't believe how could you support canis owens she thinks that you should invade australia she is suggesting that we should buckle up and we should kill the australians how could you possibly support radical candace owens well of course the kids didn't even click through the articles by the headline they saw the trend on twitter they clicked the trend on twitter and they saw it and they now know who candace owens is because they couldn't be bothered to actually watch the monologue which is very hard-hitting so hard-hitting that the actually educated people right the people who actually are fearful of an awakening the powers that be per se right they said this is a very powerful monologue we need to make sure nobody pursues this monologue and so we need to get out in front of the monologue we need to tell a lie that it's bigger than the truth that exists in the monologue that is happening right now i am trending right now over something that i said of course i said it i said when do we invade australia i say that of course in jest but the just part saw there so right now you are going to have an exercise in what it takes for a lie to make its way around the world from america to australia before the truth gets up and puts its shoes on as my granddad used to say right a lie will make its way around the world so fast before people even appreciate even begin to fathom the truth and the truth is that i told the truth to the world about what's happening in australia because it freaking matters do not want to curse it matters it matters because it could happen here it could matter when i say here i'm not just referring to the united kingdom i'm referring also to america it can happen anywhere okay and you need to watch this monologue you need to see the truth before you allow the guardian who i am going to have my lawyers send a letter to because the guardian is actually based in the uk and the uk has very strong bible laws you can't just lie like that in the uk and i want a full retraction to pretend that i was not joking when i quite literally said i say that in jest is demonic it's satanic it is the reason that this world is so divided it is the reason why everywhere in the world people are being impoverished and imprisoned by their governments who have launched a war against their own people is an information war they're lying to you about what is happening everywhere they're lying to you about your own body right you don't even trust your own body anymore people are afraid when someone sneezes okay because the government has launched a war a propaganda war a psychological war against its own people because fear gives them more power that's the truth that is the truth fear gives them more power and i have been talking about this for weeks on my show i know most of you guys are subscribed to it that's why you follow me if you're not subscribed to it you need to subscribe to it and

"so I asked the question who is your queen I'm thinking about that because I've obviously like many of you been watching Queen Elizabeth's State funeral but also watching the mixed reaction to it I have to say I am pretty amazed I'm sure you two are following the backlash from the more woke crowd because everything is an opportunity to tell black people that they should be upset right they referred to Queen Elizabeth as a colonist a murderer okay I'm not really interested in defending those positions I easily could but I'm more interested in covering the stark contrast regarding the individuals who attacked her and their positions on previous things that have occurred within Black America ready so the first person obviously I'd like to talk about which you probably heard about because the timing of her tweet was just incredible it felt like moments after we learned that Queen Elizabeth had passed she felt it was necessary to send a vicious disgusting tweet this is a professor of course it's always a professor at Carnegie Mellon her name is uju Anya and she tweeted this I heard the chief monarch of A thieving raping genocidal Empire is finally dying May her pain be excruciating I want to focus on that word raping right because apparently you have to assume that rape bothers her but you shouldn't assume that because do you remember Jacob Blake do you remember the black man uh who police officers were attempting to apprehend his charges were as follows he essentially to give you the back story in case you don't remember it uh it was a woman that he was involved with a black woman who had called the police to the scene over a domestic dispute she had previously accused him of sexual assault and he was not supposed to be near her but he was back and confronting her and she called police to assist her obviously because he had a warrant out for his arrest for that previous sexual assault police said that he had a knife when they arrived and police told him to drop the knife he did not drop the knife and a knife was eventually recovered from that scene by the way I want to be more explicit here he was accused of digitally raping that woman who called the police to the scene she would think that ujuanya would have something to say about that and she did have something to say what she said was Jacob Blake is a family man she went on to say his sister latitra Woodman reminds us all that he has people and he is somebody's people no image you paint of him erases that no story you tell alleging his lack of worth justifies the crime police committed against him wow okay so she doesn't care that a woman called and obviously was scared for her life she doesn't care that a woman has accused him of sexual assault she doesn't care that a woman has accused him of digitally raping her because nothing that you could possibly say could denigrate Jacob Blake in her mind who cares if he was a knife-wielding maniac it doesn't matter because I don't know black Americans should see him as some sort of a brave hero I guess see him as a victim this happens over and over and over again I have to ask the question who are the people that we are told that we should feel badly for who are the people that we are told that we should celebrate who are our kings and queens not far behind of course was the Washington Post this is a tweet from columnist Karen attire regarding Queen Elizabeth's passing she wrote black and brown people around the world who were subject to horrendous cruelties and economic deprivation under British colonialism are allowed to have feelings about Queen Elizabeth after all they were her subjects too okay so the idea here is obvious black Americans have been subjected to horrendous cruelties under British colonialism got it Karen now what were her thoughts on George Floyd if you want to talk about Black Americans that suffer under the hands of somebody George Floyd would be an interesting uh topic to discuss the George Floyd death she tweeted this I will never forget that George Floyd called out for his late mother in the moments before he died and the whole world responded we got you big Floyd well first off fact check I should mention that regarding calling out for his mama his girlfriend who was white testified on the stand that she was mama that he called her mama affectionately and he had done so in previous arrests which you will see in my George Floyd documentary which is going to be dropping soon but Karen took it a step further Karen also tweeted George Floyd better get times person of the year Okay so just so I'm clear here Queen Elizabeth is a horrendously cruel person under which black people have suffered around the world but George Floyd better get times person of the year George Floyd how many arrests did he have was I think nine in total for various crimes a lot of drug charges obviously drugs have been a huge problem in Black America criminality remember when he knocked on a woman's door pretended to be from the water department he had a towering figure I think he was six seven six foot seven forced his way into an apartment put a gun to her abdomen and robbed the place yeah he better get timed person of the year this is constantly the message that is coming down the pipeline for Black America we need to celebrate criminals but when we talk about somebody with a life and a legacy of Queen Elizabeth well she's white so we better see ourselves and perceive ourselves as the victims nobody cares about how black American culture has been suffering nobody cares about the inner city communities that have been suffering under people like George Floyd right the criminality that is running rampant people that are getting arrested and released back onto the streets nobody cares nobody wants to talk about it in fact if you do talk about it you're a racist right that's it you're a racist if you talk about it and you're a black person okay they won't call you racist instead they will call you as they have called me a [\u00a0__\u00a0] and Uncle Tom a traitor to my race because I have the audacity to talk about the things that are harming us inadvertently sexual Community right we have been told that our value is somehow tied to our sexuality yeah let's make fun of people like Candace Jones who are talking about how songs like WAP are harming young black girls as they are coming up right harming it's it is harmful to hear music like that thoughts become things it's harmful to put that stuff onto TV and to have women glorifying that to have young girls going to this concert and saying this is a good thing so who is our Queen in Black America who is our King is our King George Floyd is that it because I don't remember any of these professors and journalists commenting on the fact that he got three funerals and was buried in a gold casket that was our state funeral so to speak but everyone was okay with that nobody cared about the horrific things that he did throughout his life because it wasn't politically expedient didn't create the narrative enough for them of white people bad black people always good nobody cares to comment on the state of things in Black America we worship who Beyonce is the queen right Beyonce Queen Beyonce Queen slay Bay and what's coming down to young women from her this is an example by the way as of Beyonce in a campaign Ivy Park Adidas Ivy Park is her brand Adidas has acquired it they're in some partnership I want you to actually take a look at this clip of her squatting down right opening her legs ajar and putting a finger into her mouth as she wears tight spandex here's my question why when someone bounces and opens their crotch does that make you want to buy the product more it's a serious question I'm sure Black America will watch this clip and say oh my God Candace you're so prude oh my God who cares she slayed the day that's Beyonce she's Bae she's Queen she's slated why is Beyonce not talented enough and beautiful enough to get us to buy her gym kit without having to be seductive without having to be overtly sexual I actually think that it's it denigrates her Talent she's a beautiful voice she's had a long career and yet this is the way that we have to sell stuff in Black America apparently this is what we view to be Queen this is the sorts of people that we think should have multiple funerals should they die right this is a problem think about even the Partnerships which I find to be strange when we have rappers that take on Partnerships with fast food companies for example Megan the stallion she has hot sauce at Popeyes we have ubereats which has offered Migos to have a themed Popeyes meal we have sweetie and Travis Scott who have Partnerships with McDonald's so fast food right when they think of going into Partnerships with black America it's fast food okay you can have chicken you can have Popeyes you can have hot sauce this is what you black people like right it's insulting I find all of it to be insulting and of course what people want you to do is to focus on anything but real black history right they don't want to talk to you about the state and governance the over governance that's happening in Black America when I get on a stage and I talk about the welfare system where I talk about how for Democrats Black America has provided a lab rat experiment experiment right they went back into the 1960s and they saw a black American culture that was together that is what happened in the 1960s black Americans were married black Americans had their families together black Americans believe it or not this is a fact in the 1950s under Jim Crow black Americans were out pacing white Americans in terms of economic growth because we had better values because we had a better culture and then they saw this Lyndon Baines Johnson who is an overtly racist president who sat in the White House said we have to fix that and how they fixed it was via the Great Society act they offered black Americans welfare benefits they said we're here to help we're the government we're here to help you but here's what you're gonna have to do to get those welfare benefits we'll give you more money if you don't marry the father of your children they sent people from the government around to inspect homes to make sure that black men were not living in them to make sure that they furthered the single motherhood rate and every other ill has followed obviously father absence is the main thing that is harming Black America it is something to be noted that in the 1960s a single motherhood rate was just 23 in Black America and during those times that was considered a crisis 23 percent of black children growing up without a father in the home today the single motherhood rate is something like 74 in Black America and so you ask the question why so many black men are locked up without asking the question is how many of them grew up with fathers in the home these things have a lot to do with one another but nobody wants to talk about that no no it doesn't matter it's just racism is the reason that they're in prison it's not because of a rotten culture it's not because of WAP it's not because of nudity it's not because of overt sexuality it's not because we are only seen as a community that can further things like fast food that's the partnership that's great you're a rapper hey I'm looking around a chicken sandwich none of that is racist none of that is harmful um no absolutely not the issue is Queen Elizabeth it's Queen Elizabeth and historical racism and that's what we should be upset about the issue is not the fact that we're getting arrested but the ways in which the police are dealing with us let's talk about police brutality instead of talking about why it is that we are having so many correspondences with police why it is that black Americans black American men specifically young black American men are over represented when it comes to murders in this country we're talking about something like six percent of the population that commits about 40 percent of all of the murders don't talk about that Candace we don't like the facts we do not like that it is harmful for you to Aspire to something better Candice to Believe In Black America is what's wrong with you so we're going to call you a race Trader because this apparently is the best that we have to offer and that's a shame all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on whether or not I think monogamy is natural so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "xFeWK9ooUPU": "we have PornHub a bunch of women sex workers over at PornHub are upset because if you did not hear this Instagram took off the PornHub account and they said that they were in violation of their rules repeatedly well these women have stood up and these sex workers men and women alike have stood up and they said wait a second Instagram tolerates racy pictures from celebrities like Kim Kardashian while they unfairly censor the porn industry the group accused Instagram in a letter on Tuesday of quote violent and profoundly damaging and quote harm to the porn industry by selectively enforcing its content moderation rules though Instagram insists that it was PornHub that is to blame because they were violated the rules repeatedly now I have to say this I actually am going to be for the first time team PornHub on this you probably heard me in last week's episodes um talking about the pornography industry and making people realize that porn is actually everywhere right we're just deciding as they as they said which standard of porn we're willing to accept yes Kim Kardashian posts nude photos all the time barely covering her nipples barely covering her private parts and somehow it's allowed to stand last week we also covered that strange photo the photos that Madonna posts on Instagram where she is basically naked she's in fishnet she's wearing a thong she's under a bed she has her full fake ass in the air because she got I decided at the age of 63 years old she decided that she needed to get butt implants and all that's allowed on Instagram it's allowed as long as you don't show the nipple you can put whatever pornography that you basically want Instagram so why come down on the sex workers who don't make as much money as the billionaire Kardashians who don't make as much money as Madonna why are we coming down there needs to either be a real standard right or there should be no double standards we just need to have a real standard to not allow pornography on the internet so I'm interested to see where that's going to go obviously we know where it's going to go Kim Kardashian will be protected Madonna will be protected and these sex workers will have to face consequences this next story is unbelievable it's one of my favorite categories of leftist insanity it's cultural appropriation where people get offended for everything you can just log on to the internet and you can see a girl braiding her hair and then you can go cultural appropriation you did not give credit to some tribe in Africa that invented the braid I don't know what tribe that was but people get upset from hairstyles nowadays honestly they'll say you stole that from Jamaican culture you stole that from African culture you stole that from insert whatever culture and unless you properly accredit whatever you do you can be in trouble if you're white by the way I can do whatever I want it's great I love being black but if you're white you are not allowed to do that which is why Haley Bieber that is Justin Bieber's wife she is a model got in some into into very real trouble for using a ready a certain shade of lipstick she got in so much trouble that Good Morning America did a full segment on the cultural appropriation of her lipstick shade take a listen now we're going to go to our GMA cover story Haley Bieber facing backlash the supermodel getting heat after sharing a makeup look on Tick Tock with some users causing the look cultural appropriation Jeffrey Ramos had the details good morning Stephanie Michael good morning Haley Bieber doesn't claim to have invented this particular lip combo in her video the brown lip liner and the clear lip gloss but that post about that combo led to an influx of tick tock users recreating the look on the platform and crediting Bieber as their inspiration others calling it cultural appropriation this morning supermodel Haley Bieber facing backlash after sharing her new lip routine on Tick Tock with the caption ready for all the fall things including brownie glazed lips [Music] the now viral post causing a wave of criticism social media users calling out the supermodel claiming she is culturally appropriating the makeup routine using dark lip liner and clear lip gloss a popular style from the late 80s and 90s I know that that lip combo is not Haley Bieber lips it is a Latina and black woman live combo the issue is when something is sort of presented as if it's something new when it's a practice that has been around for decades and decades African-American and Latino women get denigrated for the ways that they present their body the way they weigh their hair people use words like ghetto or ratchet or that have these identities to denigrate women it was ghetto it was trashy it was not cute many pointing out that the lip style was accepted when a white woman did it but not when a woman of color did because if that would be me in high school here in the Midwest I would have gotten so much shame for that I just want to know what high school she went to that she would have gotten so much shame for that and by the way I love that during this segment they say this is a trend from the late 80s yeah Haley Bieber wasn't alive she is so young that she was not alive in the late 80s and the early 90s I mean just could you imagine just putting on lipstick and causing so much backlash that you actually warrant an entire segment on Good Morning America over something that ridiculous as putting the color brown on your lips with some lip gloss by the way I used to have this girlfriend of mine she was Irish she was obviously white blonde hair hazel eyes best friends growing up and we used to go to Claire's and go to CVS this is the land before Tick Tock and Instagram and Facebook right so we were allowed to just I don't know put Brown lip liner on with lip gloss and be dropped off at middle school and nope we didn't get any shame nope we were just kids trying on weird trends that we made up all by ourselves little did we know that had we have done that during the time of peak stupidity in America that we would have been in a lot of trouble that we would have gotten shame black Americans being shamed my mother wears these I don't know what anybody is talking about I've never ever ever thought that I had to attribute something to anything other than it looked good but of course as we know today women in America are oppressed and we know the reasons why tell us again Emily tell us again it's sexism it's classic misogyny it is I find everything that Haley Bieber did to be a classic um misogyny moving on you guys I have breaking news from my orthodontist if you guys didn't know I actually got you might be able to hear it a little bit when I speak I got a full set of braces on my bottom row to correct a tooth now you're probably thinking Candace why are you telling us this that's quite personal we don't need to know what's going on in your mouth well I have to tell you because somebody else already told you yeah a young woman that had to suffer sharing space with me in the waiting room at the orthodontist went on to tick tock to tell a story about how she saw Candace Owens at the orthodontist and this video has racked up almost 1.5 million views she did a little series on Tick Tock which you can take a look at I will read you the captions if you are listening it says not Candace Owens sitting right next to me at the orthodontist gonna pretend that I'm a fan and ask for a pick and then she posts a picture of us together because she did come up to me but because 1.4 million people were just so amazed that she pretended to be a fan and get a picture they asked her to further explicate the incident because again this is breaking news Candace Owens goes to the orthodontist and here is a video of her detailing her harrowing encounter so I've been getting a lot of questions about what exactly happened and what did I say to her but there really isn't much of a story um I was leaving the orthodontist after getting my Invisalign buttons off and I saw her sitting across as I was like getting my Uber and I like did a double take I was like there's no way that's Candace Owen I did a double take she was sitting next to this white woman who I'm pretty sure is her like assistant or whatever and so like I did a double take and then I like ran out of the room and I called my sister and I was like Gabby you're not gonna believe who's right who was right there it was Candice oh and she was like there's no way there's no way she's like I don't know and I was like oh my gosh that's crazy she's like you should take a picture with her and I was like what she's like you should pretend to be a fan and take a picture with her and I was like I don't think I could do that girl but she dared me to so I did to her I wasn't sure if I like wanted to fix my hair keep my glasses on because these are kind of giving like liberal like come on but I kept my glasses on and then I went up to her and then I looked at her again and I think I gave her an RBF but I didn't mean to and yeah I said oh hi are you Candace Owens and she like looked up and smiled she's like I am and then I said like oh my gosh I'm a huge fan of your work or no I said I really admire your work and she was like oh you do really thank you and I said do you mind if we could take a picture together and she said yes and I shook her hand and I introduced myself I was like hi I'm Tony and we took a picture and her little white assistant was like cheese in I was like okay girl let's let's chill but like overall she was really nice she was really pretty um very very pretty like in real life like she was like she was eaten at the orthodontist like come on but I didn't want to post that video because um I didn't want her to see it because I knew if I posted it it would get attention and it did um because to be honest like you know she's an actual human being and like I don't condone on the internet but I thought it would be funny so I did also for everyone complimenting my teeth thank you just got five visit line all thank you thank you okay that's all I gotta say yeah that's um breaking news in today's world you guys Candace Owens is a human being I was I was shocked I was shocked when this video made explain to me I can't believe it I can't believe Candace Owens is a human being I also can't believe that she was able to stretch a correspondence that took about three seconds in to a two minute video that has garnered millions of views I just that's actually the most important point that I want you to take away that our society has become so remarkably privileged that millions of people have nothing else better to do than to watch this Encounter of me sitting in the orthodontist waiting room being a kind individual and taking a picture also I don't appreciate the shade that's thrown at my assistant okay imagine if my assistant got onto Tick Tock and was like this black girl was cheesing over there this black girl I don't know some little black girl was over there that would never be allowed but who cares 2022 and it's all now breaking news to see Candace Owens getting her braces tightened all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Rachel dollazole's only fans account guys yes I love that so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "stU9kwyqOP8": "let's talk about the cdc the cdc um has estimated that the number of patients that are going to need anticoagulants is expected to double by 2050 so anticoagulants that's regarding blood clotting that's a medical term for blood clots per the cdc website deep vein thrombosis which is a blood clot located in the deep vein is usually in a leg or an arm or pulmonary embolism which is a blood clot that has traveled from a deep vein to a lung yeah they're just expecting that all to double by 2050 why why i'll ask a question and not give you an answer why are we seeing so many young people and older people get blood clots all of a sudden this is not something that was happening but they certainly are going to gaslight you into thinking that it is happening", "IrEwIxASsBk": "they had to have the jury believe that it was a neck restraint it was the knee on the neck it was asphyxiation that killed George Floyd however there was a ton of evidence that George Floyd consumed a toxic lethal cocktail of Fentanyl and methamphetamine three grains of fentanyl on the head of a lead pencil enough to kill you enough to kill me and so they had to continuously inculcate the public to believe that Derek Chauvin intentionally premeditatedly murdered George Floyd and drugs had absolutely nothing to do with it", "pHpbvYEgZME": "we're going to be living with the consequences of this in so many different dimensions for not just our generation you're talking about your children and my grandchildren are going to be living with it in so many different ways it's it's profound what we've done absolutely and you know i um it's interesting now because america is sort of glamorized even within the heads of americans as we are always doing the forthright thing i think that's correct and the reason why i brought up pablo escobar because i don't often watch tv but during covert lockdowns i did watch a netflix series that covered papa escobar it's actually fascinating to watch what he was able to do as a poor colombian man you know got involved in cocaine and was able you know became a billionaire and what he moved and it also traced the the origin stories before el chapo of uh marijuana which was the first drug in mexico that they started moving throughout the united states and you know became very wealthy started buying politicians and it sort of sort of set up as in and then america created the dea um this guy kiki cameron got killed he was you know worked for the dea americans went in and we got these bad guys these drugs these drug people who were running the government and this idea in americans have the mexican government is so corrupt right they accept money from drug dealers and they're all working for the drug dealers and taking back and payments from the drug dealers and it's interesting now to look at that and to say we just did it better right we just did it better because it's sufficient to have the same drug marijuana is obviously legalized now but we have drugs that are way worse that you know before marijuana was illegal you were fine to give children heroin essentially right heroin you're fine to give children methamphetamine essentially but as long as you do it behind this umbrella of we're the fda and we've approved this and people don't know the fda takes fees um and so this this is why i called a drug cartel the insurance companies along with the pharmaceuticals and the government the fda and the cdc we pay so much more for our drugs that the rest of the world the pharmaceutical industry generates so much profit and they plow it back into the american political system from the president on down to local school birds and i think a case could be made that at least i'm i'm going to say it more bluntly i think that we're basically financing our our electoral system now through what's basically a tax that we pay to the pharmaceutical industry that comes back as funding for our elections", "isdskkp8bi8": "it's the wrong verdict in my opinion and i think that it's indicative of the fact that we now live in mob rule this is mob rule society i mean this is based on the evidence that we saw and this was polluted from start to finish so to me the most important element of this which i found to be astonishing was the fact that they never released the full police footage they had it they sat on it they locked it down it leaked months and months later after the riots um you know via the daily mail i think but when i watched the full tape i was astonished that they didn't think to just at least add this context so that people understood yes this person was high out of his mind he asked to be put on the ground he was resisting arrest let's not forget what the media what they did the power they had in setting up this narrative to begin with first media said he was just getting his life together do you remember st george you guys remember george right he was just getting his life together he had moved to minnesota yes he was you know had been in prison in the past but he was just helping the youth and everyone was crying and it was oh my gosh this man you know is getting a second chance at life and you know maybe had the wrong id or whatever it was was was using uh counterfeit bills and somebody called the police and then he was killed he was brutally murdered uh on the basis of him being black no indication nothing was said out of derek shobin's mouth that you know should insinuate that this was about being black versus white but that was what the media ran with and then they successfully hid every piece of evidence that would have transformed public opinion right every piece of evidence that would have said wait a second there's more here and they were upset when i released a video and just went over his track record because it was clear to me a coroner's track record that it was very unlikely that a person that spends you know approximately nine prison stints nine stints in prison was really just getting his life together after having served the last one so you know to me i think the saddest part of this is that what we need to acknowledge is that right now mob rules the media creates the mob and the mob rules and that's what we just saw play out let's talk about how unusual that is right that they never released this full footage so that we could at least see the context and see more at least be able to discern more facts other than somebody who's a bystander filming the video and remember when brad parsone i want to bring up brad parscale do you remember how quickly that footage was released when brad parskell you know got arrested when he was drunk and he got into a spout with his wife they released that footage like almost in the next minute it was it was he got arrested on a monday and we had the footage by monday afternoon but george floyd footage it was never for public consumption the daily mail got it months later the video i did 100 million views and they couldn't believe it because oh my gosh i'm alleging that maybe your little child shouldn't be i don't care what's happened maybe she shouldn't be wearing a george shirt maybe they should be getting baptized in george floyd's circle or you know wherever it was they were taking their their children to be baptized they literally tried to turn transform him into a saint you know they wanted to saint this man and all you had to do was look at his record and say he has a wake of victims in his path in his in his past imagine the woman who when he you know got arrested for the armed robbery broke into her home uh put you know put a gun to her stomach her child her her minor child was in the room during that time because he was looking for drugs and money he pretended that they pretended to be the water man you know and he breaks into the home and imagine that woman watching the media saying to this man right you imagine that that that victim and i why i always say this is that actually black female lives definitely don't matter because these black men that they keep hailing as heroes and victims always leave a trail of female black victims in their wake and nobody cares i don't blame the cops and i think we're gonna see this and i do not blame the cops if i had you know if my son grew up and said yeah and said i want to be a police officer i'd say absolutely not are you kidding me none of this stuff would happen these mistakes if people could listen to police officers instructions it's not that hard right and right now you have black americans that are learning that doesn't matter you shouldn't have to in fact the best case scenario is for a police officer to do anything wrong while you're resisting arrest because you will be transformed from a hero when i say transform i'm talking about from a drug dealer from a drug user i mean all of these people from you know an accused rapist into a hero all you have to do is resist the arrest and hope that a police officer makes a mistake in the moment which is likely to happen when adrenaline is running through your in your veins because you're wondering am i going to survive this because police officers also have to go home to families right am i going to live when rashad whatever his name was rashad um who was the guy in atlanta who yeah who grabbed rachael brooks grabbed the taser what are you thinking a police officer is going to think in that moment and yet still the police officers are always demonized there is no incentive right now in this country to be a police officer", "Pns0ICePLFc": "we now have people like judges people that are supposed to be of the most sound mind who are able to look at something objectively and to interpret the law in a way that makes sense they are falling for the farce of this complete spiral that our culture is in right where we are pretending that bad is good and good is bad and that there are no rules and all of us can just live outside of the limitations so no I am not surprised to see that in fact I will take it a step further as I have done in past episodes and make the claim now I'm I'm sad I know I'm going to be right because what's coming around the corner it's going to be polyamorous relationships it's going to be incest they're already having those conversations I read to you guys an episode last week how there already are articles that are planting the seeds why is incest wrong why is polyamorous relationships wrong eventually there's going to be a judge probably in New York or in California who asked this question why", "dfM_jI3IL6M": "I don't like antibiotics in general and I decided to look up exactly what this GBS was what the statistics surrounding it were is this actually going to be harmful to my baby as she's exiting the womb and of course what I found was that dark hole of Statistics that basically told me zero percent of babies are harmed by this if your baby is harmed by this they say that perhaps the baby could stop breathing but there's no way to isolate whether or not that child that stopped breathing stopped breathing because of for say the vitamin K shot that they give your child smooth they come out of the womb or the Hep B shot which is for STDs that they somehow recommend and they're giving to most babies as soon as they are welcomed into this world so for me I go this doesn't really make sense okay and I do not want to take antibiotics or be on a course of antibiotics while I'm giving birth it is my personal choice it was my personal decision", "Z9Hf9N409vs": "so I asked you a question a question that riddle is what is green on the outside and red on the inside and I hope you spent some time thinking deeply the answer is are you ready a watermelon duh which is also an analogy for environmentalism which is really just communism wrapped into stupid policies like the green new deal that's what it is the environmentalism is nothing but a watermelon they are telling you it's about wanting the planet to be clean to protect our planet but in reality what it's inching us toward is a communist Society", "txWHQNR6KrU": "she's starting to really sick at me megan fox drinking blood let's just roll the clip of her talking about what you're talking about today huh i guess it drank each other's blood might mislead people or like people are imagining us with like goblets and we're like game of thrones drinking each other's blood it's just a few drops but yes we do consume each other's blood on occasion for ritual purposes just for the ritual it is used for a reason and it is controlled where it's like let's shed a few drops of blood i need to drink it he's much more haphazard and hectic and chaotic where he's willing to just like cut his chest open with broken glass and be like take my soul let me bleed on it doesn't not happen let me tell you maybe not exactly like that but it a version of that has happened many times this is what a midlife crisis looks like and the thing that's funny about megan fox is that she notoriously went on a rampage against her ex-husband brian austin green because he published a photo of him with his kid they're about to go like a soccer game and she's like no photos of our children on the internet like she's a good parent oh okay but you're going to be on the internet as the mother of this child talking about drinking the blood of your 20 years younger boyfriend however much younger he is like this is disgusting it's satanic it's demonic but it's just like the stupidity behind like i'm protecting my kids because i'm gonna be the person that's a knucklehead out on instagram talking about drinking blood like you know like i'm a you know satan worshiper we'll get right back to the show

candace to get three extra months free go to expressvpn.com candace right now to learn more people are saying that this is unusual behavior this is so crazy and weird and unusual this from the standpoint of world history this is not unusual this is the norm drinking each other's blood and having all sorts of weird rituals and human sacrifice that is the norm throughout every civilization in the history of the world until the ancient israelites come down and say there is a god and we know his name and then jesus comes as the embodiment is the incarnation of that god and says hey stop doing all this weird stuff and it's just so funny that the libs accuse christians of being superstitious and weird and backward and yet they go with their crystals and their blood sacrifices and their weird weird behaviors they're the ones that are going even further back than than any of us old-timey concerns so here's the here's the other possibility is that she is making all this up because she told rolling stone for example that she likes to make stuff up just to mess with journalists so there is a possibility there is that but that it's so irresponsible if even if you're faking this just to you know donny osmond's osmond era agent once said that he wanted to plant drugs because he wanted to change his image and you know get away from the squeaky queen maybe she's doing this but it's disgusting if you're selling your soul whether you're doing it or not we don't know but but the reality is that children are actually cutting themselves people where suicide rates are going up mental illness is going up she is doing something disgusting here whether she's actually doing it or not she is encouraging this behavior the satanic behavior um and her and her fiance a machine gun kelly he's a former heroine and adderall addict we know that he is not a mentally well person and yet we are subscribers mentally well obviously they're making millions of dollars this is what hollywood has become yeah so i mean it used to be you know they used to call it a conspiracy theory when you would talk about the the normalization of occult practices in hollywood and we'd bring up timothy leary who's a student of aleister crowley and all these different things but when you're looking at what she's describing there it actually sounds something very similar to an occult practice known as the black mass and the black mass like pretty much everything in uh in occult traditions is a perversion of the bible right so it's a perversion of the bible the same way that in the abortion debate they say this is my body right right this is my body of course a phrase from the last supper used in the complete opposite and very blasphemous way when christ says this is my body and the same point this is my blood well of course in the last supper and in the mass you drink the you share in the park you partake in the body and blood of christ uh in this in the black mass you are take partaking in the blood of another human so it's it's about transhumanism it's about humans becoming god and that's how they view themselves hollywood views themselves as gods this is why the bible speaks against idolatry you really realize it now when you see how perverse and how backwards yeah it's babylon and and just hear her making it sound like it's cool sitting there i mean she's she's a mom of what three children she's got her boobs out uh this is a hahahaha no like it's just it it sounds bad it's just like a couple of drops but not him he'll take the whole glass shard and do this and try to drip it into my mouth i'm a no drops kind of guy yeah but kids are growing up on the internet to believe is cool this is why i talk about culture and the department of education being combined and this is the result of our society like what we are seeing taking place today people look at her look at machine gun kelly and they go that's what i want when they got when they got you know when he proposed to her she wrote a whole post on instagram which was actually a very lovely post and at the very end she said and then we drank each other's blood and that's why this interviewer is asking her the question is that true and she's like yeah it was just a couple of drops this is the thing is she played so the movie jennifer's body which i've never seen and have no plans to to see but having read descriptions this was a multi-million no i know but it's a disgusting film but it's the same thing it's literally you know she's doing supposedly in real life which she portrayed in this movie which cost millions of dollars to spend or to build and to create and then millions of dollars that were purchased at the box office so the moral i think here is stop subsidizing this tell your friends stop going to see anything from her i mean i and then that's where that's where i'm like okay how do we as conservatives push back on something without delving into cancer culture how do we do

protect your data at expressupn.com Candace obviously we have to get into Nicki Minaj being force-fed the red pill honestly watching her kind of be so shocked and amazed at how the people in the media who she thought were her allies were trying to take her down like they all got a text message take out Nicki Minaj um and her response to people like Tucker Carlson and me defending her it was so reminiscent for me what it was like for me falling down the rabbit hole when I realized that these people that I thought were my friends were evil and so she did an Instagram live and I want to show this clip again sent a very innocent tweet I know one person who had a reaction make sure you think and pray before we make a decision she didn't say don't get the vaccine she didn't say get the vaccine she just said you know be intelligent be smart do your research and uh here is a clip of her on her Instagram page 100 000 people watching live Millions have seen it since here's what she has to say I'm not one of those people that y'all are going to be able to do this with sweetheart okay see the minute you guys started doing going this hard is when this seemed strange to me like and I'm not talking about the representative that that uh Joe and Sal spoke to today I'm talking about just the Democratic party in general and so many people jumping at the chance to okay well hmm we can't um make fun of the actual story anymore and and talk about testicles and balls till they drop dead and make and make that a joke so now we have to uh attack her personally I want you guys to see what is happening 80 percent of the artists that y'all following right now feel like I feel about the vaccine and are too afraid to speak on it and guess what they're doing right now if they assassinate me and assassinate my character and make me look crazy or stupid guess what no one else will ever ask questions again so this represents an existential crisis for the left right because she's got hundreds of millions of followers and they are watching live what the media is doing to her they're watching them essentially just try to take her out and that's not good because that could accidentally awaken them to the fact that Nicki Minaj is not the first person yeah it's a win-win scenario right now because if they take Nicki Minaj out then Nicki Minaj was right and if they don't get her just it opens up the door for everybody else to ask more questions I'm a huge Nicki Minaj fan have been for a long time I was actually supposed to be married to her cousin but there was uh an incident yeah it's on it's on hold now it's on hold now but these chairs are comfy and by the way this is another thing she posted y'all gotta stop pretending to love people with backbones if Malcolm X were here he'd be asking questions and most of you all that holler black lives matter and protect black women would be telling him to shut up and fall in line y'all say these people's names but embody the spirit of a coward I mean this is this is amazing stuff um which is why the White House was quick to respond Jack by the way you have an interesting uh take just to recap the white just recap what happened with the white house so I wasn't aware I think a lot of people were really confused about this Dynamic that was coming out where Nicki Minaj said that she had been invited by the White House people started reporting that she was invited by the White House but suddenly the statement comes out from an unnamed senior White House official saying that she's not invited to the White House but it's merely a conversation with the doctor that we'd be happy to arrange right what's going on Candace the last time that I was on this program In This Very Room what did I tell you there is a shade war going on right now between who team K and Team B Team Kamala and team Biden so pop quiz which side do you think it was that immediately saw the opportunity here and reached out to Nicki Minaj team K all the way exactly team K reaches out they make the first foray they make the first communication with Nicki Minaj team Biden finds out about it from the Press because they were trying to run an end around and I'm I imagine that you probably had a uh a red-haired kind of shrill voice as that senior staffer saying well there isn't an official an invitation coming out here and we'll have to Circle uh not around yes yeah totally Anonymous no that's what's going on here and and so to understand that this is more of the shade war that we talked about the last time that's coming out now because Kamala Harris was trying to sit down with Nicki Minaj and cut Joe Biden out right I mean this is this is insane and I'm shocked at how vicious they they were in within 24 hours they even had the Trinidad Health Minister speak out right Trinidad Minister criticizes rappers vaccine tweet and he came out and he basically said she's a liar and we we've been busy the last 24 hours seeing if what she said was chewing was wrong I just want to be very clear they've administered a million a million doses of the covid-19 vaccine trade I looked into it wow all right and somehow this Minister within 24 hours was able to verify that absolutely no one had a reaction I mean this is crazy stuff and there are people that just believe it they eat it up you know they just think there's no way what Nicki Minaj says is true and they just accept that it's only true if it comes from Dr fauci like there's just no way that human beings are having a bad reaction to the vaccine yeah it's it's a it's really a beautiful thing to watch really just to see how hard everybody's going at Nicki Minaj and I think they mess with the wrong girl because she's she's not backing down from the fight into what you're saying I would love to be a fly in the Oval Office when somebody was trying to explain who Nick Minaj was to Joe Biden [Applause] he's just a mirage my butt's been wiped I had a feeling Hunter might know exactly honestly if you had if you have a gun in my head I'd go with Hunter yeah going online without expressvpn is like using your smartphone without a protective case most

radical Religion Today ready for the answer the answer is of course environmentalism environmentalism is the most radical religion today and I can't say enough about that every time I examine this cult because that's what it is is it actually a cult I just cannot stop remarking on how it has been impressed upon our children think about it you've read the headlines of kids that are skipping school they're leaving school because they just can't deal with the idea that not more is being done to clean up the climate to clean up carbon emissions that people don't care that they're all going to be dead in 10 years they actually believe us kids believe that they're going to be dead in 10 years if they don't do something about the climate", "AggETx4A_1c": "double question of the day first question is does the CIA want to control your mind I'll give you the answer to that of course it's yes if you're looking at the history of the CIA which brings me to my second question have you heard of the CIA operation MK Ultra let's talk about that plus Pete Davidson is back and he's apparently dating Emily rojakowski and it's getting weird people all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] thank you okay so there's a lot on my mind today so I'm just going to Splatter at you I'm just gonna talk at you and it sort of begins with the CIA program MK Ultra which like all very bad CIA programs they tell us that it's been discontinued and we get no more information about it and we're supposed to believe that it magically went away so let's talk about MK Ultra MK Ultra was a top secret CIA project in which the agency conducted hundreds of experiments sometimes on unwitting U.S citizens to assess the potential use of LSD and Other Drugs for mind control okay so this is about mind control and why was the CIA interested in controlling the minds of masses well I guess the first answer is because they're the CIA the second answer is because in the 1950s and the 1960s at the height of the Cold War the United States government were fearful that the Soviets and the Chinese people were using mind control to brainwash U.S prisoners of war in Korea they were so fearful of this that they said well we then should be controlling the minds of people that's so that's what they started to do they started a program which involved more than 150 human experiments with psychedelic drugs paralytics and electroshock therapy now sometimes the subjects knew that they were being experimented on other times they completely didn't kind of notoriously you guys might be familiar with Whitey Bulger he talked about how when he was in prison they were doing these experiments on the inmates and all of the crazy things that they would see as they were being dosed with LSD they began experimenting with LSD under the direction of a chemist and a poison expert named Sydney Gottlieb and he believed that the agency could harness the drugs mind-altering properties for brainwashing or psychological torture think about this this is this is really crazy there was an operation a project under MK Ultra that was called operation midnight climb MX and what do they do well the CIA paid prostitutes to drug unsuspecting men and they thought that this was a perfect audience to do this too because the men would be so ashamed that they were with a prostitute that they wouldn't then say something terrible happened to me or report it to police officers and they didn't just observe this by talking to the prostitute after she had drugged them and say hey what happened they actually created a room this CIA put together a room in one of their notorious safe houses and they actually had the experiments take place behind a two-way mirror they were watching it live imagine you're a CIA agent and you're paying a prostitute and this person this unsuspecting man thinks he's going to sleep with a prostitute in reality he has stepped into a CIA safe house and there are some agents behind the wall that are watching him and seeing how he reacts to being drugged with LSD that actually took place your government did this and you should know that you should know that because it got worse than that they were also drugging people that were in hospitals unsuspectingly and probably most notoriously they were drugging one another the CIA just at the day at the office typical day at the office would slip LSD into one of their agents coffees to see how he would react to it I say it's that part was rather notorious because that actually led to the death of one individual his name was Frank Olson Frank Olson was a scientist who worked for the CIA and at a 1953 CIA Retreat he drank a cocktail that had been secretly spiked with LSD what happened well just a few short days later he tumbled to his death from the window of a New York City hotel room in an alleged suicide that seems a little bizarre but don't think too much of it that would make you a conspiracy theorist it's totally normal that they were unwittingly drugging people with LSD all the time now why am I bringing this up to today why is this on my mind today well if you want to know how that concludes there was Congressional hearings don't you guys love Congressional hearings it's like the government wants you to think that they're doing something to change things like we're going to have a congressional hearing to show that this is unacceptable Hillary Clinton what happened with these emails no comment no comment nothing happens ever well same idea when the CIA gets caught doing stuff they had Congressional hearings they declined to answer a lot of questions said that they didn't remember anything and that was it supposed to believe that the program magically ended well of course the government's interest in controlling the minds of the masses did not end there we know there were other programs like operation Mockingbird in which CIA agents were littered throughout the mainstream media so knowing that they're interested in influencing your ideas it is of course a natural conclusion that they are interested in controlling Hollywood right do you really think it's a coincidence that everybody that's in Hollywood that has a platform is in lockstep in all of their opinions the there's no variation in opinions you know what they think because they have a platform right they are my body my choice and they supported Hillary Clinton throughout the election and every time they're angry about anything they're all posting black squares and everything just feels like somebody's just calling them up and saying do this right now I was thinking about this today because I watched an old clip of Dave Chappelle Dave Chappelle I'm not talking about his recent Saturday Night Live performance but I'm talking about Dave Chappelle if you don't recall this I'm going to remind you of back when we were told the public was told that Dave Chappelle was crazy that he had a mental break you remember these articles that started to appear you may be kind of foggy here and going yeah I do kind of remember that Dave Chappelle disappeared for a while and it turned out that he went to Africa he just up and went to Africa and walked away from a 50 million dollar contract and so I was reminding myself of this and going when did he sort of arrive back like why did now suddenly he's hosting SNL again he's being accepted back into the good graces of Hollywood he's got Netflix deals not a typical Arc for somebody who's just we've been told is mentally crazy so what what happened what changed and I found this old interview between him and Oprah took place in 2006 after he left and he is talking about why he left right right in this interview he's talking about how there were all these weird pressures where suddenly there were individuals that were trying to encourage him as a black man to wear a dress like there was this he thought it was a bit weird and he thought there was some sort of a conspiracy because he was like no I don't want to wear this dress but they kept wanting him to put on a dress and he thought that was weird and he was under a lot of pressure and he was arguing with Executives not just about the dress but about the content that he was producing he was in the spotlight and then something even more bizarre happens right they essentially start leaking stories about him in the press that aren't true so at first they start saying that he has pneumonia and then they start saying that he's ha he has writer's block but don't let me tell you I want you to actually listen to Dave Chappelle in his own words speaking to Oprah in 2006. take a listen I still haven't gotten to why you just disappeared so you had that moment the guy's laughing too much was that the Tipping Point for you was at the straw that was the first Tipping Point okay and then they put in the paper that I had uh pneumonia God knows what it was walking pneumonia because I was walking all over the place uh I was relaxing uh and then after that I I was coming back to the show and uh then they were like well Dave you know you should just back up the pneumonia story and I was like I'm you know that was your thing I'm not I'm not backing up a pneumonia story so so pause there so that's interesting immediately because what he's saying is that they just inserted a story about him that wasn't true right they're just just say you have pneumonia just back up this claim let's continue and hear what else he says and then the next day was in the paper that I had writer's block then I knew something was getting ready to get stressful because I hadn't even started writing it was I was on schedule to write so I was like what's you know what's going on are they going so these are your people trying to feed manipulate me sounds like somebody's trying to put young Dave in a compromising position okay so that's interesting he's speaking about handlers this idea of Hollywood handlers that are trying to manipulate the narrative trying to control some sort of a narrative and he's he's wise to it he's realizing wait a second something's going on here let's keep going but you know okay so now I got worse when I say I'm not gonna do it then all of a sudden I was like well now he is walking pneumonia and then I knew long before I walked I had considered walking you had considered I had to consider walking because I went back to work and the vitamin love was gone because it was a real ugly negotiation it's a situation where now everybody's taking credit for this and that and the others all it's just it was getting ridiculous and I knew I was going to leave so I got a head of schedule and I bounced and I didn't tell anybody where I was going the whole time they trying to convince me I'm insane stop right there he's essentially telling us that he escaped he just got up and he left because he realized that this was a toxic situation and they were trying to convince him that he was insane let's keep going they were trying to get me to take psychotic medication yeah like I'm sitting around you know I was stressed out but the people that were telling me I was insane I believe that they knew what was going on so uh this was Troublesome yeah so I'm not taking this medicine man because I know these people be trying to control you or or maybe this credit I was afraid like but you were stressed out that's right no question but is very stressful for someone to constantly walk behind you and say you're insane wow just to recap there okay he's not able to be controlled and he's pushing back against Executives and then all of a sudden he starts to realize that there are Stories being leaked about him in the Press first suggesting that he has pneumonia it's not true then suggesting that he has writer's block then he starts having a bunch of people around him telling him that he's crazy trying to convince him that he's crazy and trying to get him to take psychotic medications why would they do that and what Dave Chappelle is being really clear here about is that he felt that they were involved in this narrative the people around him were colluding essentially to present this narrative but he was crazy to try to get him to take the medicine and he's very clear that what a bunch of people keep telling you that you're crazy you'll start to question your own sanity you'll start to wonder hey what is going on here am I crazy I think it's very telling and the reason why it's sent to chill down my spine is because I had heard this version of events very recently I have not been shy about the fact that I am friends with yay formerly known as Kanye West and he shared a very similar experience with me before this entire Fallout took place interesting fact about Kanye is that he's been in the public sphere since 1996. but Kanye West was never called crazy despite being in the public from 1996 all the way through to 2015 he was never called crazy ever by the media until he did what he put on the Mac hat he put on a red hat and said that he wanted to support Donald Trump for president he likes Donald Trump for president and then what happened well he was told by a person that was very close to him that in order to get his life back right he needed to just say that he was crazy so a close friend of his that close friend is Harley pastern at Carly pasternik is a trainer to the Stars right he trains all of the stars all of the celebrities he trained Brittany Murphy remember her she was we were told she was crazy and then she wound up dead and he was involved in her documentary while he trained Kanye West he was a friend of his he said Kanye you're actually you're not a conservative you don't support the Maga movement actually what's wrong with you is um you're having a psychotic break you should take some psychotic medicines and it was Harley pasternik that then called 9-1-1 and had Kanye sent to the hospital and it was hardly passionate that then leaked that to TMZ that Kanye West was having a mental break you guys remember that right and then suddenly we were all told that he has bipolar disorder and he believed it he believed that something was wrong with him like obviously everyone around him is saying You couldn't possibly like Donald Trump so he believed that he was bipolar right and so it's interesting to consider Harley pastritic why is Harley Patrick an interesting character well the first thing is his background Harley pasternik actually served as a scientist at the Department of National Defense DND defense and civil Institute for environmental medicine that is um they support the Canadian Armed Forces okay so he was a scientist for two years at drdc Toronto a military research station that is part of the DND the drdc researches human systems integration social and psychological factors that affect the resolution of conflict psychology of malicious intent and social and cultural factors influencing Behavior could be relevant could also not be relevant but it's interesting that he then becomes a trainer and he's got this background and then he encourages Kanye West to take medicine and has him committed to the hospital because he put on a Maga hat now all of that of course could be oh well whatever maybe Harley thought that Kanye really was having an episode and was just trying to help us run except recently and what's really interesting about this is that the Press has been completely silent on it Harley pashnik made another appearance this time it was on Kanye's Twitter feed when he was going after various people in his life Kanye tweeted that he was misdiagnosed right and his friend Harley misdiagnosed him back in 2016. and Kane also shared um his exactly it was what should be obvious by now is that I was raised to stand for my truth regardless of consequences so I will say this again I was mentally misday diagnosed and nearly drugged out of my mind to make me a manageable well-behaved celebrity I'm sorry what in case you think he's just saying that and he's just being crazy because that sounds crazy what do you mean they were just going to drug you to make you to manage you that sounds insane in case you think it's crazy he also shared a text from Harley a recent text from Harley passionate this is what Harley pasternick wrote to Kanye I'm going to help you one of a couple of ways first you and I sit down and have a loving and open conversation but you don't use cuss words and everything that is discussed is based in fact and not some crazy stuff that dumb friend of yours told you or you saw in a tweet second option this is where it gets interesting I have you institutionalized again where they medicate the crap out of you and you go back to Zombieland forever play date with the kids just won't be the same that is written to him by his I guess somebody just helping him at the gym his trainer I'll have you institutionalized again I'll send you back to Zombieland talking about drugging a man so he doesn't recognize his own children and the media has stayed radio silent on this so that to me is the conspiracy why on Earth would the media remain radio silent on the fact that Harley passionate is openly admitting that he had something to do with Kanye being institutionalized once and he is threatening to do it again in what world is that legal again that uh there are a lot of questions that should be asked and we should have the courage to ask them because it is getting very scary out there and we are starting to recognize that our government is involved in way more than we could have ever imagined and that's all I have to say about that okay I want to take a moment to talk to you

Candace to get three months free okay now it's time for some topics to show [Music] so first up in case you missed this yesterday Pete Davidson you guys know Pete Davidson he was on Saturday Night Live his personal life was bigger than his character on Saturday Night Live in fact he just objectively not that funny Saturday Night Live always has been suffering from a lack of comedy and he I think was a part of this nothing that he really did was that funny and despite this the mainstream media has praised this guy since he got since he came onto the scene right he has been dating a ton of A-list beautiful women nobody really understands why he at first was dating Ariana Grande in fact he got engaged to her and then she broke off the engagement uh then he was dating Kaya Gerber who is a beautiful Top Model who's now dating Austin Butler he then was dating Kate Beckinsale a tiny bit older absolutely beautiful then I think the most notoriously began dating Kim Kardashian following her separation from Kanye and this sort of led to a mud slinging within the Press obviously I am biased but I think I am accurately biased which is to say that I think I'm on the right side here that I don't like Pete Davidson because of the whole Kanye Fiasco because it just points to the hypocrisy of the media uh the media was incessantly telling us that Kanye was crazy Kanye was crazy Kanye was crazy because he was obviously sleeing a lot of mud at Pete Davidson who was publicly going all around with his still wife even though they were separated and you might think that's crazy except the Press declined to comment on the fact that Pete Davidson had gotten Kanye's children's named tattoo onto his body so what man in their right mind sees that you're dating his ex-wife or his still wife but separated right for a couple of months and then you go and you extremely he got like six tattoos all of Kim and then it culminated he also got branded remember don't forget this we're talking about crazy Kim Kardashian went on the Ellen generous show she said I have been brand that Pete Davidson got an actual brand of her on his body that's actually insane and then it comes into him getting a tattoo of all of her children's names all of Kanye's children's names Kanye reacts to that and the Press says it's Kanye that's crazy not Pete Pete's not crazy it's totally fine even though we know that Pete also went to a psychiatric hospital after he was dating Kaya Gerber he had some sort of a mental break with the Press protects him at all causes and makes it seem like he's just this amazing guy they always talk about how he just got a huge package it's very sexy very much sexualized him and all women should want him so I don't know what's going on or if he's got the greatest agent at CAA ever but he keeps dating more and more women that are very attractive and now he's with Emily rajkowski who is also just putting from her husband after claims of infidelity she claims her husband has been Infidel of course Emily rajkowski has also been Infidel she's always naked on the internet I feel like I've personally had sex with her that's how based on touching her naked and yet somehow people think of her as a victim and now she's with Pete Davidson again I just I'm bringing this not because it's important but because this finds the presses the press the media Obsession I should say with Pete Davidson and trying to make us believe but he's just this totally stable guy who is just very attractive to very beautiful women I find it to be suspect it's something that I've just been tracking for a while and going something a little odd about Pete Davidson and that's all I'm gonna say about that I want to move on to a more important story just because it again points to hypocrisy so 10 year old boy asks to go to the school nurse because he wants the nurse to put Vaseline on his new tattoo so the nurse sees this tattoo and she calls the police and it turns out the boy had gotten tattooed with his mother's permission from a neighbor according to local authorities now some states have no minimum age for receiving a tattoo if a parent allows it but in New York which is where this took place you have to be 18 or older so both the tattoo artist who was a guy named Austin Smith who was 20 years old and was not licensed and the boy's mother were arrested now my boy's mother's 33 years old the pictures of the boy's arm stirred outrage all across new sites and social media and Dr Cora Bruner who is a pediatrician and a professor at the University of Washington Medical Centers Seattle Children's Hospital she has come out and she has said a tattoo is a permanent Mark or symbol that you are putting on your body and I don't think that kids under 18 have that kind of agency to make a decision we need to look at these laws again now let me say that on its face I am totally fine with people being outraged that 10 year old got a tattoo I actually totally agree that 10 year old does not possess within them the ability to quite understand this is a permanent Mark they're going to have forever and the the fact what his mother allowed him to do this calls into question her sanity what I like to point to those is the tremendous hypocrisy here that you now have a pediatrician and you have psychologists and professors coming out and saying this is really wrong kids don't have the ability to make this decision but I bet if you follow their train of thought and you started talking about the transgendered agenda hmm these same professors and doctors would say of course a child understands that they want to chop their penis off of course a child who understands that they want to take medicine to block their puberty which of course has very severe educations for the rest of their life these exact same individuals who are saying that this tattoo is so wrong are fully on board with what is happening in the classroom if you want me to be if I had to pick both of these things are bad if I depict between giving my 10 year old a tattoo make nutrition for him or allowing my children to take puberty blockers I would take door a every single time so again I find the story to be hypocritical and I would have no doubt that these same School nurses were talking about New York who are being told not to inform the parent if their child has concerns about their gender the stuff that they're actually brainwashing them within classroom right those that same nurse would not have called the cops had that child have been administered puberty blockers which is what they're trying to get past these are the state laws that everyone's trying to get past to pretend that children are somehow I don't know have the autonomy the bodily autonomy to be able to decide whether or not they want to get these procedures and surgeries and to take these pills and the last thing that I will say to point to the irony is that this is happening in New York state which essentially forced a bunch of children to get vaccinated against covid in order to be able to go back to school and we knew the in the implications early on the media is just now admitting it oh my God we actually didn't know that this could cause myocarditis so I'll bet can't say it for sure that that kid was totally cleared to go and get a shot for something that he had a virtual 100 percent chance of surviving a little virus that he would have been fine surviving but the shot which could have given him myocarditis they would have said was totally safe and effective again don't agree with children getting tattoos but also don't agree with any of the other nonsense so I just like to keep it ideologically consistent it is no exaggeration to say that becoming a mother has been the greatest joy of my life being able to bring life into this world is a miracle that every mother and child deserves unfortunately our society has brainwashed us into believing that these precious lives are nothing more than clumps of cells that is why I am so excited to let you guys guys know that my show has partnered with pre-born pregnancy clinics preborn is a pro-life Ministry that provides ultrasounds to women who are considering abortion when a mother sees their child and hears their heartbeat she will more often than not choose life work that they are doing is so important I want to share a client testimonial with you guys so that you can hear it in one of the mother's own words take a listen to Olivia's story so Race's father is um he was my mentor we met working at the shop I was comfortable being along with him I thought we were good friends I kind of took that as an opportunity to just get to know him on a deeper level I guess he wasn't interested in that and he was more interested in the physical aspect of everything when I found out I was pregnant he was not okay with that either he pushed for an abortion and that's how I came to the clinic so I felt like the only ones that were really there for me were the women at the clinic and it actually did Empower me and help me I was late enough to get my ultrasound still remember you know feeling everything um is changing I said I would not get an abortion so I was going to raise this baby with or without him so he said without I think if I didn't find the clinic then I probably would have considered abortion the women there are just so kind they're just so genuine I would not be this strong without the clinic my dreams now revolve around my son I want to let people know that it's not over no matter what age you are you know you find out you're pregnant it's not over and that there's there are places to go and I want the individuals that are involved in the clinic to know how much we are all eternally grateful for everything that they do if I did abort my son I would live with many regrets now that I have them I don't think I can be in this world without him my son saved me I can honestly say that changed my life for the better over the past 16 years preborn has canceled over 450 000 women considering abortion and saved more than 188 000 babies preborn introduces expectant mothers to their children via ultrasound and 80 percent of the time she's more likely to choose Life One ultrasound costs just 28 dollars you can sponsor five ultrasounds for 144 dollars however if you are in a place to give more please do so through a match program going on right now your tax deductible gift is doubled whatever you donate you'll be saving twice as many children together we are on a mission to rescue 1500 babies before the end of this year and I know that we can do it donate securely dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby that's pound 250 baby or go to preborn.com Candace that's preborn.com Candace you consider yourself pro-life now is the time to act help us save 1500 babies at preborn.com Candace today jumping in to the next story and talking about creepy teachers and a creepy education system project Veritas you guys know them they are our friends love James O'Keefe had them on this program many times they released a new video today exposing an educator that worked at a worked past tense because of the Scandal worked in a prestigious Connecticut private school you guys know that I am from Connecticut so this story hit me differently it just makes me so terrified my sister still lived there so there is a an educator named Iman rosti who made sexually explicit statements about his current high school students now he oversees green Farms Academy's Writing Center and he also teaches Middle School English and is the seventh grade Dean so this is not some new guy just got here he was recorded fantasizing about his young female pupils I'd like to apologize in advance but take a listen to what he said in his own words they make sure that position in a way that I actually see the thing that's just truth yes I mean literally not with my K-12 but College [Music] students so he's being turned on by underwear that his peoples are wearing and then he also goes as far as to say that he's also had sex with some of the college students that he sees and all this has been caught on camera and uh of course it has been received the right way people are understandably outraged and this person as an update has been removed but it's ridiculous to me that it takes a project Veritas reporter to be able to go undercover and we bring these stories to the Forefront because it is very obvious that they are trying to destroy relationships that children have with their parents uh because they are looking to create relationships to have those relationships mimicked inside the classroom and it's why I'm constantly talking about all these various agendas and when they're saying don't tell your mom this or don't tell your dad that and then you have a bunch of people that are working that are talking to your children about sex wildly inappropriate used to not take place in America before the 1970s right sex education was something that was thought up by ideologues Planned Parenthood got involved trying to teach your children about everybody's just having sex so we should learn about it in school actually everybody was not having sex the majority of the student population was graduating with their virginity intact outside of high school and now it's the exact reverse because they're teaching sex in the classroom they are intentionally sexualizing children and at the same time somehow sexualizing the adults in the classroom again I am speaking generally I'm not of course talking that I'm not of course suggesting that every teacher is horrific and every teacher has sexual fantasies about your children but I am saying that what will come down the pipeline right if we don't stand up to these more nefarious agendas like kids being told as young as kindergarten that they can pick their genders and that their genitals don't mean anything what do you think is going through the natural product of this and when you see these teachers that are fighting for the right to talk to your kids about sex yeah you're looking at somebody who is a predator somebody whose mind is not right and should not be in the classroom and that's all I'm going to say on that topic the last thing I want to talk to you about is about today in our news Roundup is this very weird story and of course more details are going to come out about it but for University of Idaho students were found dead in their off-campus home that they shared and all the police officers are saying is that it was a crime of passion they won't say anything else the students names were Ethan Chapin Madison Mogan Zannah kernodle and Kaylee goncalves they were 20 21 20 and 21 respectively and they were all found dead in the house that they shared in Moscow Idaho on Sunday and again the police nor the parents are disclosing how exactly they died it's obviously a tremendously sad situation I do know for a fact that there was no guns involved of course or you would know Democrats would be marching about gun legislation there was one individual that was on Twitter who was tweeting up a daily wire saying that he had more details and we have reached out to him regarding it because it's just a story that of course with wanting to fully respect the parents that are involved and are going through this tremendous tragedy it's something that we want to share to the public because it's scary the idea you could send your child to a college campus and that all of them would die again uh I I would think if I had seen the story and hadn't seen the phrase Crime of Passion that it was related to a drug overdose but that would is obviously wrong because why would they refer to it as a crime of passion so what I said is purely speculative but we are following this story the police are saying that they're still trying to narrow down exactly what it is that happened it's one of a plenitude of possibilities including a burglary gone wrong or a robbery gone wrong any of those is a possibility and not one to the exclusion of others again incredibly vague statement which came from the police and we should all be paying attention to that story and that is all that I will say on that okay you guys know that I am apocalypse-minded my husband and I are always talking about how we would survive if we had to to live off of our own land and fend for ourselves hopefully it never comes to that but in case it does you probably should be prepared now is the time to get emergency food from one of my favorite sponsors my Patriot Supply act now and you'll save 250 off their three-month emergency food kit when you

earthwire.com okay now it's time for my daily comment Roundup where I hope that you guys are being nice to me in the comments but you're usually not and it's okay because I keep coming back for more abuse so the first comment is from Rachel Johnson and it is regarding the government Wars she says thank you for mentioning mentioning the government's role in creating addicts through prescription medication I work in substance abuse treatment and the amount of clients who got their start on Reckless amounts of poorly supervised prescriptions is just gross and alarming you are correct it is both gross and alarming and what's especially gross and alarming about it is the fact that when drug dealers kill people or create addicts of people they are actually held accountable and they serve printed prison sentences and get for whatever reason the vaccine manufacturers are just told they have to pay a fine right a billion dollar fine to the government and nobody ever gets in trouble so of course if you're a pharmaceutical person you're thinking okay whatever we're creating a bunch of addicts for making so much money that at the time comes and we do get caught all we have to do is pay a fine who cares because we know that these addicts are going to be knocking on the door looking for the next thing so I don't like the hypocrisy of that Jerry Davidson on the same topic says Candace in the case of the war in Ukraine I have to disagree with you and it's on this basis back in the 90s we convinced Ukraine to give up their nukes it is our responsibility for to protect them as we are now I don't know about the money laundering thing at all as a vet they are fighting and fighting hard for their land usually I can agree with you but in this I see that you are wrong Jerry I am going to have to disagree right back at you first and foremost we should clarify Ukraine was not convinced to give up their nukes Ukraine obviously after the fall of the USSR they became Ukraine and before that the nukes that were in their country belong to the Soviets so we just kind of picked up the Soviets old nukes it was not owned by Ukraine and it's in and of itself it's important to make that distinction first and foremost the second thing I want to say is that under no circumstances is it our responsibility to take care of somebody else I'm I'm fundamentally against that idea I think in has led to so much toxicity worldwide this kind of concept after World War II that we needed to lean into International liberalism and oh the United Nations and the world economic forum and all these things are trying to get us to lock hands globally and it it is the birth of globalism and I believe that globalism is leading to every disaster that we see today if you're in Saudi Arabia and you are of a and you live under religious rule you may not want the same things that Candace and Tennessee wants and it is there's a part of it that's almost arrogant we Americans must rescue everybody everybody wants us to rescue them and again as I said yesterday examine the consequences when have we ever done that and had it worked out what ends up happening is that people say that they don't want Americans there so we shouldn't be so presumptuous to assume that because zelensky is saying that they want to join NATO and zelenski May in fact want to do that same as the oligarchs that are funding zelinski does not meet up the people on the ground want that it's our idea that we should be there and to be honest it is our desires us wanting to expand NATO right to have a military presence that keeps expanding Eastward that has played at least some role in everything that is happening in that region today so a lot of the wars again are happening because of our idea that we need to have a hand everywhere and I have a more nationalist approach in believing that every country should mind its own business beginning with us maybe ending with us as well next comment this one is regarding Ali London who we covered yesterday the person that is detransitioning after six months of a transition from a British man into what he believed was a Korean girl but then he realized after six months that it was a joke and he found God and now he's getting attention for being uh I don't know a person that found God someone says Candace I'm a great fan of your Brilliance but sometimes you may be a bit more cynical than necessary as stated if the trans man did find God and then decided to try to undo his past tragic decisions that had been likely fueled by attention gluttony opportunism and greed he could have just taken his self-mutilation money and retired however regardless of any payoff he's personally receiving I respect that his powerful personal story is being used to Spotlight the horrendous crimes against our children his voice speaking the truth and giving God credit speaks louder and with more credibility on the topic than even the most logical argument delivered by an eloquent Communicator I agree I said yesterday I think it is a net positive that he is speaking out against the transition Army as I like to call them now but I do just have to say I maybe I am being cynical I'm a little suspicious within six months you go from here to here to here to here like yeah I get it people live through experiences and it transforms them but I am more inclined to believe someone who I would say lived as a man for longer just a lot has happened in a short amount of time anyways I'm agreeing with you I am cynical and I agree that he's a net positive of all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Trump who may be making a very big announcement tonight and I maybe received an invite so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "Y64NCz-2XBo": "what if this actually happened ready what if I tweeted one day that the CIA and the Mossad were going to attempt to frame me and then torture me to death and then four hours after that tweet I was found dead in an ocean what would you think you think that it was just an accident that the timing of my tweet was suspicious and then I naturally drowned I'm asking you that question for a reason I'm asking you because it's actually happened to somebody and this story that I read completely sent a shiver up my spine I think that it will send one up yours as well plus later on in the show we're going to be talking about thousands of convicted pedophiles in California who are being released from prison in less than a year for horrific Acts including rape sodomy and sexual abuse of children under 14 according to a new investigation all that and more today coming up on Candace Owens [Music] all right you guys so first and foremost I want to say that it makes me so happy to see that there are still issues that can unite people on the left and the right that there is not a gray area when it comes to pedophilia and when it comes to grooming children and that is the reason that hashtag Balenciaga groomers has been trending for over a week now people are upset people are going after the Kardashians and it feels like finally we are agreeing on a moral issue I love that except there is one group of people that are noticeably silent people in Hollywood they seem like they just want this to go away they have no interest in leaning in and this is bizarre because they love leaning in on political issues they love cancer culture right Holly would love perpetuating cancer culture let you be found in a mega hat and they want you canceled let George Floyd be killed they want black squares they want something to scream about and something to say I am a virtuous person so it's bizarre that they're being super silent and of course this is leading to conspiracy theories conspiracy theories one that keeps popping up which is that there is an elite pedophile ring operating within Hollywood that seems crazy right I was thinking about this and thinking about the Epstein case Jeffrey Epstein of course we all know that case we have been following it in the news people believe that he was murdered in prison other people believe that he legitimately hung himself doesn't matter I'm not ish I'm not interested in going down that path when I'm interested in covering today though is something that I never spoke about before which is that when this case was going on a lot of people were sending me information claiming get this and I'm going to be clear at this this sounded to me like a conspiracy theory that Jeffrey Epstein was a part of our intelligence agencies right that he was actually operating a black male ring and this is the reason why nobody would prosecute him because he was a protected CIA asset right so the idea is that Jeffrey Epstein would get very powerful people to attend his parties who would bring them out on the Lolita Express he would bring him to his island in the Caribbean remember he somehow had enough money to purchase an entire Island little Saint James and he would get them to sleep with women maybe unbeknownst to them that these women were very young and then he'd have blackmail he recorded the acts and then suddenly he had control over people all around the world because hey if you don't do what we say we're going to show this video of you sleeping with a 14 year old at some sounds crazy right I thought it sounded crazy and so I never reported on it I just sort of stayed out of it and just reported on the strangeness it was absolutely of course it was bizarre that this man seemed to keep falling through the cracks of our legal system despite all of the evidence that he was involved in sex crimes and by the way this conspiracy theory of him operating a black man ring didn't come from nowhere actually it came from somewhere it came from Alexander Acosta being just one individual that leaned into this conspiracy theory uh he was the former U.S attorney if you don't remember Alexander Acosta he was a former U.S attorney who was also selected by President Trump to be the labor secretary of the United States and throughout his confirmation hearings a lot of people in the Press were saying this guy allowed Jeffrey Epstein to get off scot-free and so throughout his interviews with the Trump Administration he was asked about that and he asked the question is the Epstein case going to cause a problem pertaining to his confirmation hearings he had been he explained breezily apparently that back in the day he had had just one meeting on the Epstein case he had cut the non-prosecution deal with one of Epstein's attorneys because he altered Acosta had been told to back off that Epstein was above his pay grade he said quote I was told Epstein belonged to intelligence and to leave it alone he told interviewers in the Trump transition So that obviously makes people believe that it's true that he Alexander Costa was simply told hey you got to let this guy go he's an asset and that would sort of make sense as to why he kept slipping through the cracks of the legal system but there's more there's more stuff that is the reason people believe that this is all true in case you missed this in the news Jeffrey Epstein and by the way you can find these articles and NBC News The Washington Post this is not stuff that I'm finding on some conspiracy website this is known in the mainstream media but all of this is true so Jeffrey Epstein used a foreign passport with a fake name to enter several countries in the 1980s including the United Kingdom Spain and Saudi Arabia that is weird the passport contained a photo of Epstein with a different name and listed his place of residence as Saudi Arabia that's according to Federal prosecutors now how bizarre is that they open a safe and they find a passport a working passport which allows him to get into all of these countries and it's a fake name which lists his residence in Saudi Arabia who would have the power to issue a fake passport to Jeffrey Epstein it was a fact that he had a fake passport it's a fact that he used that big passport to enter different countries is a fact that nobody can explain how he was wealthy enough to purchase I to purchase an island it is a fact that he kept slipping through the legal system it is a fact that Alexander Acosta said that he was told to let him go who would have that much power I'm just going to ask you the questions I don't even need to spin a conspiracy theory I just need to actually present the facts to you then of course was the Strange Case of Elaine Maxwell and her father her father died under mysterious circumstances this is from a Washington Post article in 1991 her father's name was Robert Robert Maxwell the article says Maxwell whose body was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean off The Cannery Islands last Tuesday after he disappeared from his yacht was buried late this afternoon in judaism's most prestigious spot the cemetery of Jerusalem's Mount of Olives facing the Western Wall his funeral service in Jerusalem's Hall of the people was attended by a host of Israeli politicians led by prime minister Shamir and president Herzog who eulogized the self-made Tycoon as a man cast in a heroic mold okay so the conspiracy theories online was that Jeffrey Epstein was linked to the Mossad and the CIA and that he was an asset and what added to that theory I should say because I cannot confirm this I don't want you to walk away and say Candace confirm this is true was that Elaine Maxwell's father had a lot of power a lot of power in Israel I mean how powerful person you have to be to get both the president and the prime minister to attend your funeral and he also died in mysterious circumstances right just kind of drowning yeah now why am I bringing this up today obviously because as I said I was happy to see that people have been so vocal and uh so consistent in their response against balenciaga's campaign and realizing that something weird is happening in Hollywood and it seems to me that I would I would never suggest that all of these celebrities that are staying quiet are all pedophiles that would seem too ridiculous to me but I do think they're fearful of something that maybe it's something vain like Kim Kardashian just not wanting to not get those free clothes from Balenciaga or maybe they're scared maybe they understand that there is something that is more powerful than them and they have seen people that have tried to speak against powerful systems right and they've had their entire lives ruined something very very strange happened and I want to bring this to your attention because it requires your attention it requires your thought and I want you to focus on this there was a man who's a cryptocurrency millionaire and as you know there's a lot going on in the crypto world right now and one of the things that was going on is that a lot of very young crypto Millionaires and billionaires are being found dead in the last couple of weeks three of them have been found dead in mysterious circumstances okay so Nikolai meshugen Michigan pardon my pardon me 29 years old he died on October 28th hours after tweeting that he feared the CIA and the Mossad were going to murder him this is it's not going Spirit he tweeted this actually his tweet read quote the CIA and the Mossad and pedo Elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean islands they are going to frame me with a laptop planted by my ex-girlfriend who was a spy they will torture me to death blackmail ring operating out of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean the Caribbean obviously uh well one thing that's true is that Epstein had an island in the Caribbean right just off the coast of Saint Thomas and Tortola there's an island little Saint James that is where his Island was and again it was a theory that he was a part of a black male ring but that sounds crazy that sounds this guy tweets this okay it doesn't mean that it's true he tweets that and then what happens oh four hours later he was found dead was found dead by a surfer in Puerto Rico and you might think okay Candice Well maybe he went for a swim and he happened to drown maybe he didn't know but he couldn't swim maybe the waves were bad that day and he went for a swim I want to believe that because I would much rather believe that there was not something sinister going on in our world I'd much rather believe that this was just odd timing that he drowned except the facts around this case are that he was found in all of his clothes as well as having his wallet in his pocket okay so you would have to believe that he regularly went for a swim in all of his clothes and with his wallets in Puerto Rico after tweeting that he thought that the CIA the Messiah were going to kill him that's what you would have to believe if you wanted to stay on the side of believing that there is not something more Sinister happening that wasn't his only tweet by the way he also tweeted three possible futures for me one suicided by CIA two CIA brain damage slave asset three worst nightmare of people who effed with me up until now I am sure these are the only options he tweeted that on September 4th and um yeah that if I read that tweet and he was still alive I would think that he was just crazy but he's not he is dead he's not the only person in the crypto world as I mentioned earlier that has died there was another man named chan chan colinder 30 years old who died in his sleep last week which is bizarre and there was another one who just died yesterday his name is via shalav Tehran pardon my pronunciation here 53 years old he died after his helicopter plunged near the resort town in Switzerland after taking off from Busan on a clear day they have no understanding of why this helicopter would have crashed there was no weather issues and there was another person that was supposed to get onto the helicopter that last minute decided not to so yeah it is getting a bit strange and I am not sure what is going on I do not believe that all of these people are dying in mysterious circumstances and that they're all just happening upon their deaths accidentally I I'm fearful to even have this discussion you know I think it's a scary idea it's it's scary my brain does not want to believe that they're can be this many pedophiles in power does not want to believe that there can be something sinister happening that our CIA that our intelligent agencies are involved in but I do know that this story scares me and it's important that I bring it to the Forefront and that you know that it is taking place and I will just read your comments and see what you all think about it and that's all I'm going to say about that all right guys Christmas is just around the corner and although the world wants you to focus on presence in Santa let's not lose sight about Christmas is really all about to help you remember the reason for the season hallow invites you to join

some topics to show [Music] okay so obviously I wish that we could just cover happy topics all day long I mean it just it beats me down that this is the depressive state of things today but it is so much more important to me that everybody is informed especially if you're like me and you're a mother to two young children I want to know everything that's going on in the school systems I want to know exactly what to look out for I want to be able to make a decision about where I should live it's the reason I picked up moved my family away from a liberal City because this stuff is real and unfortunately if we don't talk about it they certainly aren't going to when I say they I'm talking about uh the Department of Education your teachers print the principals the teachers are not going to tell you what's going on because the entire point of all of this is to disrupt the family unit we talk about California all the time because it is an actual communist country that happens to be in the United States but its own communist country and I have said to my listeners over and over again move if you live in California move I do not believe that they run a fair election process I believe that Gavin Newsom is a dark character and he is hell-bent on destroying the people of California it's just not worth I I don't believe it's worth the fight there anymore if you have young children and to add weight to that claim thousands of convicted pedophiles in California are now being released from prison less than a year after committing horrific acts horrific Acts including rape sodomy and sexual abuse of kids under 14. so this is actually going on The Daily Mail has been reporting on this and it's more than seven thousand sex offenders who were convicted of lewd acts with the child under 14 of age but were let out of prison the same Europe they were incarcerated data from California Megan's laws Megan's Law database says so I don't know why they're doing this we've obviously been talking a lot about this that we're seeing people that are put into places of power that are making sure the laws are really lenient against pedophiles not just pedophiles also murderers people that commit crime it seems that they are trying to fill the streets with criminals and I am not sure why I cannot understand why other than to want to see chaos and to want terrible things to happen but we are seeing the crime rates keep trucking up in these inner city communities but especially in California the article goes on to say that others who committed some of the worst child sex crimes on the statute books served similarly short sentences including 365 pedophiles convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child who spent less than 12 months in prison 39 cases of sodomy with a child under 16 and three cases of kidnapping a child under 14 with intent to commit lewd acts according to the data former Los Angeles sex crimes prosecutor Samuel door Dooley and Toba daily The Daily Mail that he was shocked by the statistics and he described them as fright inning for society and I think that frightening is the perfect adjective to describe exactly what's going on it's frightening to think that for whatever reason these people are being thrown onto the streets and I just do not understand and honestly comment you guys know I read your comments what would keep somebody tethered if you have a family you have a young family what would keep you Tethered to the inner city communities I understand there's work opportunities but I can't imagine choosing work over the safety of my children especially when there seems to be a government-sponsored incentive to put the Children at Risk whether it's in the classroom whether it's on the streets this is happening the statistics clearly show that pedophiles don't get reformed by the way they're going to come out and they're going to commit again obviously because you have to be far gone I mean so mentally deluded to commit a sex act against a small child a minor child and the fact that these people are being let out and you have all the statistics that are showing that they are likely to commit those same crimes again should have every single person concerned so I just wanted to bring that your attention because I also talk about just aside from the criminals the criminality in Los Angeles uh the crime of even if when you're a parent you have no say over your children's health they have also the state has really squeezed in on that your children cannot go to school even if you homeschool now they get to tell you whether or not you have to vax your child how many vaccines to give them if we're in the state of California so I just do not perceive it as a free state whatsoever and uh unless there is something unbelievable tethering you there it's time to pick up and move uh like I did with my family not away from California but away from inner city communities all right guys I want to take a second to talk to you about Bond charge formerly called Blue blocks they have rebranded and are now called bomb charge and they're a holistic Wellness brand with the huge range of products aimed at

applied at checkout alright guys I want to move on and to discuss Joe Biden's non-binary drag queen nuclear waste Guru in case you missed it you remember the picture the photo of the guy that was wearing heels and I guess he had something to do with um what was that stuff that he was involved in puppy play he would dress up and it was some weird fetish that he had well it doesn't matter because he is working for your tax dollars are going to support him I guess is the best way to say it his name is Sam Britton and his full title is the Doe's Deputy assistant Secretary of the office of spent Fuel and waste disposition and he's now been accused of taking a bag he was caught on camera stealing a bag from minneapolis's airports baggage claim and if he's found guilty he could face five years in jail a ten thousand dollar fine or both and I want to be very clear he's not going to face any of that because Hunter Biden is roaming the streets freely and he's a crackhead he's got pornography on a laptop and so I mean I don't even is the idea that anybody connected to Joe Biden is ever going to be made an example of or that they're ever going to have to face up for their crimes is a long-running joke at this point but if he actually did have to pay for his crimes that's what it would be uh you know this guy as I said proudly announced on LinkedIn that he had become the assistant Secretary of spent Fuel and he's been very in our face but yes they caught him on October 27th taking a bag a navy blue hard sided roller bag from a baggage claimed Carousel and the bag was reported missing by a woman earlier in the day after reviewing a lot of the surveillance videos she was able to identify the bag with a total value of items stolen approximately 2 325 dollars okay so here is why the story is a strange one it's strange because Brenton was in the airport having arrived in a flight from Washington DC but he didn't check a bag so he didn't check a bag so why would he go to baggage claim to collect a bag if he hadn't checked one so law enforcement was were able to quickly track him down and he denied it he completely denied taking anything which is weird because wouldn't you at least oh no I took a bag but it was my bag so that's the mix-up this is this is my bag I need to open and go actually it's only back at all so after denying it then he had a change of heart and he called the airport police and he said okay actually no I I lied a little bit um I wasn't being completely honest I did take a blue bag from the airport again he never checked a bag in so it's completely bizarre then he lies and says he took nothing now he's coming clean and saying okay I did take a bag and it's it's getting a little weird right so now he's saying that he was just a little tired and he took the suitcase thinking that maybe it was his even though he didn't check a bag sounds like he might be a liar and by the way this is a very weird thing how crazy you have to be just going to take a flight right get off of a play now how tired do you have to be to stand at baggage claim okay and think that you checked to wait for a bag that you never checked to take it and then to forget that you took it and lie to law enforcement and take anything and then call them and say oh just kidding I did take something but I'm not I'm not really sure why why I took it this is just weird it's weird it's bizarre paper it's almost like he's crazy and if you didn't think he was crazy because the suitcase thing you should probably think he's crazy because he's got a weird puppy fetish so people usually tell you they have mental disorders early on I would say a red flag is dressing yourself like a puppy on your hands and knees wearing heels to work for the government that might have been a red flag and he's got some other mental issues and one might be another fetish fetish is jumping into carousel eight and grabbing a blue bag and pretending you didn't because you were tired now I know tired I'm a mom okay I've traveled on flights with two toddlers well one toddler and a newborn with absolutely no sleep overseas never once when we landed never once did I go to a baggage carousel after having not checked a bag and taken somebody else's and then forgot I didn't I told the police no it wasn't me so this guy's probably gonna lose his job if things are right in the world but they're not right in the world so he's probably gonna get a promotion from Joe Biden promotion and an astounding defense from Joseph Biden who probably doesn't even know that he works for him moving on you guys I hate to cover her but I'd like to cover her uh today because she's so ridiculously crazy Julia Fox I don't know what on Earth possessed Kanye to date her for what was it two three weeks and now she's writing a book on their romance and now she's come out and she has said you know I only dated him to protect Kim Kardashian because she's like obsessed with the Kardashian family you can definitely tell and so she talks about them on Tick Tock like if those are my girls um she's also just as a side note you can just park this deeply unattractive inside and outside but she's now doing a video trying to explain to you that Hollywood's not weird and Balenciaga thing isn't weird and the problem is men take a listen you guys love saying the like Holly weird all the pedophiles and Holly weird listen up faces there's pedophiles in every industry you want to go be a chef you'll probably have some abusers over there you want to go be a teacher abusers over there you want to go be an engineer abusers over there this isn't an issue with Hollywood this is an issue with the Fashion World this isn't an issue with celebrities this is an issue with man God oh yeah that's totally stable she's a totally stable person you should just believe everything she says and so it's not an issue with Hollywood guys there's pedophiles everywhere if you want to be a chef as she says you should just expect I was literally pedophiles theirs pedophiles making your pasta when you go to the restaurant you should just expect that and the issue isn't the fact that there are sick twisted people in the world the issue is men it's always men which is strange to me because I'm pretty sure the fashion industry isn't exactly run by straight men and I'm pretty sure as we covered yesterday A lot of these photos their main stylist is actually a woman who's involved in some weird satanic stuff and her whole Instagram is littered with references to the devil and blood with babies it was a woman but you know the great thing about being a feminist which is something that Julia fox says that she is is that you never have to take responsibility for anything that is that is the beauty of being a modern feminist no matter what happens no matter what you do no matter if you're staring at something straight in the face and it's so obvious that women have a hand in it all you have to do is say actually it's it's the fault of men so yeah that's all that I have to say about that if you're looking for a meaningful gift for your loved one this year you've got to

from Madeline she writes I bet after the response Kim was like no matter what I do it's not enough obviously this is about Kim Kane Balenciaga well Kim yeah it isn't because you haven't done the right thing you just wrote some letters and hoped that it'll deflate just like AstroWorld did all we wanted was for you to say I'm done with them and the world would have praised you till the end of time that's it if you lost Millions out of the billions that you have everyone was so quick to judge Kanye so quick even Gigi where is she now where is everyone now crickets as Candice said Silence has never been more powerful now not after a vendetta but I truly hope this is the end of the masses worshiping these celebs and Trends balenciaga's apology is embarrassing to save a lease they've addressed only what they wanted not a single thing about all of the other props that were so obnoxious in our face but hey it's fine let's forgive them right people make mistakes bless them no it's so so wrong and if this goes away and people will still be shopping with them in a month or two we do deserve all of this I like the end of that that we do deserve all this so sometimes I wonder because it feels like we present people with all of the facts and then people just do not change their minds like it's so easy to not follow Kim Kardashian it's so easy to not pick up a three thousand dollar bag from Balenciaga following this it's so easy to make an effort to say I draw a line somewhere in that place that I draw a line is pedophilia it's that easy right I draw the line pedophilia so if you are a celebrity and you are pretending that you are processing what happened and you're still going to work with these people I draw a line at you and I I will never purchase any Kardashian products knowingly unless they are have a partial ownership somewhere I'm not aware of it I will not purchase any of their products I'm really I really do think that it is Despicable people we also covered yesterday the assisted suicide ad which was something that I had been very passionate about because it's very obvious to me that they are going to try to glamorize assisted suicide and encourage people with all sorts of mental disorders to Simply kill themselves and because it's already happening it's not something that I'm thinking up it's already happening there have been cited examples of just that of people coming forth and saying I'm not suicidal I'm just in debt and the hospital is encouraging me to kill myself in Canada well miss Mew writes to me as a Canadian and someone who works on an oncology surgical unit in a hospital I agree with made that is the government program in Canada maid for the Termini for the terminally ill no human should ever have to suffer however I don't think that our government should use it to rid our country of its less fortunate or mentally ill population we need better resources to help that group of people my father died of cancer it wasn't nice to witness at all my sister-in-law's mother used our maid program as well as a few of my patients they were suffering and it got them out of their own personal hell it was the best decision for those people as I said uh I believe that the slope is incredibly slippery once you give the hospital that permission and give people that option to be able to kill themselves of course as and as we are seeing it is going to be abused by the government and individuals are going to want those pills to end their lives prematurely and that's good for the government the government doesn't want a burden they don't want a financial burden and as a Christian person I I just cannot get on board with the maid program whatsoever this question remember we covered the Velveeta lawsuit yesterday the woman who was like hey it actually takes longer than it should to make this Velveeta cheese I think on the package it says three minutes and this woman realized it takes a little more so she's now suing the Craft Company well this person writes the lady about the macaroni isn't wrong that it does take longer because it takes four minutes in my microwave but this is not a lawsuit plus it depends on the microwave on how long it takes I have a bad feeling like she's going to win this she won't get all that money but she'll get some and then they'll change the label in some way yeah your bad feeling is probably accurate welcome to America where you can sue for anything and they are probably going to say hey give this ridiculous women a couple thousand dollars to make her go away maybe they'll give her forty thousand dollars or something to make her go away and then they're going to change the packaging because it needs to be cooked I don't know somehow the extra minute really kills people and this woman obviously uh was unable to go on with her activities because it took her four minutes as opposed to three minutes and as I said that that story as funny as it is also offers a very sad commentary on the state of things in our society in terms of the sloth and the laziness that we're suffering from intrinsically last comment is from Crystal Sims it is regarding the Candace merch which you guys can get at yes we candace.com see what I did there haha she writes girl for the sale I got my gray Candace oh sweater truth bomb hoodie and the black yes week Candace

borders we know his position on open borders i'm going to quote him directly on how he feels about national sovereignty he once said quote sovereignty is an anachronistic concept originating in bygone times end quote he also once said that quote the critical issue of our time is how to overcome the obstacles posed by national sovereignty to the pursuit of the common interest end quote sounds like a real communist right we don't it's just unbelievable we don't need we need to aspire toward common interest not individual interests not national interests and this is why people call him a globalist which they're trying to say you can't say anymore because they're trying to make it seem as though globalism is a dirty word it's not okay guys i want to take a moment to talk to you about birch gold

among the people that are seeking to globalize the world this is his perspective on national sovereignty in his own words which is why it's a very relevant story that most people probably didn't pay attention to this week that he funded a group of hispanic investors to buy up dozens of radio stations across america a group of high-profile hispanic investors bought up 18 radio stations across 10 cities in a 60 million deal now what does george soros have a care for wanting to invest in hispanic radio well at the moment we have our border being flooded um every single day we have millions of people that have entered this country even in the last year right illegal immigrants that have come across our border and into this country and what does he want to do he wants to control the media he wants to control what they're hearing in the same way that we talk about the fact that our media is all left-leaning it's very clear that they do not represent the people but they represent corporate interests because they're bankrolled by all of these huge billionaires well that's what he is trying to continue doing but his aim is to talk to hispanic people to make sure as i have said from the very beginning to black america i have said once they begin importing enough illegals over the border they're not going to be concerned about the black vote the black vote will become irrelevant instead they will be focused on the hispanic vote they're going to be giving them this huge victim narrative and telling them that they're the new oppressed group and telling them that they need to bind together and fight for their rights and the government should give them more handouts they'll be focusing on breaking down the hispanic family they'll be focusing on making sure hispanic people in america are atheists and don't believe in anything this is so this is so obviously been coming around the bend and this is just another piece of the puzzle to realize that he is making this investment uh for no other reason than really propaganda because everything that we see around us when you talk about the mainstream media outlets is in fact propaganda so keep an eye on that story it's very important thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new videos to watch or listen to

drop yet uh just because we are watching totalitarianism medical tyranny spread across the world and we know everybody knows by now that something's not right with this story um too many federal governments ngos involved in this and plotting planning you know trying to say this wasn't a leak okay maybe it is a leak take us slowly through exactly what you came across these were documents inside darpa which is a division of the department of defense these documents were provided to us by a source much like the actually buying diary by the way i wonder if they're going to raid me again for publishing stolen documents absurd penta literally pentagon papers that we have uncovered here written by a marine corps major fellow his name is joe murphy joe murphy was not the provider of these documents we reached out to joe murphy for comment and he and he gave us a comment saying there's a lot of good people in the government trying to do the right thing and hopefully more come out these documents show that the gain of function research darpa rejected it the department of defense rejected it on code because it was too dangerous it was too risky in march of 2018 eco health alliance approached darpa with that which seems to contradict anthony fauci's testimony because these documents indicate that uh equal health alliance approached niaid anthony fauci was and they did not reject it so why did the department of defense think it was too risky but then if anthony fauci proceeded with it anyway anthony fauci addressed these documents in congress last week mentioned project veritas by name seemed to authenticate the documents and play kind of a semantical argument under oath yeah and it is semantics because he's like well we didn't fund it who knows maybe they got the funding from someone else and he's saying it wasn't niaid but he's obviously was very much involved in this knew about this gain of function research might be something the public want to know wants to know when you're doing all this public interface and talking about the pandemic and using the stay home and all of these you know essential businesses that are allowed to stay open while small businesses are taken out but i want to show a clip of the project veritas video because it's pretty incredible project veritas has obtained a separate report to the inspector general of the department of defense written by the u.s marine corps major joseph murphy a former darpa fellow major murphy makes claims in his report to the inspector general that if true could be damning to the official narrative that has been played out to the world over the past two years major murphy's report states that eco health alliance approached darpa in march 2018 seeking funding to conduct gain of function research of bat born coronaviruses the proposal was named project diffuse darpa rejected the proposal because the work was too dangerous and could violate the gain of function moratorium despite eco-health's position that it would not according to the documents the niaid under the direction of dr fauci did not reject the proposal they went ahead with the research at wuhan and several sites across the u.s dr fauci has repeatedly maintained his position under oath that the nih and niaid have not been involved in gain of function research with the eco health alliance program this appears to be contradictory to major murphy's analysis and the rejection from the biological technologies office at darpa major murphy's report goes on to detail great concern over the covid19 gain of function program the concealment of documents the suppression of potential curatives like ivermectin and and the mrna vaccines i mean this is just even talking about that the blocking of the treatment that we're seeing such blatant corruption uh seeing as soon as they find out something works the federal government's going oh we have to stop it because we need to we need to save it somehow and make sure that everybody can have access to it but in reality they're just creating barriers and it seems to me that they just want people to die um and then you have klaus schwab which i spoke about in an earlier segment you know releasing a book saying now we've predicted the pandemic the pandemic became true and now here's how we can use it to our advantage um to inspire a global technocracy this is what they want it's so obvious well and these documents were buried on a top secret share drive they're unclassified documents which to me it's it suggests a cover-up and fauci is playing semantical games because the proposal wasn't identical the one from eco health alliance to darpa versus the one to niaid and he's talking about the definition of gain of function so we call upon anthony fouchy to release the proposal the public has a right to know especially in light of these documents i mean dr malone compared them to the pentagon papers i mean millions of people have died many more have suffered so we want anthony fouch to simply be transparent and there's more sources coming to us you know if if dr fauci won't be transparent then project garthos will have to release the documents via other means i hope you are enjoying the show we'll get right back to it in just a second but first when you bring a product into your home you want to be sure that your hard-earned money is going

in congress because he was immediately questioned about this and it's just one of those things where he doesn't want to release anything himself he wants people to have to dig in to look and to me he's just up to his neck in corruption let's roll the clip you funded project diffuse and it's research that took place at the wuhan institute of virology why did you tell the committee that your agency has never funded gain of function research why did your agency award this grant despite it being rejected by darpa due to its concerns about violating the moratorium that was in place and finally will you commit today to release all records fully unredacted by the end of this week so congress and the american people can know the truth about nih's role and the origins of cover 19. so again senator i really pains me to have to just point out to the american public how absolutely incorrect you are what came out last night on project veritas was a grant that was submitted to darpa then it distorted and said we funded the grant we have never seen that grant and we have never funded that grand so once again you are completely and unequivocally incorrect when you joined the darpa proposal was a grant that we never saw and we did not fund but the facts are on my side so why would you not commit to sharing everything open under adapted with this congress and he won't and you're right it's semantics he's basically saying well we didn't fund it but we know that he's in the middle of this whether or not he's the person moving the money not moving the money he has been in the middle of this from the very beginning and if he was being honest why not just share all the documents it would have been a different proposal it would have been from ecohealth to niad not the one to darpa so they play semantical games and this is what i talk about in my new book american muckraker it's up to us it's up to the citizens it's you can't rely upon the new york times or these people to be honest you have to do the work yourself citizens be brave do something whistleblowers out there come to us at project veritas there's many of them out there thanks for joining me on this segment of

"oUN9zUAgrVk": "hello and welcome and you may have noticed that i did not put up a 911 tribute post on social media this year there was something about it but it felt a little bit like fiction it's difficult for me to explain what i mean but i'm going to try to like every single person i remember exactly where i was when the plane hit the first tower i was 12 years old and i was in a middle school music class but more importantly i remember exactly how i felt i felt scared and i felt confused but as the weeks following that day went by that initial fear and confusion migrated into something else into an almost sense of security a real sense of american pride someone shared an old clip of sammy sosa who hit a home run two weeks after 9 11. he drapes himself in an american flag in the clip and he ran around all of the bases that really embodies how i felt that was how we all felt that we were in something together this was in america long before social media we just had tv screens we hung on to newscasters every word and every syllable and every word in every syllable during that time bled red white and blue now it's two decades later and 9 11 still drums up a lot of feelings but when feelings are primary sometimes thinking can become secondary over the weekend i did some thinking i thought about the concept of a sports hero draping themselves in an american flag today that would be almost unimaginable we can't even get athletes to stand for the national anthem not even on foreign soil not even for the olympics i also thought about how my every memory of 9 11 includes a deep reverence for first responders policemen paramedics firefighters doctors nurses our military individuals and people who sacrificed their lives during after and because of the events on that day fast forward to today and i'm looking at joseph biden barack obama and george bush all i can think is this is a farce it feels like a farce the never-ending war on terror american sons and daughters killed because george bush said we needed to avenge the attacks so that joe biden could eventually seize power to the taliban some 20 years and trillions of dollars later question how many americans died in iraq and afghanistan since 2001. answer a lot more than the amount that were killed on september 11th way to avenge our fallen heroes speaking of that war on terror by the way can we define terror because post-9 11 when i was growing up there was this focus on oppressive islamic regimes and cultures the kind of cultures that forced masks they're women they're oppressed women so i really had to appreciate the irony of the imagery of bush biden and obama and clinton all vaccinated by the way standing behind masks but maybe that's because the definition of terror keeps mutating like the coronavirus today the problem isn't radical islam today those same elitists who taught us to fear jihadists are teaching us a new kind of terror the new generation of school children are learning to fear patriots the war on terror has mutated to a war on american patriotism the kind that wave the american flag and what an absolute joke it was to see obama in attendance honoring first responders the man who single-handedly launched a war on police black lives matter america is systemically racist the police force is systemically racist please defund the police in fact all of our first responders are on the brink of losing their jobs if they don't abide by the vaccine decree of dictator biden same for our military roll up your sleeves or get lost how is that for some appreciation when i was 12 i remember feeling like we were all in it together but here's the truth we're not in fact those words make me cringe a little today we were told that we were all in it together but now i think it was always us versus them them using a crisis in the media to make us feel while they work to take away our freedoms the word freedom used to be synonymous with america but you know what it's not anymore hashtag never forget well look around because clearly we've forgotten something maybe the best way to honor the victims is to simply think think deeply about the lessons of that tragic day about how our country has transformed since and why our country has transformed is transformed because we felt we felt scared and so we willingly surrendered many of our civil liberties that we may never get back think about it we passed through the patriot act allegedly to give our government the right to spy on terrorists but nope they never caught a single terrorist that way what they did do however was abused the authority given to them by spying on ordinary americans that's why edward snowden you'll recall is a wanted man who is now forced to live abroad in russia because he told us the truth about our government which makes me think who are the real beneficiaries of 911 not the taliban certainly not us the american people perhaps the american government which has grown itself exponentially over these last 20 years the dhs didn't even exist now it's 184 000 plus employees the tsa another one didn't exist can't even fathom just walking onto a plane these days without being frisked forced to take off your shoes your belt everything yeah around 55 000 more employees there so yes let's hashtag never forget the deeper truer lesson of september 11th it's a lesson about government it's a lesson about tyranny it's a lesson about how when a government wants you to acquiesce to tyranny they need fear they need uncertainty they need a crisis that inspires both then they can suspend civil liberties then decades later they can stand up on a stage behind cloth masks to commerce to commemorate to honor to remind the people that they rule over why it was necessary for them to suspend your liberties in the first place and if you have any questions about that it's because you you're the new kind of terrorist i can say truly from the bottom of my heart that i am so grateful to every single person every first responder police officer firefighter doctor nurse fallen true to every hero that sacrificed into the many that continue to sacrifice because of the events that took place on that horrible tragic day but also from the bottom of my stomach i just cannot with these people that are at the forefront of our country i refuse to play pretend with those masked villains i want to talk to you about your internet security does it make sense at the same company who controls half of online retail also passively eavesdrops on your private conversations at home every site you visit every video you watch or message you send gets tracked and data mined but when you run expressvpn on your device the software hides your ip address making

on bet we are actually going to watch the full trailer because it's incredible it deserves to be played in its entirety it's called karen parents boy baby you just gotta give it a chance [Music] tell me about your new neighbors they're black that's mine keeping it down if you don't comply i'll tell the manager i might have taken home security serious hi i am karen drexler i'm your neighbor you need to be taking your trash cans off the curb right when the trash is picked up is she nice yeah she's nice wait a minute we have a white entitled neighbor named karen karen okay enjoy yourself there she is slaving away in the kitchen i've come across some very suspecting teenagers can you please hurry up please and see they're very aggressive yep i left my wallet with my id at home leave a alone we didn't do anything how the heck did you end up moving to this neighborhood next thing you know we have criminals you take care of him and i will take care of her would you mind stepping out of the car my office has uncovered some disturbing information on her and her brother she doesn't like black people we have a search warrant well i'm black i know she doesn't like me i want to sell the house you can't tell me huh we are living next door to a races you went in her house you wouldn't want your wife to know our little secret right i was not standing police procedure back there what do we have here we got a hammer everything looks like nails you people are very angry shut your mouth bad things happen to people that don't comply oh i just want to be very clear because i know people are watching that going that looks like an amy polar saturday night live skit and it's mostly funny no this is actually a true horror film that is coming out this is not a joke in any way shape or form in fact taryn manning herself confirmed that and i just want to just actually watch a clip of her confirming this in an interview that she's the one who's playing the actress and why she believes this film is really important after seeing how people have rightfully vilified these cairns to step into that role is a pretty bold move on your part yes i'm taking on this role i love the material um first and foremost you know it's about the writing and then i adore coke and i think that he really cares and he's ready for change it felt like a social responsibility i mean even though i'm playing opposing you know the opposing side if i have to you know sort of play the villain and do all that to help make change on the globe i was more than willing to step into the role so this is a socially responsible film i actually don't even know where to start so i'm just going to let you guys talk at me all the last i started off i started for the love of god this is not real life i stay around number white people and no no white woman has come to my house and got mad at me for living in the nobody cares i i get sick of them painting black people as these victims they we either slaves in movies or we somehow victim to white people worried about where we live in it it kills me it balls my blood that in 2021 they're acting like this stuff still persists i can't find a white person that cares who's living next door and just because they're black they're going to call the police and now the police are involved in it harassing black people where is this happening in america so what's actually happening is a film like this is actually harassing white people right so this is a blatantly racist film right this is this would be akin to white people making a film called shanika and and and letting it define every stereotype of what it means to be a black person right like you know bumping music loud going down the street i mean this is this is painfully racist not even that but they're incorporating this idea that being white is violent right like being white is a form of violence and they're taking it to that next step despite all evidence the contrary like if you really wanted to look at shootings racial you know the racial disparity in terms of shootings if you wanted to you know like say i'm looking at the statistics and i want to draw some conclusions those questions wouldn't be right the conclusion would be from actual statistics that black people are more violent towards white people but they ignore all of that because what's culturally relevant right now is pretending it's the other way around excuse me police black people just moved into my neighborhood what am i supposed to do you've never done that i mean that's all white people do right you know oh my god yeah yeah i just called the police before i came on the show yeah i have my confederate lotion dispenser it's absolutely ridiculous when the left can't find real racism they create racism out of nothing exactly if they had real stories to tell if they had real things to talk about they wouldn't have to create this stupid movie with hollywood actresses they could actually say something that is culturally relevant and going on but no they have to create lies to push their narrative well do you this seems to me to date back to that jordan peel movie get out do you guys remember i actually kind of liked that movie i should say at the outset but it inaugurated this genre right social horror and there's a there's a show on on amazon right now called them which is almost as bad as karen i mean it's one degree away and this is the sort of thing that you would do if you had a government that wanted to create propaganda to stoke a race right right this is what if you were just sitting in your ivory tower and thinking how am i going to drive americans at one another's throats so that once again we can federalize the police force and enforce wokeness at the national level right this is what you would make you would make this stuff because as you say of course like all their ideas are lies they have to invent ways to try to like hypnotize you into believing them and this is like pravda 101. it's just plastic what does this do this tells black people moving into neighborhoods that are maybe more white that oh you can't move into this neighborhood because you're going to be assaulted or someone's going to be racist towards you it's like it's creating segregation itself because it tells black people that they can't move into these neighborhoods because if you do you're going to be ostracized by the other people it's a horrible message to send to people and to candace's point i mean let's keep it real let's make let's make one call tyrone latrell or somebody and then they doing drive-bys every day and walking around with their pants sagging and selling drugs i mean if you want to put these stereotypes let's do it on both sides but it it's crazy that they're doing this because it does create this in young people i mean when i was growing up i believed that white people hated me i did and this is reinforcing that stuff so when you make money or you grow up and get out of the hood and you go live in a nice neighborhood that happen to be white people live in it you're going to perceive them like this you're going to think that your neighbors even though they just wave at you and say hi you're going to think that they have they're out to get you and it creates this residual effect of people hating each other and projecting racism on each other when it's not even happening exactly right and then it also makes it impossible for people to have normal correspondences without racializing the corresponds to their own head like everybody goes through things that are just not fun like you know you get caught off you get cut off when you're driving and somebody flips you the finger well now if you're a black person and that happens between a white you know but you and a white person you go oh that's because i'm black and it's like no that's because it happens to everyone i mean my husband had this story where he was talking to one of his friends um who said you know he's mixed and he you know looks like he's half black half white because that's what he is and he said well you know as a black person there's been so many times where i've been at a club or stepped outside and someone tried to hand me the keys uh as if i was the ballet valet and my husband said back to him do you know that also happens to me like it's so like you're almost training people to see racism where it's not you know we have bad correspondences because we're human beings and you're not going to like every person it's not going to be a good correspondence but now you're training people to believe that every time you have a correspondence with a white person it's because they're being a karen right every bad correspondent the black person is because they're being a shaniqua this is literally racism and it's being taught and it is a propagandist effort", "fQGg_vlGtgo": "in these last couple of years we have seen more radical reform from our government than ever before and not just from our government but particularly from big tech wow you can't just say things on the internet anymore because for your safety they need to make sure that they know what you're reading on the internet especially saw this uh with the covet 19 censorship now you see all these things false information missing context so now blurring images on the internet because you at home are not smart enough to discern between fact and fiction anymore you need us big tech you have to tell you what's true and what's not true so i'm going to remove this post for your safety that's what they're telling us in fact one of the biggest stories ever obviously i think we'll look back on it and it'll be the shot heard around the world was when they censored a sitting president president donald j trump got censored from the internet completely facebook even spotify i don't is he making music they said he's no longer allowed to even have an account on spotify it's for your safety you cannot hear from your president the person you elected the person that you elected to protect you and to tell you the truth got censored from the internet for your safety and none of it really made sense when they did it by the way i have i want to read to you what his final tweet was that was so dangerous that they needed to remove him from the internet for your safety ready he wrote the 75 million great american patriots who voted for me america first and make america great again will have a giant voice long into the future they will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way shape or form exclamation point exclamation point exclamation point apparently three exclamation points is dangerous so they said goodbye they got rid of him that should terrify every single person in the world if a sitting united states president is being censored what's going to happen to us how are we safe if he's not safe right now they're trying to tell us that they need to think for us that what they're doing at all times of the day is that they're just fighting misinformation they're going to tell you what to think they're going to tell you how to think and you're not allowed to ask any questions or ask you're going to risk being censored by yourself you yourself will get censored it's a crazy time in this country i'm going to say something and i i say this and i mean this i don't feel today that america is a free country i'm going to ask that question later in the show to president trump i'm going to ask him whether or not he believes that america is still a free country i don't even know who the government is anymore i don't know if big tech is the government i don't know if apple is the government i don't understand how we have gotten into this predicament in this country i don't know what it's going to take to change things because once we allow the government or any system to trample over our civil liberties we rarely if ever get those civil liberties back ronald reagan once said that the nine most terrifying words in the english dictionary are i'm from the government and i'm here to help

think the frustration on the republican side and this is why i said i want to talk about republican frustrations is that we see the corruption right it doesn't seem like anybody ever pays for the corruption and right now we're seeing corruption live even in terms of big pharma which is a huge topic on the minds of mothers especially you're seeing what's happening at these school board meetings where do you stand on these vaccine mayonnaise and obviously i know that you are you are pro-vaccine obviously you did everything you could to get this vaccine out i know it was one of the greatest achievements we did it in less than nine months to be able to do that but where but now it's taken a twist right it's gotten now we went from this is a good thing and people should have this option to military men you're going to have to resign because you're not getting this vaccine where do you stand on that well i stand on forget about the mandates that people have to have their freedom but at the same time the vaccine is one of the greatest achievements of mankind we would have had a 1917 remember the spanish flu killed perhaps 100 million people actually it ended the first world war because the soldiers were a lot of people don't know that the soldiers got so sick it was a terrible thing there was no vaccines it would know anything i came up with a vaccine with three vaccines all are very very good came up with three of them in less than nine months it was supposed to take five to twelve years and yeah people have died under cobit this year by the way under joe biden then under you and more people took the vaccine this year so people are questioning how the vaccine work but some people aren't taking the ones the ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don't take the vaccine but it's still their choice and if you take the vaccine you're protected look the results of the vaccine are very good and if you do get it it's a very minor form people aren't dying when they take their vaccines about the masking of children that's that's a big one terrible thing i think it's a terrible thing that flies in the face of science the kids have a virtual zero percent chance of dying of cobit and yet they're insisting on these vaccine mandates i mean i'm sorry on these um masking mandates and now the even the vaccine mandates for small children and what's going on there i think what's happening is you look at the masks where fauci and a lot of other people said mass don't mean anything all of a sudden he becomes a radical massacre i don't

it yeah i'm glad to hear that i'm really glad to hear that um and i think that your supporters will be really glad to hear that because no one really kind of got a clear understanding of hey i think vaccine's great but you know people should have a right to i'm so proud of what we did with a vaccine but it shouldn't be mandated and it just shouldn't be and you know the other thing is a lot of people that get it you had it you had it did you get covered uh no you didn't get it doesn't like me i don't i did you have the vaccine no it doesn't matter and i've been all around the world i don't know i don't i think they should study they should study me they're afraid it doesn't like me it's it's a scary thing but it's it's afraid of you my husband had it though yeah but now your husband is now essentially immunity he's got a protection they won't give no they won't give credit to people that had it that aren't going to catch it a second time you know it's a very strong form of immunity so it's it they're crazy well here's ago here talk about corruption i mean you're a businessman imagine i make a product and then you mandate that every single person has to buy my product and this is why people are wondering you know is there a little bit of corruption going on here well this is worse because it's going into your system right you know so this isn't just a product this is a product that's going into your system and some people don't agree with it and some people have religious problems and they have a lot of other things you've always respected the right i totally do and i totally respect somebody saying we don't want to take it and we have a massive you know we will soon have a massive amount of immunity including the people that got it but the mandates are killing our economy you know if you look about what's going on with our economy and jobs where the jobs are so few right now i mean the numbers are terrible because a lot of people can't go to work they don't want to go to work they can't they can't because people won't take them because of the mandate no the mandate's bad for a lot about the military i mean can you imagine where these are these are great individuals and they're leaving we should never i feel like our country is being left defenseless scary very bad thing now it's changing i'll tell you i've never seen anything like the last week or so they're saying all right we're going to take the mandates off you know it's very interesting because they're losing all of these incredible people that they're just not willing to do the work and now you have to understand i'm a big fan of the vaccine i'm not going to give that up that's a great achievement that's so millions and millions of lives i saved okay you know it's very interesting where biden said anybody that lost that many lives should resign well now he's lost more lives so it's very his statement was sort of an incredible statement", "Ik3zkIcaXso": "okay guys you know that

expressvpn.com candice to learn more hello and welcome i'd like to start today by asking you a very serious question what do you know about human psychology i'm asking this question for a very specific and a very important reason the other day somebody mentioned to me that people like stalin and mussolini they tortured and killed millions of people but the more fascinating element of that is that millions more people were okay with it they sanctioned it they had no issue with what these leaders were doing they somehow convinced and deluded the masses to be okay with the fact that they were torturing and killing millions of other people in their society you might be thinking that's a horrible thing that's a horrible component of history but that could never happen today which begs the question how does it happen the answer to that question is that it happens through a process of dehumanization in 2011 the npr ran an article entitled less than human the psychology of cruelty i stumbled upon this article this weekend and it was really fascinating it talked about how it's important that we define recognize and quote describe dehumanization because it's what opens the door for cruelty and genocide the article then goes back and it gives you a brief history of all of the times especially during the rwandan genocide when the two seas were referred to as cockroaches that's a form of dehumanization during the holocaust the nazis referred to jewish people as rats it's another form of dehumanization in fact all throughout history in ancient chinese egyptian and mesopotamian literature there are repeated references to enemies of the empire as sub-human creatures because what has to happen before the mass affliction of any atrocity is the treatment of individuals a sub-human i'm bringing this up because right now in this country in america conservatives are being dehumanized i'm going to say that again conservatives right now in the united states of america are being dehumanized that is not up for debate over the weekend on twitter i saw hashtag maggots trending maggots dispelled m-a-g-a-t-s obviously a play off of mega conservatives that support trump are now being called maggots and that trend is allowed on twitter we've increasingly seen more radical calls for conservatives to be completely censored and removed from the internet like of course most famously the sitting president of the united states at the time donald trump because we're not just maggots we're also dangerous so we have to be made to go away we're not allowed to be on the internet if you're paying attention right now you will also be noticing that the media is being very careful to draw an intentional and very false correlation between conservatives and the pandemic there have been tons of headlines and discussions saying that conservatives are the least likely to get vaccinated trump supporters of course trump supporters are the least likely to get vaccine and that is why this pandemic is not ending they're unvaccinated maggots cdc said this weekend this is now a pandemic of the unvaccinated the idea is to make millions of people believe that conservatives are vermin and of course vermin has to be dealt with right that is why the biden regime is stepping to the plate to deal with us biden's government like all evil regimes before it is doing the population a favor they're conquering misinformation guys they're dealing with the vermin they're going to control the flow of information in other words they're going to brain wash the masses the first step is censorship we don't deserve platforms we're conservatives we're predators remember we can't possibly be online you shouldn't possibly be listening to any conservative voices you need the government to do you a favor and deal with us predators that's the idea right the article also brings up another very important point it states that when people dehumanize others they actually conceive them as sub-human creatures because only then can they begin the process to quote liberate aggression and exclude the target of aggression from the moral community that's what the biden administration is up to right now they're protecting the quote-unquote moral community my question is what happens next all i've got today is that question i want you to think very carefully about the

western washington university has implemented a segregated black only student housing they are referring to this as affinity housing just so you guys know and i don't want you to be confused it's not like segregation of days past this is different because it's exactly like segregation of days past um so i will just turn to the panel to tell me why maybe i'm missing something and this is good and this is woke and it's progressive this is awful i mean the entire purpose of higher education is by the time you get to college if you haven't been around people who might look different than you you need to at least be able to interact people on a normal individual basis as opposed to through all this identity politics prism that we're i think totally lost in i think the twin pillars of the democratic party that are destroying this country right now are identity politics and cancel culture and to me the idea that we are in any way making the world better by insisting that people only surround themselves by people who think and look like them is everything that we fought against in the days of segregation and we don't seem to understand that as matthew mcconaughey said back in true detective time is a flat circle and we're right back where we were often times the 1950s before we continue let's talk about protecting your retirement inflation is already running hot and now the dems are pushing through another massive spending plan of 3.5 trillion dollars so here's the deal if you think money grows on trees like our government does then just keep living in ignorance but if

your savings today what do you think delano so i mean i'm i'm pretty familiar with affinity housing i read the story it seemed like they have a floor in a particular dorm it's one of those things where it's not necessarily the issue it's how it's being used i think right now in america everything that we see is about separation and i fear we're moving to a place of rapid tribalism um so when i read it i said okay i've been to college i'm familiar with these types of things what do you mean you're familiar with these types sorry to cut you off what do you mean you're familiar with these types of things in terms of affinity housing oh have you seen this in your college campus that's why i'm interested not mine necessarily typically what happens is that they'll have affinity housing off campus so they may have a house named for someone and that house may be you know typically reserved for instance let's say for black women uh or you know some some other ethnic minority so so i'm not again it's not totally abnormal to me but i think in this day and age the notion that black students need to live in on a dorm that is culturally affirming whatever that means to you know whoever's running the university is one in many respects that i find offensive because what it's telling me is that they think that black students are too soft too weak and too fragile um to be part of the broader university campus and one of the hardest things in this world and you all know this is to maintain unity whether it's in your marriage whether it's in the church yes whether it's your um a sports dynasty a music group or a country and as i said i fear we're moving to rapid tribalism so these types of things i don't think uh help we will be back to the show in just a moment but first we need to talk about how you can be saving a lot of money on your phone bill customers are abandoning verizon at t and t-mobile's overpriced wireless plans hundreds of thousands of smart

simply smarter wireless what was the point of like the whole civil rights fight if you now have people that have gone so woke right you're so progressive you're aggressive right just like you said the perfect circle you're so progressive that now you're choosing to segregate yourselves like this is to me like sort of the machiavellian scheme of democrat party where they've realized you know we can actually educate people so much that they're going to do what we wanted to do from the very beginning like the democrats were the party of segregation they were the party that wanted all this division and they've somehow convinced people through these the watered-down academics through things like critical race theory the 1619 project teaching kids that you know what you need actually is safe space we're such horrible people that you need a safe space and then you have people that don't recognize this in the black community who are going yeah that's it this is good we are we're choosing to accept this safe space and uh no i was going to say the only way it ends is with an ass kicking in a presidential election right i mean that's and and candace and delano this is why i'm so fired up about 2020 is if covet doesn't happen then donald trump would have destroyed i really believe this i think his ultimate legacy would have been that he destroys identity politics and cancel culture because the democrats would have realized that they can't win elections running on this and they took the lesson of 2020 when they changed all the rules and covid upset the apple card of expectations as a validation of that strategy and i think 2024 has to be utter destruction for the democrats for them to recognize that slicing and dicing us all up based on what we look like is not what america

were saying about the cia having having done that because i have studied that a lot i'm very interested in that i'm actually i've always been very interested in psychology it's probably because from the time i was a kid i just it was a survival skill i got to know who's trying to manipulate you to do what yeah um and i love it i think psychology is really interesting because the human brain is quite fragile it's quite fragile in a way it's um appreciate our children in our children especially which is why i'm so adamantly opposed when children start being targeted and it's not unlike a computer you can program it it is exactly like computer you can program a mind one way or the other and so what you were saying first and foremost about everything that happened to me instantly i by my gut instinct i was the first person to spoke out and said uh something's not right here was if you had applied what the government was doing to its citizens to a relationship between a man and a woman you would have said these are obviously signs of psychological abuse right if a man said to a woman you need to stay at home you can't see your family you can't see your friends you need to stay here because you're going to die i'm the only person that can save you you know every it's terrible out there exactly right any normal human being would just go this is your an abusive relationship some this is very bad you gotta get out of there and then finally the person says okay well you you can leave the house you know you leave the house but here's what you gotta do to leave the house you would say you're you're being abused and that you were your your mind has been it's almost in stockholm syndrome and they go okay well then he's saving me now all i've got to do is do this and i can and i can leave the house this is an example of stockholm systems it's a fantastic metaphor and yet people couldn't understand that you've just entered in a psychologically abusive relationship with your government right you are an abused person right now you're coming out in a fragile state because you've been abused and locked down and they now know that all they're promising you all you got to do is do this and it'll it'll be better all you gotta do is do this one thing and it'll be better and so it was weird to me to see people accept that", "skaDaalOQcw": "it feels that america is sort of inching closer and closer to this sort of idea of persecution i was saying in an earlier episode that we have this sort of ever expanding definition of terrorism when i was a kid it meant islamic radical terrorism after 9 11. and now the focus seems to be on the american people it starts as trump supporters right january 6 people they're terrorists now we've moved on and it's it's parents parents are now you know falling under the bubble of domestic terrorists and i'm wondering this is this is not a very good sign for america when they start looking at the people who are resisting uh what's going on that they see to be wrong seems to be unfair seem to be unjust and they just keep being categorized by our department of justice as domestic terrorists i chose this nation 13 years ago i'm a legal immigrant to the united states and as the child of those that suffered under communism for the longest time i had issues with my fellow americans saying the socialists are coming the communists are coming because you know my dad until his dying day had the scars of the torturers on his wrists when they hanged him from the roof of the torture chamber so i said guys slow down a bit today i don't have any qualms with that this is full-blown communism right when you see mothers who don't want their children to be taught literal bigotry in the schools don't want their children to be marked eight hours a day you said it in your monologue it's not it's zero i've looked it up 0.05 percent mortality rate for children and i walk past this beautiful playground every morning as i'm walking my dogs and i see healthy parents holding the hand of that little toddler with a mask on it face on its face that's that's not about health just look at the figures it's about control so yes when when we are using domestic terrorism labels for people because they wear a red naga hat or they disagree with biden and his his lackeys america is in trouble candice i totally agree and i think you know when i see that when i see a toddler in their mass i think in a sane world we would be acknowledging that this is child abuse when i see a you know a child um who is being forced to go into a restroom that they are uncomfortable with and then we learn that that that child teenager you know was raped molested um in in a restroom and yet you have administrators fighting for that circumstance to potentially be allowed to happen again and lying about what happened covering it up covering it up i live in virginia twice covering up the superintendent the board's saying no such instances occurred in the restrooms in our schools when they knew they knew and at the end of the day when you see brave mothers holding up these images that we couldn't even show on this program of pedophilic pornography in graphic novels that are in the school libraries that's a felony i'm sorry i mean there's laws against putting that material in front of children but this was approved at every level of local government so that's my question why aren't the teachers like i can't believe that teachers are evil right that every teacher like is evil and is a part of this ecosystem i went to school with these teachers a lot of these teachers i should say you know what i mean i went to school with some of these people they off these are not bad people so are they scared are the teachers scared is the ecosystem at the government level and the teachers are terrified to lose their jobs like what's going on that this is so widespread what we are witnessing today isn't a function of something that happened nine months ago it's not something that happened under obama this is the sour bitter fruit of 90 years of preparation there is no conspiracy theory you can look up the names of people like antonio gramsci sololinsky marcus these are people who realized that a communist revolution as happened in russia or china cannot happen in a stable nation that has judeo-christian principles and a solid robust middle class instead of having a violent revolution like in russia or china what you have to do is the long march through the institutions is the phrase you take over the culture you embed yourself in government now not every teacher is evil but if you look at what teachers are being taught in the teacher training colleges if you look at the materials you know terry mcauliffe is a crt is a dog whistle i can show you the virginia educational department's listing of ibrahim kendi of critical race theory this is how we will teach it in virginia schools that doesn't happen by accident and what did we conservatives do for 40 years we kind of lurched for the snooze button we fell asleep we said well you know we're gonna make money that's okay but we don't need to protect our values through hollywood through media when today we have what we have everything except you know your show and talk radio that's about it we've got the daily wire and talk radio that that belong to conservative values breitbart and the rest hates america america is the problem america is racist america is heteronormative cisgender it's it's toxic masculinity you don't need a big conspiracy theory these people hate america that's the problem we'll get back to the show in a moment but first i need to talk to you about where you are buying your meat since 2015 over 100 000 independent

they didn't find success in america and when i look at some of these programs that students are ranking up hundreds of thousands of debt to go into you know majoring in women's studies you know feminism 101 and they get out of school and they realize wait a second i've just been taking lgbt studies for four years i've got all this debt and i can't get a job and i think that that creates a natural resentment towards america because you go i did everything right i went to school i took out loans you sort of get this natural resentment and that's sort of what the government wants right they want them to come out and realize all i can do is really rely on government so either enter the system that i just came out of um or or storm the streets like an antifa uh mobster and say the system needs to be burned down and i think that's a more sinister plan that perhaps the government has going on right now as well as one more ingredient and that's perhaps the most sobering conclusion we can draw after the two last two years i don't care what your pet issue is whether it's the first amendment i'm a big gun guy the second amendment whether it's sanctity of life stopping this genocide of the unborn the biggest problem we have is a unitary one covid has taught us that we have a lack of courage in this nation the likes of which we have never seen before remember that this country in its founding went up against the most powerful empire the world had ever seen the british empire literally the sun did not set on the british empire bigger than the greek the roman the persian less than three percent of the people who lived here went up against that dictatorial force and won in the last two years what have we witnessed candace we've seen maybe a bar owner in new jersey uh a restaurant owner in california these odd stories of people resisting it should have been tens of thousands of people who said no you're not shutting down my livelihood you're not shutting down my capacity not only to feed my children but for my employees to feed my children this is what america has to find again thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video

and i had filled out the forms and when i got to the counter i told her i'm here to see dj ferguson the person behind the counter looked him up and she said do you mean david ferguson and she was right of course dj is a nickname his first name is david i said yes that's the one she then looked at his file whatever was coming up on her screen and immediately went to get a supervisor the supervisor came over looked at the computer looked right up at me and said he's not at this hospital i instantly said well you just told me his name so clearly she was able to find him in the database and then she asked me do you have his floor number and so i called heather and she gave me the floor number then she asked me if i had his exact room number heather at that point said this is ridiculous they've never asked me any of these questions but she supplied the room number the woman then came back and looked right at me and said i'm sorry he is not available to be seen he is not at this hospital long story short what ended up having to happen after about 30 plus minutes was that dj himself despite having just had open heart surgery had to contact the nurses on his floor and demand that they allow me upstairs and eventually they did eventually i got to sit down one on one with david ferguson also known as dj and here's what he had to say for himself basically the brigham one of the members of the brigham board came in and said that there will be no exception now there's no way that they'll revert their decision on this because your opinion on it and they're not even really looking at the medical facts of it so they're just basically basically um he was like no one's getting medical resen you know exemptions um they're not exempting anybody from not taking the vaccine you have i mean i think you're probably one of the bravest people because talk about them trying to control and get people to do something you seem like the perfect candidate that they could just say listen buddy it's this or that what is keeping you fighting against this when you morally don't feel like you you don't feel comfortable with this medical decision well first and foremost i

expecting you know to suddenly be everyone in the world is talking about you and debating this and having journalists write op-eds they're very important no self-important op-eds like how are you how are you handling all this how are you hanging in there and just fighting honestly i uh we'll see my family you know heather you you saw how awesome there was yeah um kids the new one you know a baby on the way david boy um the dream of having a farm and you know just doing my own thing i've been a pretty self-sufficient guy my whole life and uh i've dealt with adversity a lot um and i seem to overcome it well from my experience um and i just i just didn't want to keep to the pressure of the big hospital you know yeah so i knew they were going to push it on me before i even got here your dad said something he said it was actually so perfect he said you know my my son's heart could change the world you know and i think that when i was following the story and seeing the impact it's made and one of the things that's been really beautiful is that it's kind of crossed the political barrier where people whether they're left or right or saying hey man what are we even talking about that could be my kid that could be my son that could be my husband and that that's incredibly impactful what do you hope that your children learn from this um i just i hope they learn um just like we were saying earlier i hope they learn to stick to their guns and don't collapse to either bullying or you know deception stuff like that and teach them what's right and what's wrong yeah you know it's everything's getting skewed nowadays and it's sometimes it's hard to read through the fog but if they ever need advice you know i'm gonna be there to tell them what's right and what's wrong all right exactly well i'm gonna end this here and i'm gonna thank you so much for taking the time to do this in closing i hope that revealing these stories to you has showed you that this is not a political

suddenly appear in our society rapidly over the last five years I didn't go to school with any people that thought they were male or thought they were female right we just had gays and lesbians and

years what's your take on this i'm still shocked that people ever took black lives matter seriously i mean all of all of the people that they jump on board to support not the children in the communities that are getting gunned down in drive-by shootings or any reasonable black people that may be experiencing adversities in our country they only jump on a bandwagon of criminals or people who have been shot by police officers and many of them justified that is blowing my mind that people aren't coming out in a major way to disavow them when they had to like the black boxes on their instagram they should be coming out now and taking a responsibility to say we need black lives matter be held accountable right i personally feel like all of those celebrities and all of those influencers posting those squares and you know no posting for a week we're going to be silence because you know every words are violent and the next week silence is silence is violence i think that those celebrities and influencers who peddled and pushed this stuff for months all summer long i think they need to be held accountable i think they need to apologize to their followers i mean even though i'm married to a black man i was called a racist you know all year long for saying well maybe we should check out blm um you know maybe maybe they're a little you know they're marxist they don't they want the man out of the family you know maybe we should look into it before we give them money or support them and it was like you're racist everything is your racist so i think that it's like to me this is the biggest duh of course we told you so but i think that all of those celebrities and all of those influencers who were pushing the stuff pushing the stuff and if you don't support it you're racist they all need to apologize and they all need to be held accountable like i'm so sick of that narrative if you don't post a black square and if you don't regurgitate what the phrase of the week is you're a racist or a xenophobe or a homophobe like i'm so sick of it these people when they're proven wrong need to be held accountable inflation is out of control and we see that more

they're like how dare you spread russian propaganda and i'm like i got this directly from your website here's the link that was amazing so you posted the emails right yeah and i was just laughing because that's that happens so often they're like why are you spreading russian disinformation you wrote it i mean politico reported that ukrainians helped the clintons in the 2016 election that they were interfering in some way and then a few years later they wrote that was a conspiracy theory and they never retracted their original article right and so so i have no problem saying i don't trust you as the mainstream media and i want you as you i won't use you as a source if you're complaining about this information you published being russian disinformation right i mean i i so agree what what is your take on the russian ukraine debacle oh this is complicated i would i would advise everybody to look up the qatar turkey pipeline this goes way back involves syria it involves joe biden his son there's other former uh you know alphabet agencies involved in this i think the the bigger picture is russia controls a large amount of natural gas going into europe we know that now especially with the gas prices fuel prices nordstrom 2 is another piece of that but they have something a company called gazprom that goes through ukraine it was reported i think in 2012 by the guardian whether you trust them or not i don't know that the u.s wanted to they wanted to invade syria because bashar al-assad wasn't allowing qatar to build its pipeline through turkey through syria through turkey into europe to offset russia's gas monopoly or large large control so bashar al-assad explicitly told the u.s i will not allow this pipeline because it will interfere with my ally russia well then the whole region destabilizes isis happens the u.s wants to get rid of assad i think all of this is related that keeps happening every time we have an interest in a region suddenly we there's a war in the region but it's never about the interests it's about suffering people that we need to get behind and i've been communicating this to my audiences is that like we have to eventually and i really do mean this as like a collective consciousness wake up to this because they're not even trying new strategies anymore i mean this is happening over and over again you see they have an interest wars are not about people these are these are about government interests and i've been communicating that and of course as soon as you say something like that and it goes away from the narrative which is very cookie cutter and very easy russia bad ukraine goods the lenski hero putin bad and you dig deeper people are almost like not ready and i wonder if there's an element of that that's just like i'm not ready to accept that government's gonna be described i'm not ready to think about the fact that i potentially sent my son overseas to die for something as stupid as this like what is it that is stopping the masses from understanding these sort of deeper rules behind what's shaping all of these wars across the world not even the wars i mean i i don't really know because i ask myself this every day with covet stuff i mean how many times does the news have to contradict contradict itself how many stories have to come out that are fake until you finally say hey maybe maybe something's not right here as it pertains to donald trump i didn't vote for him in 2016. but what did we get under trump isis was crushed so the region is stabilizing the abraham accords peace in the middle east starting to form and he was the bad guy and the economy was doing really really well now a year on the i i just it scares me that there are so many people in this country that can see the media lie about let's just say cal rittenhouse that was a lie um george floyd was grossly misinterpreted the footage comes out the whole story is different the covington kids they smear that was a lie russia gay trump colluded with russia years of lying ukraine gate trump they say that trump was trying to leverage ukraine to go after his political rival joe biden when joe biden wasn't even running for president and now if you look at all the data especially the reporting from matt taibi it just looks like joe biden actually was corrupt and what donald trump i think donald trump stumbled upon this corruption story on accident and he was just like hey take a look into this so they lie about it and they went insane and then they wanted him to be impeached it was like don't even look at ukraine don't even talk about ukraine we're going to impeach you for a phone call and people aren't piecing the story like what are the chances that where your president you know has interest barisma you know igor kolomoisky i've been talking about this like guys igor kolomoisky he funded the president zielinski into power he funded his show he's also up you know the controlling interests of barisma this is more complicated but people are not looking there right the media it's fascinating to me that the news will come out report something like i was mentioning with techcrunch then come out a week later oh no that was fake news they'll come to you and say you're spreading disinformation and it's their own reporting right people believe it it's like it's like people have amnesia or or maybe there's just a divide happening where there are people who are paying attention they'll hear what you say and they'll say candace is correct here because she just said

topics they want me to post something about black lives matter and to be honest i'm not an expert on race relations in america i just want to be pretty on the internet that's what she said i just want to be pretty on the internet and i said that is so refreshing for a model to admit that they don't know what they're talking about and that they don't want to be an expert about everything i actually missed those days i missed those days when people were comfortable saying i don't know my story is interesting i actually got into politics because i hate politics i especially hate politicians because it's this weird culture of pretending to know absolutely everything i have done so many political events where i've stood up on stage to someone they've received a question they clearly didn't know the answer to the question but they just you know pretended to because i'm in politics i have to know everything i have to take a stance on absolutely everything now it feels like that political culture has seeped down into every average individual across the entire world they feel like they have to pretend they know about various topics so you're going to have to imagine my surprise this weekend when i went to check out some of the direct messages that i received and they were regarding the israel and palestinian conflict that broke out people actually began messaging me i don't think i'm really known as a middle eastern expert but here are just a couple of the private messages that i received ready candace i have followed you for years i don't understand how you can see an image like this the image that they were referring to as an image of a dead arab girl and not use your platform to speak out have you sold out have you sold out now because you work for ben shapiro another message i received candace you need to draw attention to the jewish people that are being attacked all over the country i don't understand how you have not said anything at all your silence is violence silence is violence i would tell you that both of these messages really upset me because what they're really doing there is emotional blackmail it's either do this or you are that it's exactly what was done during the black lives matter riots if you did not use your platform to say black lives matter then well it's cause you're a racist you must hate black people you must want black people to die now it's the same thing but they're in certain different groups different ethnic groups if you do not use your platform to say this to speak out about israel it means that you hate youtube if you do not use your platform candace to say that it is sad to see a photo of a dead arab girl then it's because you want all palestinians dead that's emotional blackmail that is what's happening on the internet today it's emotional blackmail i see gal gadot the woman that played wonder woman trending and people are angry at her she served in the idf and they are saying that gal gadot wants arab children dead i see bella hadid trending bella hadid a model they suddenly say you know what bella hadid wants all jewish people to be thrown into the ocean if you agree with bella hadid then you agree with that message if you agree with gal gadot then you agree with that message emotional blackmail here in america we don't have an expert problem we have a non-expert problem we have too many people that don't know what they're talking about that cannot seem to close their mouths i'd like to speak on behalf of the non-experts the people that have the courage to admit that they don't know everything and that they'd like to take time to learn and i want to make something abundantly clear silence is not violence sometimes silence actually allows us to hear the debate sometimes hearing the debate allows us to learn and sometimes learning allows us to think critically about our own ideas and to form our opinions it took me years to form opinions about the pro-choice versus the pro-life debate i started pro-choice i ended up pro-life similarly it took me a really long time to learn i read multiple books about the environmental lobby about climate change and why i don't believe it and when i felt comfortable on my two feet i spoke out when i felt comfortable that i could defend my positions i spoke out not when the internet told me to be a fraud and to come up with an opinion because it's trending right now sometimes silence is courage it's courage despite all of the noise on the internet speaking out and saying i don't know and when it's coming from me i want you guys to know something silence is simply authenticity thanks for joining me on this episode of candace i have some very exciting news to share right now we are running a giveaway for one

end the panel on is my favorite person alexandria ocasio-cortez who has perverted what it means to be a socialist obviously we know that she went to the mat gala but did you see that there's a little mini doc about it so here's what it looks like to constantly fight for poor people let's check it out [Music] struggle is so real yes i want to be poor that's what it's like [Music] what is this yeah what am i watching all the servants have masks there's someone putting lotion on her arm all the all the servants are covered but she's not see that that's key poverty yeah first thing that comes to my mind struggling people the struggle is real look look how they carry they carry the trains the other carrying the train for her i think it's hilarious that the the designer of the dress is a tax cheat too oh yeah [Music] we're in the van on the way there rebecca's in here and others designer and stuff so we're like in there we're gonna be hit the carpet and it's gonna continue our up talking while we [Music] i'm trying to get the lighting it says tax the rich [Music] [Music] here's my thing is there anybody in america who honestly objectively believes that she's a champion for the poor i think there's a few idiots that must like how could better turn that into champion for the poor this has been uh every socialist regime in history turns out this way by the way yes it's always socialism is for you not for me right i live off of you it reminds me you know i was looking i can't get over the fact honestly i can't get over it the masks on the servants as they carry the train they fluff out the dress etc but no masks on her it reminds me of you know as as as many as as much of great literature there is out there you know i got to give a credit to hunger games because you know they have the servants and hunger games what in the capitals right while everyone is poor well everyone's locked down the servants are walking around and all their tongues cut out meanwhile you know the difference is we don't have hunger games we just send our kids over to afghanistan to die yeah um and that's where we watch that on tv so this is and this is what goes on in the capital we all supposed to just sit back and say oh how the odds may be ever in our favor yeah she i mean she had someone lotioning her right forearm there's someone in there lotioning her right forearm and yet she's like well it doesn't matter if i do all of the stuff because at least i'm wearing a dress that says tax the rich right at least and we're supposed to think because the designer is black then somehow it means that she's really fighting that she took so many pictures with the designer she's really fighting for the underdog well let's actually check the stats on this designer who made her dress that's actually kind of amazing um the designer is aurora james and she currently has three open tax warrants for failing to withhold income taxes from employees paychecks totaling 40 000 she also has six federal liens legal claims against property for failing to pay a tax set totaling 103 000 plus and she also received 41 000 in pandemic relief aid and she bought a 1.6 million dollar hollywood hills home in september of 2020 and owes 2 500 plus in property taxes on the property how about tax the rich dress made by a person who refuses to pay their taxes yeah and then i guess there's a lawsuit as well from chick-fil-a because she ripped off their bag i think that is the but it's the exact same thing it's the white with the exact same red basically somebody trolled aoc into wearing a chick-fil-a bag it's just it's just you just have to appreciate the irony and the never-ending hypocrisy yeah i'm i'm more of i guess i'm more of a traditionalist because i'm sure you know

wore the dress she's like i'm rich and i like being rich right exactly right that's the point it's like aos the rich she wants to be the rich that's it that is every socialist any person that's on a platform telling you that they hate the rich know they envy the rich which is fine they want to be the rich and the way that they realize they can do that is by convincing a bunch of poor people to elect them positions of power so they can figure out how to tax more rich people and just i mean this is just obviously what socialism is it's what it always has been do you have more does she have more houses than bernie sanders at this point maybe maybe exactly all the socialists seem to have tons of housing please you guys send me to a 35 000 ticket event so i can help you she's in a little

nothing more elitist than do these constant stuff she's doing with vogue she's a glamour i mean she wants to be an elitist does that feel attainable to you walking out having people snap photographs

biologically male camp uh counselors who identify they identify as women and they are being allowed to right now the parents are furious uh sleep in the room with fifth grade girls uh for three nights during a school organized science camp so this is how woke it's become they're now obviously when you go away for camp or you go anywhere that you have female counselors um for sleep away camp and now they're allowing people that self-identify as females to do that that is very scary to think about because i have always said for the last few years that what's coming next is we're just going to start to see pedophilia right behind this trans movement and they're going to say it's not pedophilia it's it's this is just a man dressed as a woman that's doing this well what i don't understand is that the way i heard the story originally reported by at least the post-millennial is that it was a yeah non-binary counselor who was sleeping with girls and it's like what if you're non-binary why does that automatically place you with the female campers that seems kind of strange to me because to be non-binaries to be some other third thing i i understood so that just seems very manipulative and also um i've had people criticize the parents in this situation saying well they should not have put that their children in that situation if they were uncomfortable with it the parents didn't know right they found out after the fact and i think if the camp had been upfront about what was going on there is no way that i i hope most of the parents would have sent their kids to be in that situation and parents just don't know i think that's a really important point that we often forget the opposite of this is happening very frequently especially in california where children and teenagers are saying well now i identify as trans or i identify as non-binary and when they go to school sleep away camp or they go on school field trips they're sleeping in bunk houses with the opposite gender and parents don't even know about their own children let alone what teachers are identifying as which is absolutely terrifying but you mentioned this ushering in pedophilia and potentially that being the next frontier of the lgbtq alphabet soup community i think that's already happening which is really really scary there are college professors saying well we shouldn't call them pedophiles they're minor attracted people and that's the nice thing to say you're starting to see pride parades encourage parents to bring their children and take pictures with fully naked biological men who are in their middle age maybe they're 40 or 50. i saw that at the pride parade in san francisco which i know you guys just talked about in 2019 this is really really scary stuff and it's not the future it is right now what a perfect place for a predator to hide right when now you're being celebrated and you're saying oh you can be whatever you want like we understand this to be clearly a mental illness right and yet they're saying this is not this is just who this person is what they feel more comfortable um you know they feel more comfortable in their skin if they can be around little kids and they can be around little girls and sleeping uh with little girls in this room so it's very scary it does seem to me and obviously it's been a major theme on the show talking about how our children are under threat in this moment it's no secret that inflation is out of control and we are seeing that more than ever right now in our grocery stores i don't know if you've seen

my pillow goya beasley lakes butter onto my syrup uncle ben's rice eskimo pies mr potato head among many others have been banished to this corner and now the sports world is getting in on the canceling fun as well they seem to have canceled patriotism all together today i'm joined by the founder of outkick and fox sports radio host clay travis to discuss clay thank you for joining me in this magical corner yes first of all this is absolutely spectacular unfortunately i think you're going to have to add some additional rows here probably some additional bookshelves we're going to need a lot of real estate and i saw how quickly you read that yeah i mean you're gonna as you add on and add on yeah it's gonna be gonna be the whole show yeah exactly so we're probably gonna have to purchase a lot of real estate if we're serious about collecting these items which i am not opposed to uh but this week we're to talk about just sort of the cancelling of america is what it feels like and when we really had to trace this sentiment this anti-american sentiment and when it became mainstream you can't help but realize it kind of started with the sports industry and colin kaepernick i think you're right right in 2016 colin kaepernick took a knee a lot of people forget barack obama was president of the united states at the time because people want to conflate it with donald trump but in the preseason game after he had lost his starting job to blame gabbard san francisco 49ers he decided not to stand for the national anthem and from there it became in vogue to do that trendy and now it's almost braver to stand for the national anthem than it is to kneel and you're right because what i've always said is we need places in america where we're all united and you don't think about what might differentiate us right so if you're in a stadium or you're in arena i heard you're opening who if somebody your team wins or your team scores you turn around and high-five somebody you don't think about their race their ethnicity their religion their sexuality any of these identity politics buzzwords you think about the fact that you share a team right cut across tribal differences and it brings you all together and i heard you talking about michael jordan and the way that you felt in 1998 when he hit the jumper against the utah jazz for utah fans out there he definitely pushed off by the way before he hit the jumper but he got away with it but a good stat for you uh in the most recent nba finals they averaged a little over seven million people watching each of the games lebron james's la lakers going up against miami heat when jordan made that jumper 37 million people were watching right and if people said people say well people won't watch sports the same way no no since 1998 when jordan made that jumper the nfl's audience has gotten a lot bigger the nba's has gone from nearly 37 million people to 7 million people where did those 30 million people go particularly when you consider the united states population has increased by 50 million right and you know i'll tell you they were called racists and they were called white supremacists and a lot of people just got sick of it and said you know what this no longer makes me feel good so why am i giving my money moment anymore right it doesn't make you turn off you just want to turn off politics you want to turn off the weekly stress and they can no longer do that and the argument that you're here on the left is that okay well you know what colin kaepernick is just expressing himself and this is how the flag makes him feel and that should be okay but you realize that that argument kind of falls flat because when people express themselves in the opposite direction oh yeah case in point drew brees yes um when he made a very sound argument uh for standing for the national anthem it didn't garner the same reaction so let's actually watch the clip of what drew brees said that was so controversial i will never agree with anybody um disrespecting the flag of the united states of america or our country let me let me just tell you what i see or what i feel when the national anthem is played and when i look at the the flag of the united states i envisioned my two grandfathers who fought for this country during world war ii one in the army and one in the marine corps both risking their lives to protect our country and to try to make our country and this world a better place so every time i stand with my hand over my heart looking at that flag and singing the national anthem that's what i think about and in many cases it brings me to tears thinking about all that has been sacrificed not just those in the military but for that matter those throughout the civil rights movements of the 60s and everyone and all that has been endured by so many people up until this point that's flawless for an athlete let's just be honest he's not a professional politician he doesn't speak for a living that is as flawless to me of an answer about why you stand for the national anthem as could be given he got killed for it yeah why did he get killed for this this actually sounded like a uniting message he brought up the civil rights movement uh he brought up his his grandfather said this is what the flag means to me and he was representative of how so many people in america feel because don't forget their sons come back home overseas under that flag in coffins you know when we have the military men that are going overseas and actually sacrificing their lives uh so that we can enjoy these games right and and and yet they said no this is not about teammates candace who posted videos on social media crying because of what you just heard drew brees say oh with friends like that who needs enemies that's what i'm saying i mean because his own teammates threw him under the bus and you were talking i think so perceptively about colin kaepernick the question that i've asked that i think is a fantastic one and i think people will enjoy as well if colin kaepernick had taken a knee while playing for the san francisco 49ers to protest gay marriage being legal they would have demanded that he not be able to play for the san francisco 49ers anymore so when people say they're supporting his first amendment rights that's not true they are supporting first amendment rights of someone saying something they agree with that's right right because regardless of what you think i don't care what you think about gay marriage or abortion or guns or any other hot button issue if the national anthem is playing and you take a stand because you disagree with something about america during the anthem then you are distracting from the reason why people are there which is to celebrate the sport itself and the reason the anthem plays in my mind is to make us all recognize and understand the perspective of how fortunate we all are to be able to show up and care so deeply about something that in the grand scheme of things doesn't really matter that much right like who wins a game i want my team to win you when you play sports you want your team to win but at the end of the day the freedoms that we all share is the reason why we get to care about things like this frivolities yeah and so the nfl was happy to have colin kaepernick have his freedom of speech they were not happy for drew brees about how crazy that is that's his fault he and he had to apologize and let's actually watch his apology i know there's not much that i can say that would make things any better right now but i just want you to see in my eyes how sorry i am for the comments that i made yesterday i know that it hurt many people especially friends teammates former teammates loved ones people that i care and respect deeply that was never my intention i picture somebody like his pr agent just being like read this script it looks like a hostage video it is a hostage video we are a hostage right we're all hostage by the way particularly in sports right like i'm one of the few people who actually was willing to come out and say did you actually watch what he said right that's we played it on my radio show he said this is really eloquent right we talk all the time about how we want athletes to meet the moment compare what drew brees said to what we consider to be oftentimes an incredibly elucidated and well-argued position yeah a lot of times we're lying when we say that athletes have said something really brilliant most of the time it's you know 8th or 9th grade level analysis you'd get a c for it if you wrote it in a paper and you know it also sucks because you you see him talking about the sacrifice yes um that his grandparents nazis not like people you call nazis actual nazis it would have been nice to see drew brees you know fight the actual fascists in this country who don't want him to have freedom of speech um but he didn't do that and that's okay and i want to now arrive at what is the moral of the cancel today uh the moral of the cancel today is that this is not about allowing people to be heard what's going on in this country today is not about hearing different perspectives about hearing one perspective one perspective and that perspective is always about hating america they are fostering an anti-american sentiment if you like the american flag if you believe that we should say the pledge of allegiance if you like the national anthem if you think that that's something that we should all be united around they want you to feel that you should not have a platform and that you should not speak i'm glad that drew brees brought up his grandparents i often think about the generation that ended uh world war ii and one of the most astonishing stories uh for me personally is hearing the story of d-day many people don't know this but those people that were crossing the english channel it was just bad luck that america stormed the beaches of omaha it was just bad luck that that was the beach that so many people got slaughtered but what people don't know is that the average age of those soldiers who landed on that beach was 22 years old while they were crossing the channel it was incredibly choppy i watched this in a documentary it was incredibly choppy and a lot of them uh were crying and saying that they wish that they could go home to their mothers because it was making them so nauseous and they realized that they had really kind of signed themselves up for certain death and yet they went there and they fought and they gave their lives and they gave true sacrifice to this country so that we can enjoy these freedoms so the question i like to ask people in america is how difficult is it for us to also make sacrifices it's really easy to just speak out right to say this is wrong and i'm not going to back down to the online mob more of us should do that because the fact that that is the toughest thing that we have to do stand up to the mob on social media i feel like we have gotten the easy side of this deal that's the moral of the cancel and uh clay i want to thank you for joining me welcome to

candace owens i don't know miss owens i'm not going to characterize her i'm going to let her own words through the talking so i'm gonna play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about adolf hitler i agree i actually don't have any problems at all with the word nationalism i think that it gets uh the definition gets poisoned um by uh leaders that actually want globalism globalism is what i what i don't want so when you think about whenever we say nationalism the first thing people think about in at least in america is hitler you know he was a national socialist but if hitler just wanted to make germany great and have things run well okay fine the problem is is that he wanted he had dreams outside of germany he wanted to globalize he wanted everybody to be german everybody to be speaking german all right so my uh first question is to miss hershenoff miss owens said quote if hitler just wanted to make germany great and have things run well okay fine the problem is that he wanted he had dreams outside of germany so when people try to legitimize adolf hitler does that feed into white nationalist ideology it does mr liu i know that ms owens distanced herself from those comments later but we expressed great concern over the original comments uh miss owen uh miss owens i'm sorry we just started recording um would you like time to respond to that yes um i think it's pretty apparent that uh mr lube believes that black people are stupid and will not uh pursue the full clip in its entirety he purposely presented an extract an extracted clip this will suspend for a moment it is not proper to refer disparagingly or with to a member of the committee uh the witness will not do that again witness may continue sure even though i was called despicable witness may not refer to a member of the committee as stupid i didn't refer to him as stupid that's not what i said that's not what i said at all you didn't listen to what i said may i continue please as i said he is assuming that black people will not go pursue the full two-hour clip and he purposefully extracted he cut off and you didn't hear the question that was asked of me he's trying to present as if i was launching a defense of hitler in germany when in fact the question that was asked of me was returning to whether or not i believed that hitler was a whether or not i believed in nationalism and that nationalism was bad and what i responded to was that i do not believe that we should be characterizing hitler as a nationalist he was a homicidal psychopathic maniac that killed his own people a nationalist would not kill their own people that is exactly what i was referring to in the clip and he purposely wanted to give you a cut up similar to what they do to donald trump to create a different narrative that was unbelievably dishonest and he did not allow me to respond to it which is worrisome and to tell you a lot about where people are today in terms of trying to drum up narratives by the way i would like to also add that i work for prager university which is run by an orthodox jew and a single democrat showed up to the embassy opening in jerusalem i sat on a plane for 18 hours to make sure that i was there i'm deeply offended by the insinuation of revealing that clip without the question that was asked of me", "MqwljvvrKYY": "this is the greatest story that's ever happened in the history of the world um well that's a lead-up it is i'm telling you i know if you guys saw the prospective juror for the parkland shooter shooter trial dismissed after discussing

she can't be a juror because she gotta take care of her sugar daddy here it is no one expected jury selection in the parkland shooter's penalty phase trial to go viral but this clip of a potential

exactly sure what you're talking about and i have my sugar then okay i see him every day that woman mrs bristol a native new yorker says she wasn't trying to weasel her way out of jury duty if i do this kiss for six months i have a hardship that means my sugar that you can't support me she told me that six month time frame would put her in a financial bind how much exactly per month she claims she'll miss out on eight thousand dollars a month the penalty phase for the shooter could last up to six months jurors would have to make a recommendation to the judge of a life or death sentence it's all day for six months and that was my hardship i need my sugar daddy money bristol says she was honest saying her hardship was financial so the judge excused her i said to the judge i have a sugar daddy and i'm married and i have a husband just like the judge heard other more common hardships like having two jobs or a long vacation but none as unique as this one well mrs bristol what are you

attain they don't care about black people they don't care about black history they don't care about unity in fact joe biden actually said this he said that juneteenth is quote a day in which we remember the moral stain and the terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take end quote how does it make you feel do you want to celebrate at least he's being honest right because that's it that is exactly what this holiday is about what this federal holiday is actually about is constantly reminding black americans that we are somehow different that we are apart from the american treatment this is not our country that we should still be angry you call me upon i'm calling you upon if you thought this was a good holiday if you thought this was about anything more than the democrats trying to keep us in a perpetual state of anger and fear", "PmdlEx0dwEY": "i did want to bring up uh what happened to tucker carlson over the weekend because i do think that it's important that we talk about the dialogue that's happening in our society today we have the cliff so you want to watch that yeah yeah let's play it i don't [Music] so take us through what's going on here well so tucker carlson was trying to enjoy a vacation in montana and uh you know he as if anyone knows a big fan of tucker carlson you know he's an avid fly fisher uh fisherman so he's trying to enjoy his vacation in a a fishing store and this apparently a fly fishing guide just berates him uh comes up to him berates him starts telling him he's the i don't know if you guys could hear he's the worst human being um and this is all because they claim you know the left claims tucker carlson is anti-vaccine tucker carlson is is encouraging people not to take it tucker carlson is making people die and that's basically what you hear this guy come up to him and tell him um but it's just interesting to me because i mean we could go into the hypocrisy of so many different things of this but every time i see one of these viral videos of a leftist just coming up to someone whether they're not wearing a mask whether they just don't like them when it's about the coveted situation every single time i see a leftist confront them they're right in their face they're touching them and i'm like yeah you're so scared of this virus that you're you're spitting on each other i'm not sure how that's helpful and i like that it's the ever-expanding definition of anti-vaxx like i used to see people that were adequately against vaccines now it's people that have the vaccine like someone like eric clapton who said you know you know i don't think that we should be mandating vaccines he's now anti-vaccine even though he got the code vaccine now we have to carlson who they're calling anti-vaxx because he's accurately reporting on the vaccines that is now also now included in the umbrella of anti-vaxx anti-vaxx almost most nearly means anything that goes against the government narrative about the vaccines i also love in that clip that's not necessarily just confronting him it's confronting him with somebody else filming filming right like hey if you have a disagreement with somebody i still think it's weird when they're shopping in a fly fisher store like okay do you really need to confront somebody and tell them what you think about them politically regardless of what their beliefs are but when you do it and your buddy is standing there with a phone to record the interaction so you can go viral while you're trying you get right in somebody's face and you try to provoke them i think that's the antithesis of what normal humans do in face-to-face interaction at any point if you're thinking hey i'm going to do this to this person get your camera and go record it i'm automatically on the side of the normal human who isn't that and i give credit to tucker for kind of laughing at the entire situation and walking away but you can see how when you're trying to confront someone who might be out with their family or might be out just having a normal lifestyle we saw this happen in restaurants all over the country in the trump administration you can't eat here get out of here confront maxine waters said you need to find these people and confront them from that cabinet in a restaurant in a department store at a gasoline station [Music] this is not normal human interaction and by the way i don't ever see conservatives walking up to liberals and confronting them and telling them hey you're awful you can't be here seems to be very often a one-way street of course there's a people that are accepting that's right yeah so and you're right about his his demeanor of him being so calm i looked at this and i'm like he's a saint because let me tell you i i i believe that he was with his family that's right i was with his children yes let someone try that with me in my child right and i will record it for you like i am not the one please if you are watching the show please know that we will both end up in prison because i am not allowing any person to to approach me like that with my children yeah definitely violation mama bear but you know children are like they pick up on that stuff do you know how terrifying it is for a child for you to be saying something like that to their father that close to their face like how dare you but that's where you think you are the audacity to approach somebody when they are with your children to push him he wants tucker to do something find candace [Laughter] you leave children out of it you do not traumatize children children are so easily traumatized by events that person is absolutely fundamentally a despicable human being for doing that yeah [Applause]", "PitU4evlFrw": "women in general are just not that nice to each other I always say the movie Mean Girls is kind of real life and a part of this is biological there's an underpinning of biology I've often spoke about a book that I read which was written by an author named E.O Wilson who is a biologist who basically underpins he has this thesis that everything that we do in society and the way that we behave in society you really just have to examine our biology and you can look to examples in the wild to fully understand why we behave in that manner right so why are women a bit cattier with one another than men are right men are kind of they hang out they're totally fine but women are a bit more competitive and a bit more catty and the argument that he puts forth in this book is that well women have to compete and they have to compete for men 400 eggs that's its we are born with all the eggs we're ever going to have so our body is telling us to compete with other women to find another man to start a family", "feJwy7LhUC0": "right when you criminalize sex work sometimes you're criminalizing victims and it can be someone who was forced into prostitution or someone who is destitute and those individuals may need help but the problem with when you say that is totally fine uh to be a sex worker is that what you're signaling to society is that we are creating a market for sex workers and as I have said on this show repeatedly after speaking with Tim Ballard and learning how connected the human sex trafficking rings are to America and our demand for pornographic material Having learned how many sex trafficking victims are found on PornHub and what it would signal if we said actually we don't we actually are even making our our sex Choate even larger prostitution everywhere is okay what it would signal to people that are sex trafficking children and our sex trafficking adults around the world is that our Market has gotten even bigger and that and so that they should continue to execute these horrific crimes against children", "8amKgatxWFk": "welcome back you guys know what time it is it is time for me to answer questions from you guys back at home so let's jump right into it first question how do you feel about pelosi being banned from receiving communion i'm going to be honest it was so timely i actually just got back a couple of days ago from being in budapest hungary and i was sitting at dinner with jack posobik who is catholic and his wife and my husband who is a catholic and i'm protestant for you guys that don't know and we were talking about kind of my husband wanting me to convert to catholicism and what my hang-ups were and i basically was saying to him and jack that i find it so problematic that you have the pope and he has embraced joe biden he has embraced nancy pelosi he's entertained them for for trips he has invited trans kids and i just basically said that um the catholic faith faith is not being reflected in the leadership no sooner did we leave dinner then i got the notification that this incredible priest stood up and just said absolutely not regarding nancy pelosi and her increasingly radical views on abortion and he didn't just say you can't receive communion he issued a very strong condemnation of her views and i thought this is the leadership that has been lacking in my opinion in the catholic church and it was great to see um and i think it's great you know what better way she's you know toward the tail end of her life um i think she's going to hell whether or not she was accepting communion or not and now this is being taken from her i don't think it will edit anything because i believe that woman is evil to her core i don't think she's going to edit her perspectives um i think she's one of those people that just has accepted that she's going to live life the way she wants and probably burn in hell thereafter but good on the catholic church next question what are your oh my god that's so funny jack posovic what are your thoughts on jack posobik being detained at the world economic forum my thoughts are it is fantastic as someone who is a friend of jack he's been a regular on the show and as i said i just was with him at a speaking engagement out in budapest and it's great because jack has the platform to expose exactly what's going on so this is one of those circumstances where they take somebody and just them detaining and taking somebody because of their social media presence is going to make the story a lot bigger and that's exactly what it's done we are finally at a point in society where people are beginning to examine these organizations these these globalist organizations and go wait a second what are they up to what are they ever up to and jack posobik has been brave enough to go right into the fire and it turns out that they want to be able to govern every aspect of our lives but they don't want us sending independent journalists to cover their events so it's brilliant he's the right person to be doing this because he uh to be going through this rather because he's fearless like me so my only hold back would be i wish it was me instead doesn't take much to realize that our economy in this moment is in dire straits you're already starting to see those ripple effects in the housing market as people's buying power has completely diminished have you considered what could happen in the stock market if our economy completely stalls out well don't wait until that happens take some of your profits from the stock market now and solidify them with gold from birch gold

and secure the games that you've made while you can alright final question i would love to hear your thoughts on alec baldwin's comments about the united airline fight i actually just saw this for those of you that are not aware of what happened essentially there was a united airline employee who got into some sort of a verbal dispute with a customer cannot say what happened because that audio is not available but we do know that the united airlines employee punched the customer in the face after he punched the customer in the face the customer responded by giving him a beat down and the united airline employee ended up on the ground bizarrely alec baldwin came to the defense of the united airline employee i don't think there's ever a justification for punching a customer in the face um but you know alec baldwin likes violence what's actually more interesting was the tweet that he issued in defense of the united airline employee where he talks about workplace safety i mean alec baldwin truly just has to be out of his mind completely unaware of the situational irony of him suddenly becoming an authority on workplace safety after he killed somebody and has thus far gotten away with it he shouldn't have but obviously we are seeing what ends up happening with that particular case sometimes it's best to keep your mouth shut but keeping your mouth shut is impossible when you are alec baldwin and you are a narcissist elitist so that is my perspective on that scenario thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel

across the nation in fact in case you're not aware we are now at a critical point 300 people 300 people per A Day in the United States are dying from accidental fentanyl overdoses we know this is happening because of the opioid crisis people are that are actually pursuing fentanyl are addicted to it are looking for a high because perhaps they were given some drugs when they got a tooth pulled and they were turned into addicts searching for something that could sustain those highs I don't know how to communicate this message more effectively than to Simply say that we now live in a society

they are enjoying people that they themselves want to be like people that they're emulating by learning every lyric to their songs it's ridiculous it's hypocritical it's double standard and I hate it", "uH2g6EoT0Tg": "there's another dark scenario going on that i am just so fired up about um there's so much i can say let's just start from the top which is project veritas um the fbi is raiding project veritas um and they have gone first they went after a bunch of the journalists and they and they took a lot of their property and then they finally rated project veritas's the founder who we've had on the show james o'keefe he's a wonderful friend um james o'keefe is a real fighter and a patriot and i stand by him 100 in everything that he does um he is a total professional and uh they said that they rated him over ashley biden's diary uh it came into james o'keefe's possession he actually did not run the contents of it and he handed it over uh to police uh he did not actually run the contents of that diary and in that diary she wrote about her mobile station as a child and she also wrote quite tellingly um about showers that made that inappropriate showers that she had with her dad when she was young and she says you see at a young age showers with my dad probably not appropriate and i remember when this diary was making the rounds way back when i didn't believe that this was real like i just thought to myself there's no way that this diary is real it's almost like too perfect you know we saw the images of biden being weird with young girls smelling their hair touching them making them super uncomfortable and he kind of that's kind of when he earned the moniker creepy joe biden and then this diary came out and i said there's just no way that that's real well now this is a you know and this is basically a confirmation from the fbi that it is real because they are raiding james o'keefe they're waiting project paradise to see how they got their hands on it by the way definitively not an excuse for the fbi to read anybody's home just so you guys know if you study supreme court cases even if a journalist acquires a piece of a piece of information and the person who gave it to them the third party person got it illegally the journalist has a right to publish it as long as the journalist was not involved in the illegal activity correct so there's two competing stories ashley biden says that it was stolen from her the person who got their hands on it you know it was confirmed by somebody else says that she left it behind allah hunter's laptop left it behind what are you gonna do and now it's not in her control and she's freaking out but the story that's getting ignored here is ashley biden saying that her father showers with her right showered with her when she was young and the showers were inappropriate well look at what happened with the hunter biden laptop i mean a 200 year old publication the new york post got banned off twitter you know the sitting president of the united states donald trump was banned off social media if you are going after the regime the deep state the people in power really pulling the strings you will get attacked they will protect their their people uh i think they are protecting joe biden here you're right there's uh allegations of criminal activity evident in here you know and trump's tax returns got published by the new york times and i didn't see the fbi raiding anyone to find out where they got those tax returns so uh you know james o'keefe if you look at what he's done recently he exposed a whistleblower from pfizer he exposed a whistleblower in the dhs for saying that they're changing immigration laws to allow more people in uh and he exposed uh the recent new jersey governor's race where they uh the campaign manager said they're gonna do a vaccine mandate after murphy gets back in so he has no shortage of enemies of people in power and now we have the fbi doing raids for a stolen diary when people like congressman matt gates have to plead publicly for the doj to help him when people have credible threats against his life and only after he does that do they arrest someone so there is a clear uh misjustice being carried out injustice being carried out here uh and i hope that james o'keefe is not only proven innocent that the first amendment right to free speech and free press is protected but that he makes a lot of money suing these people for what they've done to him amen remember that [Applause] we will continue with the show in just one second but first we need to discuss protecting your retirement it was recently announced that social security benefits are going to be increased by 5.9 in january that is the highest increase in 40 years this is the government admitting that inflation is out of control and yet the left is still pushing through trillions more in spending now is the time to protect your retirement savings by investing in gold

qualifying purchase by december 23rd text candace 248 4848 and protect your savings today i mean our doj is impossibly corrupt and the media cohorts are impossibly corrupt right behind them because could you just imagine if ivanka trump had a diary that got released and she said that i had inappropriate showers with my dad when i was when i was younger and could you imagine what the media would look like right i mean he offered her a compliment and they tried to pervert it and make it sound like he had feelings for ivanka you now have in your possession an admission from biden's daughter that she had inappropriate showers uh with with her with her father and there's no questions i can't imagine under what scenario a dad would shower with their daughter and beyond that i want to make this very clear this is the second incestuous claim that has come from the from the mouth of you know from the mouth up from the words of an actual biden relative right when as you spoke about hunter laptops came out i always wanted people that had my twitter account locked out because i shared text messages between hunter biden and his parents our first lady and president saying please please please do whatever you can i'm paraphrasing here saying this story cannot get out it was about allegations of him hunter biden sleeping with his niece okay and he said if this ever gets out my life will be ruined again i'm paraphrasing basically was saying to his parents this cannot get out or my life is going to be ruined now we are talking again about somebody that was very young a young lady in their family that was allegedly speaking to a therapist about something that happened and the media had a blackout about it they took it down they said the laptop wasn't real then well it's time to re-up that conversation because if there are actual sex victims in the biden clan if there are actual claims of incestuous behavior and sexual allegations in the biding clan we should be having a wide open discussion and shame on any journalist who is too afraid of our corrupt doj to talk about something that could potentially save the lives of young women that are being victimized by their own family members and don't forget these are the same people these are the same politicians that will turn around and give perfectly worded scripted speeches about how much they care about youth in this country and their safety they spent months lecturing people about how many children were sexually assaulted at the border don't seem to care about that anymore by the way but this is a recurring theme that we're starting to see pop up in this biden administration that's conveniently being swept under the rug over and over and over again when it comes to corporate media but let's not forget who the fbi works for nobody's talking about that nobody's realizing this is probably a very overt order from the president of the united states when it comes to the department of justice when it comes to the federal bureau of investigation do what you can to squash this story raid the house get rid of the evidence let's let's try to move forward from this and my question would be to the administration where is the coms department was it no did nobody stand up and say you know this might actually look pretty bad if we send the fbi over to james o'keefe's house and try to raid his house and get rid of any evidence for this story this to me seems to be a scramble let's get the story under the rug let's try to cover it up as much as we possibly can before more information gets out and some media outlets have actually authenticated that this is in fact her diary this is in fact if it's not gonna die do you think that they rated for a fake diary exactly so that would be the image of that looks bizarre enough but there is so much yet to unpack with this story my fear would be it's been too early now that everything's been raided the story's been taken advantage of now by the government and the truth might not get out there but any any child whoever is a victim of this type of behavior be it your father or someone else definitely deserves justice and that's the real story here my gosh imagine if business insiders spent the last eight months looking into maybe hunter biden and joe biden in the sexual claims rather than dave port or point noy and the consensual sex that he was having throughout his entire lifetime wouldn't that be a different world that we lived in right could you imagine if that was the outcome that we might uncover i think i think that biden is a sick sick man i'm telling you i think he's a sick sick man i think there are more skeletons in that family's closet than even in the clinton family closet and that is saying a lot that is saying a lot that is saying a lot i i so mean it thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new videos if you want

candace today i'm going to be sitting down and interviewing president donald trump just something i've noticed when he is interviewed by anybody it's never a true journalistic endeavor on the left when they sit down with him they just try to smear him live they're just looking to write the next hit piece to pretend that he is a horrible human being but on the right we have the opposite problem we fawn over him we say when are you going to be president next we miss you what are you coming back neither one of these represent real interviews and i would like to change that today today i'm going to sit down with him and i'm going to give him a fair but a tough interview with critiques that have come from his own side i voted for president trump make no mistake but there are tons of questions that need answering and i hope that i'm able to deliver that to you all today welcome to candace", "ltARI14F20M": "welcome back ladies and gentlemen so you may have heard but last week texas passed its heartbeat bill banning abortions after six weeks in response everyone's favorite representative alexandria ocasio-cortez took to cnn to defend the supposed right to kill an unborn baby not the baby of a woman of course but rather of a menstruating person let's watch and i will then offer her a counterpoint well i find governor abbott's comments disgusting and i think there's twofold one i don't know if he is familiar with a menstruating person's body in fact i do know that he's not familiar with a woman with a a female or menstruating person's body because if he did he would know that you don't have six weeks is that quote unquote six weeks and i'm sorry we have to break it down on you know break down biology 101 on national television but in case no one has informed him before in our life in his life six weeks pregnant means two weeks late for your period and two weeks late on your period for any person any person with a menstrual cycle can happen if you're stressed if your diet changes or for really no reason at all i think we are all anderson cooper who's kind of just like [Music] not really sure what's going on here why can't you say a woman why can't you say women so of course the internet exploded with this going how bizarre that she feels that she can't even say woman or women and on twitter she hit back and she said not just women trans men and non-binary people can also menstruate some women also don't menstruate for many reasons including surviving cancer that require a hysterectomy gop mad at this are protecting the patriarchal idea buzzword feminist buzzword that women are most valuable as uterus holders and then uh she went on and said a few more things she said trans to spirit and non-binary people have always existed and will always exist people can stay mad about it if they want or they can grow up peace sign rainbow flag not sure what that flex flag is but i'm sure the rainbow flag gave birth to it whatever it is i think i think somebody's telling me in my ear it's a trans flag so many flags i'm so much fun before we continue let's talk about something that is priceless protecting your retirement inflation is here and it's not going away our government does not have a solution but birch gold does protect your savings against inflation by diversifying into gold and silver with birch gold group if you haven't reached

here but my favorite part is that just this morning uh aoc uh got into a tif not related to this actually on sunday she got into a tiff not related to this uh which was with joe manchin and he called her young lady to be polite he said when this young lady and she got really mad and she said in washington i usually know my questions of power are getting somewhere when the powerful stop referring to me as congresswoman and start referring to me as a young lady instead so now she wants to refer to as congresswoman so that changed because aoc doesn't remember her stupid from yesterday when she piles on the stupid up today so let's just sit back at all of this okay ready for the counterpoint so counterpoint number one aoc to your point about menstruating persons yuck um a general rule that i like to follow and debate is that if i'm too scared to even acknowledge the existence of the group of individuals i'm purporting to be defending i probably have no business in the debate say it with me it really is that easy i cannot stress to you how unbelievably childish it is that you're too scared to acknowledge your own gender you should be in attendance nowhere that requires adult conversation and i shudder to think that you are a sitting member of congress it truly is a sign of the times also you claim women are being oppressed but what can be more oppressing to women than the idea that we're no longer allowed to exist you are quite literally promoting the concept that women need to be disappeared it's a linguistical genocide that you're trying to commit all to accommodate men by the way who happen to think that they're women that's about as rich as irony possibly gets counterpoint number two to your point about patriarchal ideas the patriarchy i've got really bad news aoc if gender isn't real then neither is the patriarchy poof it's gone if men can be women and women can be men then abortion is now everybody's issue you're upset with governor abbott why what's the difference between you and him see how stupid works when it just keeps going on [Applause] and lastly to your point about the gop attempting to reduce us to uteruses i think i can speak on behalf of all women everywhere when i say that if we are forced to choose we would much rather be known as uteruses than menstruating persons seriously it's disgusting [Music] [Applause] thanks for joining me

terms of tweeting out a photo of a police officer and saying you're next by the way if a white person had done that and it was a picture of a black police officer they would have lost all of their sponsorships within 30 seconds it would have been done gone goodbye you are out of the nba you are not allowed to make a living anywhere and you can't even talk about it but he's lebron james he's black so he can do this to this police officer who saved a life and actually the update of this story is that a black police officer actually wrote an open letter to him and challenged him to sit down with him um and he says i don't know if this will ever reach you but my hope is that one day i can sit down with you and talk as a man of faith i can have no hatred toward you but i do feel i can help you understand the reality of profession of policing and that there is another side you need to hear you are tired of black folks dying so am i you hate racism and police brutality so do i but you cannot paint eight hundred thousand men and women who are of all racist faiths sexual orientations and are also mothers fathers sons daughters preachers coaches community members and just human with such a broad and destructive brush amen officer dion joseph will lebron james take him up on this offer no way no way he'd be humiliated within the first 30 seconds because he'd have to acknowledge that he's ever done something wrong and it is true that the nba covers for lebron doing all sorts of terrible things whether he's covering for china's subjugation of hong kong or whether he's tweeting out openly anti-semitic things which you did just a couple of years ago remember when myers leonard the miami heat uttered an anti-semitic slur and it looked like it was by accident right then he apologized for it and he ended up basically losing his job lebron a couple of years ago tweeted out like a full-on anti-semitic lyric about jewish money nothing absolutely nothing so lebron can get away with pretty much anything the culture has decided that he's a thought leader for some odd reason since he has no thoughts but it's it's truly it's truly astonishing to me that he will slander police officers this way if you want to get black people killed the best way to do it is to remove cops from high crime areas and that's exactly what lebron james is stumping for and is what the entire anti-police movement is going to achieve the the crime rates the the homicide rates in the 34 biggest cities in america rose 30 last year 30 there's a study that came out recently it suggested that between 2014 and 2019 not even including what's happened since 2020 when the murder rates rose again between 2014 and 2019 the cities where they had major riots or protests over ferguson for example they had they experienced a slight decline in police shootings because the police stopped policing but they saw between 1 000 and 6 000 more homicides in those cities the vast majority of those presumably were people who were low income and or people of color the the people who are going to pay the price for lebron james virtue signaling both are are the people who are living in these communities 100 i always say i've never seen a progressive policy that didn't lead directly to aggressive results for the black community over and over again and that's exactly what's going to happen and i think also the point lebron misses is the damage he did to his own cause i think there are a lot of people in america kind of on the middle about the police brutality issue they see videos like george floyd they say this is horrible i want to be on the side combating this but then they say wait a second to be on this side i have to agree with people like lebron that are saying that this cop who is a hero for saving young black women's life is evil and should be doxxed and be held accountable whatever that means i don't want to be on that side anymore i'm not really sure about that i think lebron just pushed a lot of people in the middle of america to the other side ratings are down which is why oscar ratings are down america is tired of the virtue signaling but more importantly they're tired of the lying you're tired of the lie when he did what everyone else did is that they see a clip a viral clip they jump to conclusions uh they want to push this narrative that cops are racist they're going after black people in communities not true then when they find out the real facts they never apologize they double and triple down which is exactly what he did so he's not going to take anyone up on any offer and he's also not going to get rid of his private security guards that are armed by the way and all these folks that want to defund the police they all can afford security guards we know the squad is running around with their security guards spending thousands and thousands of dollars of taxpayer dollars protecting themselves yet they want to hurt everyone else and they want to take away our guns too yep this story was particularly ridiculous it was particularly ridiculous because the underlying case which was the makia bryant case that's what he was saved a black life saved a black life makia bryant was attempting to stab another black girl and the cop came and saved that girl's life but here's the thing if the cop had showed up and not stopped the killing then that black girl would be dead and the media wouldn't care yeah the media would not care the media stand if you do damned if you don't they do not care if a black person dies so long as the person who does the killing is not a cop", "gocdPsPuxY0": "Olivia Wilde what do you know about Olivia Wilde well I'll tell you the first thing you need to know is that Olivia Wilde is a feminist and if you didn't know she was a feminist check this picture out of her wearing a shirt that says feminist okay and in case this shirt is not making clear that she's a feminist she also Once Upon a Time wore this skirt and the skirts if you can't read it and you're listening to this podcast it says feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist but hello it's like 300 times around the skirt in case you missed it Olivia Wilde is a feminist and in case you are someone who only speaks English she also wore this yes that is Olivia Wilde wearing a shirt and in French reads I don't know if I'm saying that right because I don't speak French but I'm pretty sure it means that she's a feminist and in case that wasn't abundantly clear to you yet she was a feminist just check her out wearing this [\u00a0__\u00a0] hat yeah there she is there she is she's a feminist guys and it's pink because girls like pink she's a feminist now of course like all good feminists Olivia sometimes gets attacked by men and she usually likes to get attacked by men when she's trying to further her career so Olivia Wilde had a long relationship she has two children and about a 10-year relationship with an actor named Jason Sudeikis and it was convenient for her she had a movie that she was directing and producing that is called don't worry darling and in wanting to do press for this movie it was convenient for her that she was going through this separation with Jason Sudeikis and a processor served her papers while she was at uh Comic-Con I believe yeah cinemacon rather and so because this processor served her papers in public which by the way has happened since the beginning of time that processors like to do this because they know for a fact that a celebrity will be on a red carpet uh there was a DJ named French Montana who got served at a club because he was making an appearance when it happens to Olivia Wilde it is an attack and it is an attack that can be used to promote her movie so she gave this statement about being served papers relating to custody over their children she said quote it was my workplace in any other workplace it would be seen as an attack it was really upsetting it shouldn't have been able to happen there was a huge breach in security which is really scary it's scary that's very scary when a processor comes to serve you papers the hurdles that you had to jump through to get into that room with several badges plus special covet tests that had to be taken days in advance which gave you wristbands that were necessary to gain access to the event this was something that required forethought yeah she's under attack guys and she was really really scared because these papers were handed to her in a professional manner and like I said she's on a special snowflake this has happened many times in the past to celebrities but it happened to a woman who is also did I mention a feminist she goes on to say I hated that this nastiness distracted from the work of so many different people and the studio that I was up there representing to try to sabotage that was really vicious but I had a job to do I'm not easily distracted oh wow she is just so brave what a brave feminist woman Olivia Wilde is now weigh this against by the way Jason sudeikis's statement which he gave about the incident which sounds totally stable he says quote the papers were drawn up to establish jurisdiction pardon this is actually his representative giving the quote quote papers were drawn up to establish jurisdiction relating to the children of Ms Wilde and Mr sedakis Mr sedakis had no prior knowledge at the time or a place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved and he would never condone her being served in such an inappropriate manner Jason also went on to say the same thing and documents to the court he said essentially I was horrified to see that she was served Mr public Manner and I deeply apologize for this he sounds like a normal person of course he had no idea that she was going to be served there but this created a very good reason for her to get out into the press and to purport herself to be a victim so that people would buy tickets to her movie which by the way everyone says kinda sucks but that wasn't enough because you can take down one man you know feminist you take down one man to get pressed but what if you take down two people initially uh before she cast Harry Styles as the lead in this movie don't worry darling she had cast Shia LaBeouf so Shia LaBeouf has notoriously struggled in the public sphere with alcoholism with drugs he's been to treatment centers Olivia Wilde knows all of this but the most notorious situation came about when FKA twigs his former lover and girlfriend filed a lawsuit against him claiming that she was being abused now Olivia wild saw this as an opportunity and since the public didn't know why exactly Shia LaBeouf was no longer in the film and her film was coming out she basically gave a statement to variety magazine which heavily implied that she dropped him because she was of course a feminist and she would never want to condone this sort of person being on her set she even talks about the ethos of her set and he just did not go and go in line with the kind of ethos that she wanted to have on this set and so of course the public ate this up and believed this until Shia LaBeouf came out and he replied to this and he released a letter that he wrote to her in response to the interview that she gave to variety apparently what she is saying just wasn't true at all and he even released a video that she sent to him begging him to stay in the film first let's watch the video uh I just went riding course very sweaty but I wanted to reach out because I feel like I'm not ready to give up on this yet and I too am heartbroken and I want to figure this out and you know I think this might be a bit of a wake-up call for Miss flow and I want to know if you're open to giving this a shot with me with us if she really commits if she really puts her her mind and heart into it at this point and if you guys can make peace and I respect your point of view I respect hers but if you guys can do it what do you think is there hope is there hope you let me know okay bye I don't know kind of sounds like she's begging Shia to be in the film and on top of that when she says Miss Flo she's referring to Florence Pew who was the other lead actress on this movie and she's sort of throwing her under the bus maybe maybe Miss Flo can get her stuff together this coming of course from feminist Olivia begging to a guy to please say on the film and that hopefully Miss flow will get her stuff together and make this happen but more importantly I want to read I want to read Shia LaBeouf's response to Olivia in this letter that he wrote her this email that he sent to her after seeing what she said in variety now again I as I mentioned child of buff has struggled with addiction but he's clean now and he has been sober for a while now and he wrote her this email with a lot of clarity and I think it deserves more air time he wrote Olivia I hope this finds you inspired purposeful fulfilled and well I pray every night that you and your family have health happiness and everything God would give me no joke every night before I go to sleep I have a little girl Isabelle she is five months old and just beginning to develop the last half of her laugh it's amazing Mia my wife and I have found each other again and are journeying toward a healthy family with love and mutual respect I have embarked on a journey that feels Redemptive and righteous I write to you now with 627 days of sobriety and a moral compass that never existed before my great humbling that was the last year and a quarter of my life I reached out to you a few months ago to make amends and I still pray that one day you can find space in your heart to forgive me for the failed collaboration that we shared what inspired this email today is your latest variety story I'm greatly honored by your words on my work thank you that felt good to read I'm a little confused about the narrative that I was fired however you and I both know the reasons for my exit I quit your film because your actors and I couldn't find time to rehearse I have included as a reminder of the screenshots of our text exchange on that day and my text to Toby I know that you are beginning your press run for don't worry darling that the news of my firing is attractive click bait as I am still persona non grata and may remain as such for the rest of my life but speaking of my daughter I often think about the news article she will read when she is literate and though I owe and I will owe for the rest of my life I only owe for my actions my feelings with Twigs quick break to remind you Twigs is the ex-girlfriend that filed the lawsuit against him my feelings with Twigs are fundamental and real but they are not the narrative that has been presented there was a time and a place to deal with such things and I'm trying to navigate a nuanced situation with respect for her and the truth hence my silence but the situation with your film and my quote firing will never have a court date with which to deal with the facts if lies are repeated enough in the public they become truth and so it makes it that much harder for me to crawl out of the hole I have dug with my behaviors to be able to provide for my family firing me never took place Olivia and while I fully understand the attractiveness of pushing that story because of the current social landscape the social currency that it brings it is not the truth so I'm humbly asking as a person with an eye toward making things right that you correct the narrative as best you can I hope none of this negatively negatively affects you and that your film is successful in all the ways that you want it to be every blessing to you Shia I mean wow what a it's a beautiful letter it's a beautiful lover letter from a man that is going through a Redemptive process he had found God actually on the set of his last film in which he plays a priest I believe don't quote me on that I'm not sure but he has turned to the Catholic church and he is speaking about his faith Journey so Shia is a different man today than he was even three years ago and the idea that Olivia would use his struggle to promote her film and also put out this lie that she dumped him because she's feminist AF I mean I really think that that illustrates her toxicity Beyond this and this is notable the female lead actress Florence Pugh refuses to speak to Olivia she refused it to refuse to attend all of the press junkets pertaining to the film as it came out and on the actuary that it premiered which she was contractually obligated to go to the premiere she did not speak with the Press she did not speak to Olivia and she was sat a few chairs apart from her so that she never had to engage in her so apparently this feminist AF person can't even have a productive and respectful relationship with the person that she has cast in her film doesn't exactly sound very feminist to me which then brings me to number four which is the problematic relationships that she has of course dragging her ex into the public sphere dragging Shia LaBeouf into the public sphere in a negative way but also I just want to mention that Olivia is about to be 40 she's 38 years old and she is now engaged in this relationship with Harry Styles who is a 28 year old man she has two children now I'm not saying that relationships can't work between a woman who is 38 years old and a man who is 28 year old but um yeah no I am I am saying that they tend not to work so this is going to be interesting to see I do not think it's going to work out for her she to me seems to be a woman that is spiraling and is being publicly insane she's Olivia Wilde is not a stable human being and she needs to be called out for this toxicity thanks for joining me on this episode

her career on barney so she's kind of always been in the public eye from the time that she was a small child and i don't think there is a greater example of an artist today that has followed really the leftist cult meaning that everything that they sell she embraces and then she then sells to her followers i'm talking about body positivity she talks about her struggles with her body and now she kind of views people that are overweight as being brave and she encourages them and she applause them online demi lovato just going through her history with drugs and mental illness in 2009 she tried cocaine at 17 years old while working for the disney channel 2010 at 18 years old she entered a treatment center for the first time to address her issues with eating and self-harm among other issues in 2011 she left rehab and she revealed that she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2013 she checked into a los angeles sober house in 2018 she sought treatment again after a near fatal heroin and fentanyl overdose in 2021 she announced that she was non-binary and that she wanted to be referred to as they and them and also during an interview on cbs sunday morning she said that she smokes a little weed and she drinks moderately and referred to that as being californian sober 2021 in her peacock series she sang to a ghost after it supposedly revealed they had experienced trauma that was caused by sexism yeah i'm going to read that one again in her 2001 peacock docu-series she sang to a ghost after the ghost supposedly revealed to her that it had experienced trauma that was caused by sexism and then recently she revealed that she re-adopted the pronouns she and her okay so i want to talk about her because as i said she is just evidence her life and i do actually say this with true compassion in my heart because i i see her entire life as one big cry for help and she keeps holding on to all of these left dispositions i guess hoping that they're going to help her if she embraces being non-binary if she embraces being california sober if she leans in to i don't know looking into ghosts and having a series about trying to find ghosts in reality what she wants to find is god what she's looking for is spiritual direction you know demi lovato is so emblematic of everything that's wrong with hollywood of what happens when you celebrate yourself right when you lean into mental illness talking about oh it's so brave to talk about your various mental illnesses it's so brave to be pop but you know body positive it's an act of bravery to change your pronouns in your bio and to identify as all of these different things ultimately because you're not happy with yourself these people are are miserable on the inside this is why the shia la la buff transformation i hope is something that demi lovato is paying attention to i want demi lovato to get better i actually i i feel such a sadness for her because everything that she is saying this attention that she's looking for when she pretends that it's about sexism it's about misogyny she's gay she's lesbian she went through a period where she was dating a woman uh and that's when she said she was non-binary at the end of the day she is a sad sad soul that is looking for direction and she's not going to find it in beverly hills she's not going to find it in los angeles she's not going to find it from the paparazzi she's going to find it when she begins living her life more conservatively when she stops following these hollywood trends these demonic hollywood trends and so she recently gave a statement that this current tour is going to be her last she posted this on a bunch of instagram stories saying that she was quote so effing sick i can't get out of bed i can't do this anymore this next tour will be my last i love and thank you guys end quote i hope that her real friends reach out to her i hope that her family surrounds her i i would hate to think that demi's life is going to be somehow shortened uh because she can't find necessary direction that she needs and i hope that people that are watching this story aside from praying for her she does need our prayers learn a lesson actually take a second and examine the way that she has lived her life why it is that money and attention and applause fake applause and trophies like the one that lizzo is getting um don't actually fulfill

that this man who now identifies as a woman is also able-bodied he does not have anything wrong with his body at all but that is not stopping him from getting himself around in a wheelchair and telling people that he self-identifies um as somebody who is paralyzed so on October 28th good morning Norway aired an interview with yorand Victoria almei 53 year old able-bodied male who now identifies as a disabled woman in the interview he stated that he had always wished that he had been born a woman who was paralyzed from the waist down despite having no physical handicaps he currently utilizes a wheelchair almost all the time so in addition to having General dysphoria which is a mental illness and should be characterized as such he also claims to have body Integrity disorder right and he cites a dissonance between how he perceives himself and how his body functions this is a quote for him he said I have struggled with this every day my whole life it is a cognitive dissonance in the same way that I experienced being a woman in a man's body I experienced that I should have been paralyzed from the waist down this is not a desire to be a burden on society it is about the wheelch wheelchair being an aid for me to function everyday life both privately and at work I just want to give a little Applause here and say Bravo because actually I like the story so much because this individual is telling the truth I like I personally like the sentence this is the same way that I experience being a woman in a man's body I experienced I should have been paralyzed from the waist down it is the same way both of these things are mental illnesses and they must be addressed as such obviously there is something happening in your brain where you are not thinking clearly and you need to get psychological help you don't need a society aiding you on you don't need a society that is telling you that yes you are in fact paralyzed it's just oh I don't know abled bodyness is a gender construct able bodyness is a social construct whatever it is um that these idiots are saying today and I think that I like this and I hope that more people start to claim to have body Integrity disorder and I'm going to tell you why because it's going to take something like this right for people to understand the slippery slope of not acknowledging reality right so if we're going to say that man can say that he's a woman okay then we should also say that of course an able-bodied person can say that they're paralyzed and if they can say they're paralyzed why aren't they getting uh wheelchair access does that mean that they should be able to stand in the DMV and get things changed so that they can actually identify as somebody who's paralyzed that means that they should be able to park in the handicap spaces why can't they get a handicap sign for their car these are very important questions and the only way that Society is going to start asking them and trying to draw distinctions between one mental disorder and the other is if people like this start becoming more extreme this might be the only answer to the crazy problem that we have right now in society where we have a bunch of people that are trying to legitimatize mental illness all right guys that's it I'm going to continue reading some of your comments and I'm also going to answer your questions

sitting next to these ladies who just have talking points and it's always uh we hate the Republican Party the Republican party is awful they're actually still trying to keep up the theater that the Insurrection was the worst thing that ever happened in America a couple of grandmas walking through the Capitol building and yet the media pretended actually said didn't pretend actually said that this was similar to 9 11. or thousands and thousands of Americans were killed where planes were hijacked where entire buildings went down they were trying to correlate that to your grandma walking around the Capitol Building uh storming the Capitol Building as they called it as if the Capitol building is not being paid for by the very same people that quote unquote storm did uh here is Ted Cruz if you missed his appearance take a listen try to say the election was fair and square and legitimate you know who y'all don't do that to you don't do it to Hillary Clinton who stood up and said Trump stole the election yeah who said that the election was stolen they sat here yes and said it was illegitimate and you guys were fine with it okay no you know here's the thing we may not like when Republicans win but we don't go and we don't storm we don't try to change but did I miss an entire year of antifa riots where cities across this country your position is the left doesn't engage in violence really no they wanted to know our friend Mike Pence you just accused us of doing something we didn't do you said Hillary Clinton didn't say whatever she didn't say I'm saying to you listen okay [Applause] Trump is an illegitimate president Hillary Clinton says the election is stolen from you Hillary Clinton in 2002 George W Bush was selected Not Elected Joe Biden Al Gore was was elected president so Joe Biden yeah so Whoopi Goldberg doesn't know what antifa is she doesn't know that's the best thing I have no idea what you're talking about who or what is antifa are you we have no idea who they are because they Riot on our behalf they've been rioting not just in America but all across the world there are these little anti-fascists that are in fact the fascists we know that they are a very organized cell of individuals and for whatever reason the FBI just cannot infiltrate this cell of antifa people but I'll tell you what annoys me the most about January 6th is that they always pretend that the issue was that they were not allowed to be in the Capitol building right that they stormed the Capitol building my family person that remembers Brett Kavanaugh can we pour some out for my homie Brett Kavanaugh does anybody remember his confirmation process when all of these individuals were storming into the building trying to stop his confirmation in fact and we will show it to you right now do you not remember when vice president Pence was trying to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and a woman began shrieking yeah take a listen to this flashback awesome [Music] the sergeant-at-arms will restore order in the gallery [Applause] [Music] the sergeant-at-arms will restore order in the gallery [Applause] [Music] so you're going to have to forgive me that I don't really buy Alyssa Farah and these other hosts on The View pretending to be so upset because they were worried about vice president Pence when all of these people were completely silent when vice president had a shrieking woman that had stormed the chambers and was trying to prevent Brett Kavanaugh from becoming confirmed of Supreme Court Justice because he had some beers in high school and by the way he still likes Spears we all still like beers so how about that moving on guys Planned Parenthood is also moving on they've realized that there may be some issues now that women actually get the right to vote on whether or not they want abortion yeah far from the depiction of the mainstream media saying that women's rights were taken away nope women's rights were taken away when we never got the right to vote on whether or not we wanted abortion and now the Supreme Court said this is ridiculous we're sending it back down to the stage so that we can make our own decision about that imagine that imagine women actually having a say on their own bodies and yet the media telling you it's the opposite well Planned Parenthood is not like this at all of course this is what they do this is what they were built upon they were built upon the concept of eugenics getting people that they perceived that Margaret Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood perceived to be too stupid to have Offspring to agree to abort their offspring that was it that was the entire plan for Planned Parenthood so to speak and she was in my opinion one of the most successful progressives of her day obviously because there are women that are now arguing for that right to abort their own offspring not realizing that this was Machiavellian by Design well Planned Parenthood doesn't like that we are being allowed to vote state by stage they're thinking how can we abort more children and they've realized the way to do it is to Target men and to Target men with vans that are actually being called nutcrack crackers and telling men to step inside of these Vans and agree to get vasectomies so Planned Parenthood and a physician with a mobile vasectomy clinic in case you were looking for one of those are going to offer 60 free vasectomies over three days in St Louis Springfield and Joplin Missouri in the first week of November the doctor's name is eskar goren and he wants to take his mobile clinic a vehicle that his friends are dubbing The Nutcracker on the road the following week so if you are looking for a good road show to go to step inside this one because there's going to be free vasectomies for everyone he also plans to offer discounted vasectomies at his regular clinic in the Des Moines area so if that's what you want to do this weekend you can totally get behind that I find it to be interesting I don't think it's gonna have the same appeal this is a weird thing to say but for whatever reason I feel it's easier to convince women to ruin their bodies whether or not we're talking about mutilation or you're talking about getting abortions or you're talking about you know women that are now doing the iuds for birth control for whatever reason women don't really think about their Anatomy as much and they sort of just blanketly trust the science I have realized this when I speak to women about like I said the forms of birth control that they're using I think it's going to be a little bit harder of a sell for men I really do believe that men probably think about their parts a little more and they feel a little bit more present to them there is actually something that is that I was told is true I don't know if I'm passing this on as hearsay but doctors say that if something happens to a woman and they lose Consciousness and they wake up in the hospital and don't know where they are a woman's first instinct when they are are woken up is to say is everybody okay how are my friends like how are my family uh and a man's first instinct when they wake up after out of coming out of coma is to open the blankets and to make sure they still have their parts I was told that is true I don't know if I'm repeating this anecdotally but it sounds about right and so I do not think that this is going to be a very easy sell for Planned Parenthood but I could be proven wrong I could be proven wrong we know that we have some men that are going through and just getting their entire penises removed because they think that they're women but I call that mental disorder all right ladies and gentlemen that is all the time that we have for today the next portion of the show The Fun

this isn't even about whether you are pro-choice or pro-life i just do not like bad arguments and the arguments that are coming from the left right now are absolutely bonkers so let's start with absolutely bonkers joy behar it's a very interesting schism that goes on here because on the one hand sex sells everywhere i mean you can't see an aspirin commercial without somebody having sex you cannot turn on any program especially on streaming where people are having this there's soft porn everywhere now they encourage all of that it sells everything sex sells and yet when it comes to the reality of pregnancy this particular group of people on the right in this country and these religious zealots do not understand the reality of what happens when you have sex i don't think she knows that it's not pronounced but we'll pretend that there's an h somewhere in there for counterpoint number one i want to say yes joy behar you are correct sex is everywhere our culture is sick as an argument that's a diagnosis we have an increasingly sick culture here in america religious zealots and or people on the right very much understand that reality we understand that when a culture promulgates promiscuity it leads to people engaging in unfulfilling unprotected sex far from your assessment that we don't understand what happens when you have sex we understand exactly what happens children are the consequence life is the consequence it would seem to me that it's the atheist zealots the ones who have normalized sex-laden aspirin commercials that don't quite understand what happens when you have unprotected sex and then when they find out they go whoops well good thing i learned in health class that i can just get an abortion to deal with it did you know joy that before federally funded sex ed programs in school which sprang up in the 1970s and before roe v wade in 1973 teenage pregnancy rates in this country were declining over a period of 12 years maybe but we on the right understand is that there is such a thing as sexually transmitted insanity the normalization of non-committal sex which is pervasive in our culture and in our schools and it serves no one least of all the young women who wind up pregnant and are pressured to make a life-altering emotional decision that is packaged to them as the responsible thing to do i believe that you and the ladies

goldberg received a glad media award for executively producing a show called strut it was a transgendered modeling show she won the award for speaking up for trans rights and against those trying to roll them back oopsies this is why i love intersectionality here we are in the middle of a vicious culture war where a bunch of men playing dress up and trying to convince people that they are women and can give birth and they can chest feed and here comes along whoopi goldberg and she's so fired up about abortion that she accidentally tells the truth only women can give birth only women have a womb that is capable of carrying a child they say never get in the way of our enemies when they are making a mistake they also say even a broken clock is right twice a day i say thanks whoopi for proving that even idiots are capable of understanding basic biology and for the last counterpoint which i believe is so important in terms of this abortion debate we currently have a culture where men are routinely accused of not stepping up to the plate in fact just this week it was announced that only 18 percent of households in america today feature a nuclear family unit a married mother and a father raising children make no mistake father absence is one of the biggest if not the biggest epidemic that we face in this country today but why are we expecting menace up to the plate when we have women that are telling them that they don't have to why should men step up when the message that is ringing out loud and clear from mainstream culture and media is that beyond sex men have no responsibility or saving the lives of their children i mean how on earth can someone logically explain how a baby is 100 the property of a woman as it grows inside of her then the moment that the baby is born it requires a 50 50 split can a man stand before a judge at a child support hearing and say your honor it was her body and it was therefore her choice to have this child the answer of course is no obviously not that would be stupid if a man is colloquially referred to as a deadbeat dad for taking no part or responsibility in a child's life as he or she grows up then the same must also be true for a woman who wants no part or responsibility in a child's life as it grows inside of her my body my choice is a pervasive deadbeat mom argument that accomplishes nothing but excusing too many men from stepping up to their most important role as fathers thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you'd like to join the daily wires fight against the binding administration's

divided over the handling of the Kyle Rittenhouse case for today's Counterpoint I'm breaking down why he is innocent and how the media and FBI have allowed a teenager to suffer horribly to feed the BLM lie first let's take a look at what some of those media members said about Cal Rittenhouse Rittenhouse is basically what you would have had in a school shooter he's a 17 year old kid he shouldn't have had a gun he crossed state lines to supposedly protect property no he was going out to shoot people Kyle Rittenhouse the 17 year old vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse of vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse the armed teenage vigilante a 17 year old vigilante arguably a domestic terrorist picked up a rifle drove to a different state to shoot people Kyle Rittenhouse a guy who's deeply racist went with weapons to a black lives matter protest looking to get in trouble he did he murdered a couple of people Rittenhouse uh the 17 year old kid just running around shooting and killing protesters you see the 17 year old who was radicalized by trumpism took his AR-15 to Kenosha and became a killer wow wow wow I'll jump right into this Counterpoint number one they refer to Kyle writtenhouse as a racist and a white supremacist and that is really irking me in fact they repeated this lie absent any burden of proof because who needs proof when your job is a member of the corporate media is to brainwash the masses we know how brainwashing works right they just keep repeating a lie over and over and over again this Narrative of an angry racist white supremacist became so real for some people that when I defended Kyle Rittenhouse on my Twitter feed people actually came back to me and accused me of being anti-black I was called a race Trader for taking the side of a white teenager yep these people were so deluded by the mainstream media that they were shocked literally shocked to learn that Kyle rainhouse shot and killed two white people so Counterpoint number one is a really easy one for you guys you ready white supremacists don't kill white people this case literally has nothing to do with black people now for counter point number two I want to take a look at some of the responses from famous people and athletes and of course you know LeBron James had to jump right in watching the trial he laughed at Kyle Rittenhouse who broke down in tears and he tweeted what tears I didn't see one man knock it off that boy ate some lemon heads before walking into court laughing laughing laughing at this trial and actually of course there were real tears and I want to say this as Counterpoint number two it's really a question has this man LeBron James in any circumstance ever been on the right side of any issue the man who swears that black people are oppressed who happens to live in a gated 100 million dollar home in Bel Air the man who swears that white people are the oppressors who chooses every day to live in various all-white neighborhoods all around the United States the man who sells the black Americans we are suffering because of the residual effects of slavery Who as a sponsor for Nike personally Works to keep the child sleep industry alive in China yeah he's the sort of wealthy that doesn't even touch his own door handles or ever fly anyway but private but please believe that he is suffering because he is from stupidity now now I hate stereotypes but if ever there was a definition provided for a dumb athlete LeBron James is it all might no brain strapped straight from high school but credit where credit is due if there's any person who knows a thing or two about fake tears and acting it's you LeBron watching you drop to the ground in fake injuries every time a gust of wind passes You by in the court has really become an American Pastime we'll get back to the show

codecandis at checkout and for number three the Counterpoint really that language that they use to journalist radicalized by Trump they said and that right there is the Freudian slip now presented with the facts of the case during the trial has become more and more abundantly obvious to us all at Kyle Rittenhouse was persecuted by the media for no reason other than the fact that he happened to be a white person breathing leading up to Trump's potential re-election when the media became obsessive and parasitic and was willing to extract a race narrative from anywhere even apparently from a case involving only white people even in a case that dealt with a teenager who by the way could not have possibly supported Trump because he was below the legal age to vote I think the writtenhouse case represents the first time the media attempted to ruin the life of a 17 year old kid who by all accounts served his community and had never been in trouble all the while supporting by the way a literal pedophile and domestic abuser yeah did you know that the media is defending in this case the two people that were killed a literal pedophile and a domestic abuser they were willing to do that to satisfy their anti-white election time narrative so I'll wrap this up by making a simple wish I think our in-house will be rightfully found not guilty and then my wish is for Cal rittenhouse's legal team to dedicate the rest of their time for the rest of his life going after every journalist politician basketball player platform Network and individual who smeared him as a white supremacist terrorist I hope he sues you all into Oblivion for the rest of your miserable public lives thanks for joining me on this segment of Candace as you know the daily wire has begun a legal battle with the

and i was sort of shocked to see first off our city burned for six weeks because of george floyd protests nobody ever called that an insurrection um but i'm particularly interested in this department of justice piece because we then found out also a few months earlier we were told that maga supporters tried to kill gretchen whitmer and actually buzzfeed very left-leaning publication came out and said no actually this was fbi entrapment fbi plotted this they looped in maga supporters and they then said maga supporters plotted this so there's a lot of question marks right now i think for people about involved on both sides of the spectrum you know how involved is our department of justice in these events that they tell us our acts of domestic terrorism and in a trump 2024 scenario how do you address that as the president of the united states so i watched that a little bit and i said that's a strange deal going on with the kidnapping of the governor and it's got some weird answers coming out so i assume we're going to find out at least something about what happened you know it all started when i said somebody spying on my campaign do you remember that i put it out very innocently and i actually said i think that obama is spying on my campaign i turned out to be right that was right and then we've caught them and now let's see what happens with all of these people that got caught whether it's durham and what happened and what came out of there so far hopefully that's just very preliminary but even if you take a look preliminarily that's a terrible thing that happened they made up russia russia she was all a hoax think of it they're after people to put them in jail and yet they know they made up a hoax so they want to put people in jail for a hoax that they made up but here's the thing our our department of justice is implicit in all this right the fisa warrant like that is not a warrant that should have ever been granted so this is why i'm hitting at this because we're recognizing now that the corruption that we're talking about maybe we thought it was surface when you got elected now we're realizing that it runs much deeper deep seated and much much worse than we ever thought it was and and how do we get the americans to feel that faith has been restored in these institutions under your leadership well when you look at things how about the fourth man in the department of justice his wife is working for fusion gps writing bad stuff and you say what's going on there there's so many different things and it is it's very deep you know they say deep state i don't want to call it any specific name because when you say deep state they say you're a conspiracy theorist conspiracy theorist and i say uh well that's a little bit too bad now you have many many things and this is years and years of people being embedded through different presidents clinton bush look you say some of these people from the bush administration are almost worse than democrats i don't know if you know that but i think you do some of them and you least suspect it so in a way you don't have your guard up quite as much but we have some we have some real bad people we also have some very good people in all fairness we have some great people that hate what's going on and they do things about what's going on but i will say this we were cleaning things up and we we were cleaning them up at a racket rapid pace thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new

could it be that there are so many people tens of millions that still to this day after everything was wrong will say i don't care just tell me what to do right right and i think a part of that is that it's easier to listen and there's an element of that where people don't like personal responsibility you know personal responsibility is hard freedom is hard right and it's easier to blame all of your failures on well it's because of code because this person didn't get vaccinated or otherwise like we would have been doing this but i do think it's starting to go the other way and that the more that we showcase these videos around the world and people are starting to see wait a second this could very well happen here because my belief in the very beginning has been that covid was about um you know the spreading tyranny copen was about the government seizing more control in a radical way and that you know they never waste an emergency and it's and we're still dealing with the residual effects you still cannot get on a plane in this country without a mascot despite the fact that you can in europe right this is not about science anymore what happens when they try to re-implement this nationwide the red states just absolutely refuse ron desantis of course would refuse and we've got uh elections coming up where it looks like we could even have a republican governor in pennsylvania so these things they're doing might backfire on them my greater concern is i think people in new york california illinois and these deep blue states washington and oregon are going to just be like sure okay whatever red states are going to say absolutely not and then we're going to have hyperpolarization in this country it's resulting in people fleeing blue states to red states but that's that's also it's also problematic though because it is i would assume mostly conservative-minded individuals or libertarian-minded individuals who are fleeing from blue states to red states this means blue states become deeper blue red states become deeper red and then the polarization splitting this country apart just gets worse yeah i know i mean that that is what's going to happen but or you hope i think that what i've at least been seeing is that a lot of people that were more in the center are coming being pulled over to our side so it's actually not just there could be yeah there you go it's not just the conservatives that are fleeing it's just people that said hey man like i'm a old school liberal i don't agree with children mutilating their bodies i don't agree with any of this stuff you know and i want some say so in what my children are learning in schools and so they're in their moderates that are being that are now being called far right right yes joe rogan that's you and and joe's fairly left he was a bernie bro i mean i was i was uh i was adamantly in support of bernie in 2015 and 16. then i think bernie sold out but uh i think it was robbie starbuck who made this point that the things they're showing kids in schools if you went to the workplace and you showed this book to a co-worker you would be fired for sexual harassment right well and that's why i keep encouraging parents i'm like you i could get all of these emails from parents and they're like you know i've sent an email to the principal i'm like have you tried going to the police station because you're actually not allowed to do this if somebody showed this to your kid on a playground they would be arrested and parents haven't yet realized that and i think it's going to take that sort of a radical response because let me tell you if anybody shows anything sexual to my child in school mom's not calling the principal mom's calling the police and you are going to be charged as you should be charged for being a disgusting human being yeah there's a weird argument that's arisen where you know it's the martin bailey right they're saying but we just want our kids in our schools to understand who we are and it's like well you don't need to talk to them about sex to make that happen right and and the crazy thing about what's happening in florida this uh parental rights education bill there's a meme going around it's it's a map of the united states every state is blue except florida's red and it says the blue states are where grooming is allowed for all ages and florida is the state where grooming is allowed grades four and up i know it doesn't go far enough i mean i honestly don't think it goes far enough and that's what's so funny everyone's debating this uh this bill and i'm going actually my issue with this doesn't go far enough it should not be just until the third grade and suddenly they can start talking to you about sex you know how about you're not allowed to talk to my child about sex ever you know and and thomas soul does a really good job in his book of talking about the time before sex ed before sex education children were graduating high school the majority of them with their virginity and then suddenly there was this radical push in the 70s to say oh no we have to talk to children about sex and there was this lie it literally was a lie that was created they're just they're doing it anyways very few kids were actually doing it and then within the decade following that introduction of sex education which was sponsored by planned parenthood suddenly all the kids were doing it so sex education really isn't about educating your kids about sex it's about sexualizing your kids and because we weren't there for the beginning the genesis of it parents aren't really aware of the fact that the system has always been predatory it's just that we're more aware of it now yeah i think uh i think one of the issues we see here aside from the insanely egregious behavior that these bills are starting to uncover it's been happening for a long time and parents didn't know so it worries me as to how long things like this have been going on these books that actually show overt sex acts why is that being handed to someone to a child who's five years old and i will say the one thing that that's rising out of this which is going to result in more moderate and even liberal individuals voting republican whether for better or for worse is there they're seeing democrat personalities actually defend it and argue in favor of presenting four and five-year-olds with sexual information yeah i'm like these are these are these are five-year-old kids but i'll tell you i'll tell you you know what what this may be a hard thought for people i tweeted about it we talked about it on my show when they bring 15 year old girls in for a double mastectomy because the little girl these young women say that they're trans they don't feel comfortable in their body that's a permanent surgical procedure on a child would they give a 15 year old boy breast implants if he said that he wanted him yes yes i i wonder about it though because i feel like that's a question that might actually make parents question you you would you give let's let's talk about some of these other children who are hitting puberty blockers would you give a 12 or 13 year old child cosmetic surgery breast implants or something like that it seems like that's where the answer is yes and it's already been there by the way and this is why i say people don't see the weeds between culture like people can't make the connection of your child you know learning about sex in kindergarten and like why we're outraged about cardi b on stage the culture has become sick you know when she's performing wap and talking about her vagina right the culture has become sick we have a cultural illness right and it's working in conjunction with the classroom there's no separation there's no delineation between hollywood and what's happening in the classroom they're oh they're overtly sexualizing everything and making it seem like this is the norm it's not normal it's not normal to to have children seeing this when they watch the grammys you know seeing two women i'm referring to cardi b's performance that i was pretty outraged about we used to be able to watch the grammys and not see this sort of stuff this sort of a display so it's i think it's interconnected i do have good news for you though the future um in my opinion and maybe i'm just wrong i'm just some dude right is going to be way more conservative than conservative that's been in maybe 60 years the reason for it is not just that parents are seeing what's happening with their kids and saying you know no it's uh purely demographics in the early 2000s conservatives were having i believe 2.01 children per family and liberals were having 1.74 based on that alone you give it 18 years there will be more new conservative voters than liberal voters so you you wonder why it is these schools are so intent on this grooming indoctrination it's because the progressive left doesn't have children in fact not only do they not have children they're substantially more likely to abort their own children before they're even born right now the birth rate has dropped dramatically as of 2020 but conservatives still have a disproportionately large amount of children relative to the left so give it another 18 years and a lot of this stuff is going to be phased out so long as parents make sure they're going to schools they're watching what their kids are learning or they're homeschooling their kids or putting them in pod learning where their neighbors come and they they have like a local community school but if these parental rights and education bills succeed then the future is going to be is going to be pulled way back to the right now the left will scream and say oh no the far right it's like i'm talking about family values hard work personal responsibility i'm talking about any weird you know ultra traditionalist dictatorship but that's what they'll try and claim that if they can't sexualize kids in schools it's going to be you know indoctrination or it's going to be fascism or whatever but i think i think there's i think the future is going to be it's going to it's going to start pulling back the direction i think we're actually seeing that now with shows like yours with the the growth of shows like mine i'm not even i've never been a conservative in my life i grew up in chicago i was uh i was an arko punk when i was a young kid became more moderate and now i'm like you know i used to like watching bill maher and jon stewart but now they don't even pay attention to what's true anymore so i don't watch them i take a look at you know i explain it like if i'm sitting in the couch and i got a person to my right and a person on my left and i'm you know growing up leaning more to the left one day i wake up and the person on the left is just so far left they're out the building and i just don't even know where they are anymore i looked at a guy my right and i'm like i guess you're the only one here i can talk to because i don't know what they're doing anymore that's that's that that's how i feel as a working mother i take advantage of every opportunity to save time and

lgb and then they're like actually no lgbt they're like no actually lbgtq i stopped learning after the lbgt what these things mean lbgtqi and it's similar with their celebrations right so first it was the parade then it was like actually we need a whole day and then the whole day turned into a whole week and now it's lb gtqia month um so i guess my opinion is when is it going to become the whole year and who is behind extending this into perpetuity um of course i think it's foolish i think it's nonsense and a lot of it is driven by politics and it's not you know really about obviously anything that's actually happening in this country or real fear um so it's it's to me it's it's getting ridiculous and i'm not a huge fan of it but i tend to ignore it because there's randomly a

are some instances where I strongly feel the legal system is not fair to women and one such category where I see that is when it comes to stalking women that are being stalked and so I'm going to do something rare on the show and I'm going to strongly defend Kim Kardashian and all of her sisters I've seen a lot of these cases come up as it pertains to the Kardashians and I've stayed mum on them because I had a situation that happened with Maple chain to a stalker that I'm going to share for the first time now that we are years Beyond it but it was not fun when I was going through it but yesterday in the news Kim Kardashian received a restraining order against a man who believed that he was communicating telepathically with her she obtained the restraining order this is just her latest stalker by the way against a man named Andre Prasad and that was granted on Monday in La he's forbidden now from contacting her from coming within 100 yards of her he showed up at her home three times claimed to be armed and insisted that the two were communicating telepathically and she was worried that he could become physically violent that is terrifying terrifying just imagine in your home where you should feel the most safe you have a man that keeps showing up he's armed and he's saying that the two of you are communicating telepathically this man is obviously very insane and this has happened again over and over again to her her sister Kendall Jenner I've read cases her sister Kylie and we tend to sort of glean over these cases without giving it much so I go it's another stalker or famous person they deal with it like that's just a part that's just the price of Fame and it's no it's not just the price of Fame this is a mentally traumatizing situation to go through and Kobe Bryant's daughter has also recently been in the press for the same circumstance so she is 19 years old her name is Natalia and she claims that her stalker has an obsession with her and guns and has been living under the delusion that they are in a relationship and she says the harassment has been going on for two years and as escalating he recently showed up at USC which is where she goes to school creeping around the buildings where she takes classes and he even showed up at her sorority house what's especially scary is that he has been convicted of at least four crimes including one involving a firearm so you are talking about a girl on a college campus who has a man that is talking to her showing up where she lives and where she is taking classes this is a child I mean she's she's so young she's 19 years old you know I guess just became an adult but she's 19 years old and you should never have that experience that traumatizing experience simply because you are the daughter of somebody who was incredibly famous this is what happens people will see famous people online and if they are in fact insane they will convince themselves that there is some sort of relationship that they are having with them now I said I wanted to talk about this because I went through something a couple of years ago that it still traumatizes me but I'm finally ready to talk about it I'm scared to talk about it which is a part of it is a lot of of these women are under even more duress because the first thing that police officers tell you is not to say anything publicly about it because it could further set that individual off and that's a scary place to be in you're not supposed to talk about it you're supposed to pretend it's not happening and hope that the police are going to do something so for me it started about two years ago right before my son was born while I was pregnant I had a young man who went by two names he was schizophrenic who began sending me documents of his psych 5150 hold basically his discharge document from the hospital and he would write about 40 emails a day saying to me you know like I know Candace that I was in the hospital because you somehow convinced them that we weren't in a relationship you know that we're in a relationship you put me there how could you possibly do this to me you know what we have just truly believed that he and I had some sort of relationship and that he was in the hospital because I was lying to his doctors about their the worship that we had So that obviously instantly flagged me this I'm doing with an actual crazy person the emails became more and more aggressive I gave birth to my child he basically wrote to me and said I forgive you for you know accidentally becoming pregnant with another man and that we're going to raise this child together and everything's going to be fine and his personality would oscillate from extremely angry at me to extremely loving and telling me that he forgave me and he had convinced himself that every single thing that I wrote publicly and said publicly was directed to him so I'll give an example I could tweet something like only women can give birth pertaining clearly to the transgender a transgendered agenda and he would come back and write an email and say I saw you wrote this yes we're going to be happy and have children I could tweet something Trump 2024 and he would somehow see as if it was like a code between me and him he would somehow think that it meant signaled something to him that I had to communicate via code and it was increasingly bizarre increasingly scary and things really culminated when a this was right when I moved to Tennessee he began sending me emails again he had two names he had his real name and then a pseudonym and he sent me emails of a link to Eminem's song which you guys remember Stan needed that song with Dido and the video the song is about a crazed fan who convinces himself that he is receiving hate because he never gets an answer from this person he's obsessed with and then he ends up killing his wife and his child and he sent me a link to that and he said this is going to be our ending that was terrifying again we have the cops involved but the cops kept saying to me well there's nothing that we can do until he does something think about that there's nothing that we can do until we actually physically hurts you so him sending you this song and threatening to hurt you doesn't mean anything things culminated when uh after moving to Tennessee he sent me a photo of him with a gun on his lap and said that he was coming to me and it turned out that he had escaped his mental facility which was holding him now my understanding of the laws surrounding these mental facilities depending I think I believe it's state by state but where he was essentially they can only hold you for so long and this is because years ago there was a very liberal fight to end mental to end insane asylums now was there some rightful reason for that yes of course people were being abused and insane asylums we know that they were testing drugs on people that were clinically insane that our government was using them and experimenting on them which is horrible and horrific a lot of women that were in the same time were sometimes sexually abused so they put an end to insane asylums but then what happened is that people that are actually insane now are able to roam the streets freely so there are all these laws governing this person can only be held maybe for 30 days for 60 days and then you have to release them because these are the rights for mentally insane people well there are victims at the end of those rights for mentally insane people some people are actually clinically insane and should not be allowed to Simply roam free in society and send pictures of guns on their lap and say that I'm coming for you so once he left the mental facility obviously thankfully we were alerted immediately it made the press that he escaped and it was a very compassionate Post in the Press which was just you know we're looking for this person he may need mental help if anybody sees him and every single day where they did not find him I was living in a mental prison I have never I am not a fearful person I get death threats every day online I think most of those people are absolute Chumps you know who just don't have the courage would never have the courage to say things face to face to me but when somebody believes that they are in a relationship with you similar to what Kim Kardashian is going through what Kobe Bryant's daughter Natalia Bryant is going through it is another level it is they're not living in the realm of reality right and so he is trying to find me they don't know where he is is every minute I didn't want to leave my house I had an event I remember at Turning Point USA we were on high alert I didn't want to do a meet and greet I didn't want to see anybody because I was so fearful that what was going to happen to me would be similar to what happened to that former American Idol Star I believe her name was Christina grimey maybe it's a Christina Grimmie um and she was at a meet and greet and a fan stalker fan who was sending her weird tweets shot her and killed her and she died in her brother's arms and I just kept replaying that scenario in my head and was so paranoid in believing that I was going to die because I didn't know where he was and he was just going to shoot me in public and so that is when I got Security in place we were on high security alert but nothing there's no way that I can communicate to you how traumatic that is to to go through not only as a mother but as an individual as a woman just really believing you don't know where this insane person is he has sent you threats telling you was going to kill you and the cops are telling you if they can't arrest him and they can't do anything because he hasn't actually killed you yet right it's just a threat it's just an email there's nothing we can do and they were frustrated though I'm not trying to say cops are wrong here because they are just doing what they're legally allowed to do they're they're saying they are not legally allowed to arrest him for sending a picture of a gun in his lap and saying that he's headed towards me right and fortunately for me what ended up happening was they had guessed that he wouldn't be able to get too far because his mother and father were in communication not with him but with the police and said that he has no money he has no money how far can he really get and I'm thinking he can get on a bus you can get pretty far you can bum cash and get over to Tennessee and what ended up happening was that he went to a blood bank to donate blood in exchange for cash and they because they had him in the system he was captured there the police showed up and they took him back to wherever he was living in a mental home of some description who knows how long they can hold him there but they at least know that he is stalking somebody and that I will be the first one to learn if he ever leaves again makes me feel a little okay now that some time has passed but it's a scary thing to go through as a person a public figure because there are people that are actually insane and it is why I am not uh in support of the idea that there should not be insane asylums I do believe that a lot of women would be alive today if our legal system was better and if there were a place where people that are displaying very clear signs of clinical Insanity that they're not living in the same realm as us most as individuals now just end up on the streets these are the kind of individuals that randomly throw a woman into the subway station right throw in front of the train tracks and she dies like as what's been happening a lot in New York City there have been a lot of these random crimes from homeless people because if they weren't homeless these people would probably be in insane asylums so I did want to shift to also talking about a lot of issues that I see in the legal system as it

discriminatory uh that there are more black people in the NBA than there are white people black people just tend to be better at basketball and at Sports And so there's more black people represented in those spaces it's not discriminatory that the majority of people that are getting into MIT as an example uh which is based obviously around mathematics are Asian they just happen to be better at math than the other races in this country so there's the overuse usage of discrimination of the word discrimination when in reality what you're talking about is just that there are differences between

day crazy it's election day and then I randomly came across this clip of AOC and she's one of those people you know I have this little category in this box people that I used to not like but now I'm kind of enjoying right like Kamala Harris I think she is so implausibly stupid that I just always want her to be given a mic and a camera I love her I love her now I'm just like yep Kamala Harris what are you gonna say nothing you said made sense but you made my day a little better feel the same way about Meghan Markle like I used to hate her and now it's just like I'm having fun counting how many times she could be a victim AOC kind of liking her because she just says things that are just like what man she did a live on Instagram and she offered an apology now what was aoc's crime she doesn't apologize often what did AOC do wrong that she came off her high horse and apologized well she um she removed her pronouns from Instagram from her Instagram bio you know I'm not kidding to take a listen oh I'm sorry about that they used to be on there let me go in and check see if I can add them sorry about that they used to be there I guess they fell off but I'll put them on right now it's just what what are you apologizing for this is your bio you can put whatever you want you can put one word you could put no words at one point she was dumb enough to put her pronouns in there and then of course somebody that was even dumber than her noticed and was like oh my God could you please please please are you a human being I don't know please please please please please she's like oh uh and then so really I'm sorry about that they must have just fallen off what do you mean they just fell off what are you talking about walking down the street you tripped dropped your phone and then your Instagram bio pronoun just fell out what are you saying you know they slipped wet floor wet surface just slipped and fell off your what are you saying just own an AOC you took it off because it's dumb it's dumb that were you putting in our Pro you're obviously a woman obviously we should be referring to you as she and her because that's what makes biological sense but you gotta keep the stupid face happy and speaking of keeping the stupid bass happy obviously NYC has been hit with a tremendous amount of crime and you think there's just no way that anybody could try to manufacture the reason the reason being that there's too many police officers yeah I think that's what ioc is gonna do she's gonna try to tell us that that's what's going on let's take a listen a lot of people think that crime is up when we actually see that shootings are down when we see that huge indicators on on the most violent crime in New York City is down Subway crime is up but let's also note that Subway crime is up after they committed so many more officers to the subway system so that also tells us from a policy perspective adding more cops to the subway isn't solving this problem so there are other things that can solve this problem uh I'm sorry what first of all not a lot of people are thinking that crime is up violent crime is up all across the country and inner cities when you say that shootings are down do you mean from yesterday or from last week what are you talking about we've we've seen explosion of shootings in an explosion of crimes and the idea that it's the police officer's fault oh like okay first off be happy guys because there's less shootings today now the homeless people are just throwing people in the middle of the tracks and I don't know about you but I would much rather be thrown in front of a moving train than shot because um no actually I wouldn't I I would have a chance of surviving if I was shot probably a zero percent chance of surviving if I'm randomly thrown into Nova tracks by a crazy person now if by chance I am in the subway and I'm about to be thrown in front of the tracks by a crazy person I would sure hope there was a police officer there that could maybe stop this process maybe stop this crazy person from throwing me in the militias but no no I just want to point out guys that it's because there's too many police officers like I don't know about you but when I see a police officer in the subway station that's the reason that I throw someone in front of the train and if that police officer wasn't there then I wouldn't throw someone in front of the trade because I would be like okay I'm glad there's no police now I'm just gonna be chill and jump on you know the queue line or whatever thanks AOC you are a very special person

about it over the weekend and i think that at long last conservatives can declare victory regarding the slippery slope argument you know the idea that if you give someone an inch of rope they'll hang themselves with it eventually one inch down a slippery slope and you will wind up at the bottom we warned for years liberals and educators alike deemed that to be a logical fallacy just because we legalize marijuana doesn't mean we're going to ask for meth to be legalized except that's exactly what happened in oregon today as just one example possessing heroin cocaine meth and other drugs for personal use is no longer a criminal offense in cities like new york they've even created safe indoor spaces for drug users to shoot up our government supplies the clean needles so it took just eight years to get down that imaginary slope conservatives won liberals zero perhaps more recent in our memory is the long fought and one passage of gay marriage in 2015. two points that liberals made during that debate as it raged on over the years point number one us being gay doesn't mean we're going to make your kids homosexual we're not pedophiles point number two all we're asking for is the right to love two people who are in love should have the right to marry love is love and they told the truth by the way for about six months before lgb became lgbt became what is today known as lgbtqia and now all they're asking for is non-gender conforming restrooms no boys or girl science anywhere ever the acknowledgment that there are a minimum of 26 genders at least last i checked an occasional drag queen story time for biological men to be able to compete against biological women and for biological women to shut up about it that's all they're asking for bigot oh and uh the right to talk to your kids eight years and younger about their sexuality in the classroom yep now left-leaning politicians and advocacy groups are insisting that your children say gay in the classroom which is somewhat confusing for those of us that grew up in the 90s who were told by those same activist groups to edit that word out of our everyday lingo i mean when i was in elementary school i called everything gay locally especially my sisters you're gay ashley i would say oh so gay that was the cool hip slang when i was five until we learned that actually it was hurtful to homosexuals even though we were never aiming the word at them but using the word casually we were told don't say gay anymore and we didn't because it was no longer socially acceptable and the teacher is teaching that word oh no no forget about it in my day it wasn't even appropriate for teachers to be seen outside of the classroom i mean i once ran into my fourth grade teacher at the grocery store and i almost fell apart hi mrs longo what are you doing here outside of the classroom oh buying groceries like a regular human being likely story i'll be reporting this it was just easier that way in the 90s right teachers taught siblings fought but now everything has changed we've slipped right down proverbial slope and as i said now they want gay said everywhere gay gay gay gay gay and as much as that excites my inner child as much as i want to call up my big sister right now with an update yeah ashley you're gay again despite my inner child i know just like the overwhelming amount of people in this country that what we are really talking about is much more serious it's a fight from institutions for the right to speak to our children about their sexuality young children between the ages of five and eight years old don't believe me take a look teach first grade which means my classroom is one of the ones that will be directly affected do i lie and not talk about my marriage do i pretend i'm single do i invalidate my spouse's stance as a trans femme person the answer is yes to all of those things what we just examined is a mentally unstable adult predator who has access to children our children and there is only one kind of people who don't see it that way and those are other predators like disney a company which focuses its content exclusively on children they publicly announced that they are going to fight florida legislators on behalf of these child groomers in the classroom they will demand that these people like the woman that we just showed you has a right to speak to your child about her partner's trans feminists whatever that even means as if that wasn't bad enough a private meeting amongst disney's top executives recently leaked in which the animation director stated very clearly that disney has been quote so welcoming to my not at all secret gay agenda end quote yeah it turns out it wasn't ursula or maleficent captain hook or even scar in the lion king nope the greatest disney villain of all time is disney itself boycott them every park every show every coloring book because parents allow me to make this part perfectly clear to you what will follow this the intentional and overt confusion and sexualization of our children in the classroom is obvious pedophilia is around the corner and don't you allow them for one second to convince you that that's some imaginary fallacy that exists in your head the slope is real we must not give these freaks and predators so much as one inch hey guys i want to take a moment to talk to you about

bar at a 7-Eleven in Hawaii to right the wrong of his candy thefts when he was 14 years old so the story is that he finally exercise he was joking and said I finally exercised this damn chocolate demon he returned back in Hawaii to a 7-Eleven where he claimed that he used to steal a Snickers bar every single day when he was 14 years old and so what he did was he bought out all the Snicker bars and he explained an Instagram post and his family was quote unquote broke as hell when he was living on the island and for nearly a year he just would swipe a Snickers bar from a store uh as his pre-workout snack first off if it was for nearly year that's 365 Snickers bars a lot of Snickers bar I don't know if buying out all of the Snickers bars in one day is really going to cover that secondly I think it's supposed to make us feel good and we're supposed to go oh well he was poor so it's okay I was poor I never once stole every day from a store I just didn't do that so I don't really feel that way I feel like he walked in admitted that he committed a crime for a year when he was 14 it wasn't six or seven by the way a Snickers but what a luxury I have Snickers bars right now in my dressing room here it's a luxury they're like what would you like I'm like a Snickers bar because it's a luxury it's it's caramel goodness everybody loves everybody loves a stickers bar right but the idea that when I was poor the thing that I would steal if I was if I was trying to survive as if he was so poor like if he was stealing family like stealing food you know I sold Top Ramen we just needed dinner that night he said he was stealing a Snickers bar before his workout every day for a sugar high so I don't really know about the story I feel like a lot of kids go to prison for this sort of petty theft petty theft 365 times would have mattered to some person time but he's now the Rock and they're like oh my God we're so happy you're here and I don't find this to be acceptable so there is that this is supposed the story is supposed to make you feel good it makes me angry it makes me angry I'm sick of these celebrities getting away with everything The Rock should be put in prison whereas petty theft crimes so here's a video of him on Instagram just describing that theft I have been waiting decades to do what I'm getting ready to do now Hey where's your Snickers when I was 14 years old every day I used to stop here at the 7-Eleven and steal a king-sized Snicker bar because I couldn't afford to buy one that was my pre-workout food I did that for almost a year every day I had to come back and buy every Snickers bar on those shelves what's your name okay ring all these up excuse me [Music] nice to steal the Snickers every day [Music] you guys look look listen I'm trying to count all this I don't need to hear your stories go tell Oprah what do you guys doing you're welcome you want anything you got anything yeah that's just for you thank you so much I appreciate you I'm gonna leave these here if somebody looks like they're stealing Snickers giving me so they don't steal it thank you yeah mean I guess that story could make you feel happy he buys everything for everybody in the store and then he recounts how he used to steal a Snicker bar every day for an entire year and then he shows that photo of himself and he doesn't look like a starving kid and if you were a starving kid you wouldn't be going to buy a king-sized Snicker every day if you told me he was stealing for his family maybe I would go oh he stole Ramen because they just needed food to survive and then I would go this is beautiful but no this is a luxury Snicker Snickers bars are in fact a luxury alright guys next portion of the show is going to be available

twitter and the reason was because i sent out a tweet the tweet was ready juneteenth is so lame internet fireworks people were explosive they couldn't believe that i would say that candace don't you understand how could you how dare you candace you are a pawn i don't like juneteenth and i'm gonna tell you why i don't like juneteenth because i don't like things that are stupid that's kind of really it i don't like things that don't make sense i don't like things that don't even have anything to do with the history that it claims to represent if you're gonna talk about celebrating the emancipation of slavery weren't there some other more interesting dates that would maybe make more sense for example first and foremost of course it was january 1st of 1863 that president abraham lincoln freed the slaves in rebel states through the emancipation proclamation but we don't celebrate january 1st for anything other than new year's day we don't hear any chatter about the emancipation proclamation that would maybe make a little more sense but what about december 18 1865 that was the date that congress and the states outlawed slavery throughout the country with the ratification and proclamation of the 13th amendment that would seem like a perfect date if you wanted to actually celebrate freedom in this country but nope the left instead has landed on june 19th 1865 which is being called of course juneteenth where a very less significant event occurred a general by the name of gordon granger entered texas and announced that lincoln had freed the slaves three years earlier what that's what we're celebrating there is literally no historical argument to be made about why we would be using juneteenth or celebrating juneteenth as a federal holiday there's just no historical argument but of course there is a political argument there's always a political argument everything the democrats do and get crazy about has to do with something that they are trying to attain they don't care about black people they don't care about black history they don't care about celebrating they don't care about unity in fact joe biden actually said this he said that june juneteenth is quote a day in which we remember the moral stain and the terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take end quote how does it make you feel do you want to celebrate does that sound like a fun day to celebrate at least he's being honest right because that's it that is exactly what this holiday is about besides giving our do nothing government another day that they get to stay home what this federal holiday is actually about is constantly reminding black americans that we are somehow different that we are apart from the american treatment this is not our country that we should still be angry that things are owed to us that it's not okay it's all about emotional arguments you call me upon i'm calling you upon if you thought this was a good holiday if you thought this was about anything more than the democrats trying to keep us in a perpetual state of anger and fear juneteenth i'm going to file under critical race theory i'm going to file alongside the 1619 project all of these efforts are from democrats and they are meant to use black americans in their perpetual revolution because that's what it is it's perpetual revolution these marxist ideologies are essentially saying to the world that there will never be a fix no matter what already you're ready the politicians are saying juneteenth is not enough it's not enough there needs to be reparations there needs to be this there needs to be more it's never going to be enough do you get it wake up there is not any effort to actually solve things they want black americans to be the angry pawns that's why they decided to on this juneteenth erect a statue of george floyd wow that's how we're celebrating yes a statue of george floyd was erected in brooklyn new york on june 18th it's a giant block of his face with several quotes on it one quote is quote george floyd was hunted knees were used to pray yeah you get it you know what that's about an actual criminal a man who spent his entire life traumatizing black americans is now being honored and erected people thought it was a joke when i said this is where it would end of course george floyd they want us to think he's the hero my gosh what a brave man we should be honoring him we've gone from honoring martin luther king jr to honoring george floyd on june 18th don't you see what's happening it's the corrosion of values it's the corrosion of ethics it's making sure that black americans remain ignorant making sure we are not educated that we aspire to criminality in conclusion i've had a lot of time to reflect i looked at that trend and i sat down and i thought really hard about why it was i was trending for so long and all of the people that i had upset along the way and i just wanted to say to all of you that juneteenth is so lame", "_GDm6CbGoTA": "hello and welcome over the course of the next couple of weeks your social media timelines are going to be polluted with wide-ranging commentary regarding the recent and unprecedented leak of a draft opinion from the supreme court of the united states as you are likely very much aware by now the opinion laid out the court's intention to overturn roe v wade the decision which federalized abortion back in 1973. now after 50 years that decision is facing review under a conservative leaning court much of the commentary you're going to hear will pertain to the egregious nature of the leak it was indeed egregious and the necessity to track down the individual or the individuals who are responsible for passing those documents to the press i mean just who could be behind such an assault on our democracy surely that person must be brought to justice many will rightfully conclude that the person was an activist who wanted one thing and one thing only and that's mob justice the kind that would make even black lives matter rioters blush you think the george floyd trial and the brett kavanaugh hearings were bad well you ain't seen nothing yet they say there's nothing like a woman scoring but i'd like to offer an addendum if i've learned anything throughout my career covering politics it's that actually there's nothing like an un-woman scorned you've never heard that word before on woman and that's because i made it up it's a term that i use to describe what is left over after a predatory education system and culture have successfully made their way through the mind of a young girl carefully training her to reject and to fight tooth and nail against the very things that make her unique and powerful and ultimately happy femininity beauty fertility these are our god-given traits and oh my what a power they give us think helen of troy cleopatra legends and historical accounts of empires that have clashed and fallen at the bat of a woman's eyelash but since the 1970s when the federal government took over our school system young girls have been systematically taught to hate all of those things to view beauty and femininity as a perverse order established by men to put it simply girls are brainwashed now to fight against themselves against their biology and against the very things that make it all worth it like family like children i can tell you that there is nothing like the pitter-patter of my toddler's feet when i get home there's no greater music in life no greater reassurance by the way than the little kicks that i feel of my little girl growing inside of my womb right now i tell my husband that i already know her personality just like i knew my sons when he was growing inside of me my daughter already feels calmer more delicate more sensitive and she's a bit of a procrastinator i think like her mom unfortunately staring at screens all day is kind of built into my career i have to look at my iphone i have

media career that has never left me the comment was left under a video of me discussing all of the ills of feminism with radio host dennis prager i told him how despite all of the perceived glamour of my present life hanging out with kanye west invites to the white house introductions to former presidents despite all of that the best part of every single day for me is getting to come home making dinner for my family the beauty of domesticity which some women will never know bury in the youtube comments was one woman who expressed her gratitude i'm paraphrasing here but what she wrote was thank you for taking the time to warn women about the dangers of feminism i found out myself how much of a lie it was too late i am now 52 years old i am unmarried i am childless and i take pills every day to fight my depression her comment broke my heart and it's all the commentary that you need regarding what is about to happen next in this country because whether you are pro-choice or pro-life i hope when you take a look at the faces of the scores of rabid female protesters that are going to shriek and march and rage for days on end outside the supreme court building i hope that when you look into their faces you recognize the unwoman a woman that has bought into a lifelong lie and has as a result had every bit of life's joy stolen from her a woman who has nothing left to offer but rage and fear and the howl of loneliness only an unwoman who has spent decades fighting against her own fertility until suddenly realizing that it's no longer an option only she could be so hateful and so broken as to march for a perceived right to kill millions more infants in the womb that might sound harsh but it's true women fighting against children is unnatural and it's demonic the unwoman is unnatural and demonic pray for her pray for them pray especially for the younger women who are being brainwashed to become them pray that they all wake up before it's too late welcome to

regarding MK Ultra you know the CIA program that they allege has been suspended but kind of a proof in the errors that it wasn't suspended when the CIA was just openly drugging citizens that were unsuspecting of being drugged by LSD because they were interested in mind control and I was fascinated by the comments because a lot of you first and foremost didn't even know about it so I was just going how is it possible I thought this is to me almost mainstream information some of you guys a lot of you also said I it is so courageous that Candace is speaking out and talking about this the mainstream never talks about stuff like this and that was confusing to me I thought that this was something that everybody knew and then I started to realize I asked a few people here at the daily wire if they knew about MK Ultra and one person said it no the first one they heard about it was when I spoke about it and I realized wow wow there is actually a deficit of information of course I mean one acts as aspect of MK Ultra that we discussed was the fact that the CIA had invaded even college campuses right that they were funding College groups and so of course it would make sense that there was a relationship between our government and universities we know that they are funded federally but also they're going to make sure that what children are learning what students are learning is something that supports the state narrative that of course makes perfect sense right and so it would also follow that they're not going to want students to learn about government corruption of course you don't want students learning in a class about the classroom setting about how the CIA and the FBI have been involved in all sorts of horrible things against their own people every decade that's why it's amazing to me that people place so much faith in the Department of Justice I always ask the question give me one decade give me just a few years where there wasn't some Scandal that has been revealed about the CIA or the FBI now a lot of you were very concerned for me which also caught me off guard saying think oh my gosh Candace this is really dangerous stuff that you're talking about well guys I wasn't exactly reading from a dark website I wasn't down a rabbit hole I was the documents that I had on my desk when talking about MK Ultra was from history.com you know the History Channel History channel.com or whatever it is it was just I thought mainstream information but I'm now realizing that a lot of mainstream conservatives avoid these topics because they're fearful of being called I don't know what a conspiracy theorist and by the way there's an entire conspiracy behind that even the term conspiracy theorist allegedly came from the intelligent communities and it was so supposed to sort of ward off the scent if you're on their Trail Oh They'll call you a tin foil hat even when you are holding the Declassified documents from the CIA themselves the idea is making oh okay who cares you're crazy we said we stopped that program look the other way and so I'm thinking about this because obviously we recently also discussed zelenski this incredible Act of pretending he had no idea that it was Ukraine that fired the missiles that landed and killed two polish Farmers he pretended he had no idea and he called for NATO and the entire world to stand up essentially zelenski cult for World War III and my instant analysis was that he attempted almost a false flag attack Fair absolutely fair you're going to try to convince me the other thing which is that he had no idea that his men launched the missiles he had no idea what he decided to do video after video calling on everybody in lockstep to come help and and calling it an act of Terror from the Russians of course he knew that what he was saying was a lie or else there's somebody else that's in control of the Ukrainian military and making those calls of course she knew he was lying and so yes I do feel that an element of this was meant to be sort of a soft false flag that was supposed to inspire people to give NATO the permission to respond to Russia fully now the concept of a false flag attack now that I'm I've said that in a past episode I realize even that concept to people seems a little conspiratorial like why would you ever suggest that governments would be colluding to lie and to even potentially kill their own civilians or the civilians of others just to what effectively drum up public support right it's in propagandist effort to drum up public support and to say this horrific thing happened and now you all must acquiesce to the idea that we must go to war well that is something that we know is true we know for a fact that at the very least our governments have discussed it and tried to sign off on it in the 1960s they wanted to impart a bunch of false flag attacks against the American civilians because they wanted to drum up support across the American population against Fidel Castro so I'm going to tell you about another CIA operation again this is mainstream information you can Google this in your spare time I feel like that sets the bar you can Google or you can Wikipedia this so that should let you know that it's really present information that they just don't want discussed another operation at the CIA wanted to have taken place was called operation North Woods operation Northwoods was a proposed false flag operation against American citizens that originated within the United States Department of Defense United States government wanted this to take place in 1962 so that is when this was proposed the proposals called for CIA operatives to both stage and actually commit acts of violent terrorism against the American Military and civilian targets blaming them on the Cuban government and using it to justify a war against Cuba the possibilities detailed in the document included the remote control of civilian aircraft which would be secretly repainted as United States Air Force planes they also play with the possibility of the assassination of Cuban immigrants sinking the boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas also toyed with the idea of blowing up a United States ship and orchestrating terrorism in United States cities why didn't this take place because the proposals were rejected by President John F Kennedy if you want to know how that ends he was killed we don't know why but he did reject these proposals to take place in the to take apart to play a part in these false flag operations the backstory is Fidel Castro had taken power in Cuba in 1959 and began allowing Communists into the new Cuban government nationalizing United States businesses and improving relations with the Soviet Union which of course was a huge concern the 1960s the cold war is what we're talking about and so this was sort of capitalism versus communism that took place and to that end operation Northwoods proposals recommended hijackings and bombings followed by the introduction of phony evidence that would implicate the Cuban government it stated these are actually Declassified documents you say that the desired result from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere I'll read that to you again because I think that's really really relevant right this is from their documents the desired result from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere okay except several other proposals that were included within the operation Northwoods included real or simulated actions against various United States military and civilian targets the operation recommended developing a communist Cuban Terror campaign in the Miami area in other Florida cities and even in Washington which involved the bombing of Civilian targets themselves which was to be blamed on the quote-unquote irresponsible Cuban government to paint a false image of Fidel Castro and misinform the American public you should know that you should know about operation Northwoods because as I said this is available all you have to do is Google this this is not a conspiracy theory being woven by Candace but I felt that it was necessary to present this to you so that when I start to talk about things like what happened with zelinsky and I say that seems like a false flag you know that I'm not just saying that because I'm in conspiracy lands because I understand what our government is capable of and I know that if it wasn't for The Bravery of then President John F Kennedy who rejected these proposals who knows what would have happened would we have possibly uh Gone move removed the Cold War gone from a cold war to an actual War to actual combat because the American people would have been deluded by their mainstream media into believing the propaganda believing that we were actually attacked from Fidel Castro and in fact we were being attacked from the United States government that's a very scary thing to consider that they wanted this implemented and just so you know the plan was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and it was signed by chairman Lyman lemnitzer and it was sent to the Secretary of Defense like I said it was authorized by The Joint chief of staff and it would have gone through if it was not rejected by President Kennedy so tether yourself to that reality when you are being told that horrific things are happening and tragedies are happening overseas the reason why I really wanted to paint the idea they wanted to have Fidel Castro who obviously was not a great person so please do not take this as any defense of Fidel Castro absolutely not he had outrageous things to Cuban citizens which tends to happen in communist countries but the idea that they wanted to intentionally paint him as rash and as irresponsible I didn't like that when I considered what would have happened if we had believed zielinski's narrative is intentional lie of a narrative about Russians striking Poland it was so crazy of course the conclusion across the media had that lie not have been stopped in his tracks would have been that Putin was so rash and so irresponsible that even though he was using this war he was fighting this war in Ukraine and losing it he then was just going to throw some missiles over into Poland and just try to fight this war on or on on all fronts it's a very scary thing and it's why we have to get very real in discussing what is going on in that region and the only way that we can get real is if we tether ourselves to the reality that what is given to us via the mainstream media is intentional it is at the direction of the CIA many times we talked about operation Mockingbird earlier this week we know that they have that we have CIA journalists that are acting the place they have huge followings and we also learned earlier this week from a person that was in the CIA that they would intentionally leak bad information to well-meaning journalists it's important that you know all of that so that you have an appropriate relationship with the information that is being given to you by the Legacy Media all right guys the

like it's like it's dirty right it is a true addiction it is a mental addiction and it's not going to get better if we keep treating these people like the scholars of our society we need to have the

two different things there are people that like to explore what you know motivate someone to do something horrible and drastic and to kill somebody right and people who like Netflix did in terms of Jeffrey Dahmer wants you to understand the mind of a serial killer and there probably is some tale that leads people to be crazy there always is and it usually does come from within their own

hello and welcome ready who am I quote there's going to be no circumstance where you're going to see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy end quote yeah that was Joe Biden one month ago and those are words that are going to live on in infamy because that's exactly what we saw people being lifted off of rooftops in Afghanistan that's right Afghanistan has fallen to the Taliban but that is not the only thing that's Fallen so has the facade which facade you're probably asking yourself well you can pick one for starters how about the idea that the war in Afghanistan had anything to do with 9 11. 911 that time that we were attacked by mostly Saudis on hijacked planes so we started a war in Afghanistan because we had to find Osama Bin Laden remember yeah actually I do remember but he was a Saudi too wasn't he which is weird because we never went to war with Saudi Arabia despite the fact that 9 11 plane hijackers were majority Saudi and Osama Bin Laden the ringleader was as well Osama Bin Laden Yes we finally got him captured in 2011 in Pakistan wait a minute Pakistan did we go to war with Pakistan no no no don't ask too many questions the point is we captured Osama bin Laden but that didn't end the war or the wars now right because we let me check my notes we were still helping Afghanistan establish a democracy right just like we were let me check my notes again helping Iraq establish a democracy while we were there looking for the weapons of mass destruction that we never found either by the way is that what we were doing for the last 20 years in Afghanistan were we trying to convince the Afghans that democracy was best or were we trying to find and Stamp Out Al Qaeda wait I thought Al Qaeda were Freedom Fighters no wait I'm sorry I sound crazy right now did I say Al-Qaeda were Freedom Fighters because that's what they called them back then Freedom Fighters you probably forgot that part it was America that helped to establish many jihadist factions from 1979 to 1989. you're not supposed to remember that part it was called operation cycle and the CIA financed militant Islamic jihadist groups together known as the mujahideen with billions of dollars billions of tax payer money and weapons to help them fight off the Soviets because at the time the Russians were our biggest concern communism was our biggest concern we did not want the Russians to expand their influence into Afghanistan which the Russians had invaded so we funded radical militant Islamic jihadist groups otherwise known to the Pentagon as Freedom Fighters the Pentagon called them Freedom Fighters some were even invited to the White House you can still find these pictures online one of those groups was led by Osama Bin Laden who trained jihadist to fight in Afghanistan with the permission of our CIA but don't worry about that part so I'm not in part don't worry about that because after we got what we wanted after the Soviets left Afghanistan we changed our mind we realized that actually the Freedom Fighters sometimes referred to as jihadists were actually terrorists so Osama who was once a freedom fighter but then he was a terrorist who orchestrated a terrorist attack and therefore needed to be hunted down and killed so that we could finally still not end the war in Afghanistan that's not the point at least at that time we got the Soviets out of Afghanistan way back when thinking of which Speaking of which did you know as the American Embassy was being evacuated over the weekend an hour ambassadors fled Cobble do you know which Embassy didn't evacuate do you know which Embassy didn't flee the Russian one yeah no apparently they have a good relationship with the Taliban in Afghanistan so they stayed and they watched the fireworks this past week and meanwhile back home in America we're teaching socialism and communism in American schools are you guys following along me neither that's the point this is the convoluted military complex trillions of dollars and you don't even understand goal posts moved every year and you don't even remember why but I'll ask a question don't you feel safer how about Freer do you feel free since all this is started free at the airports when you're being treated like you're visiting someone in prison taking off your shoes taking off your belts masking masked out mask up Don't You Feel Free at school masking the children keeping them apart don't you feel free to open your business and be told that you're a selfish human being look all you need to know is that it's been 42 years of taxpayer-funded never-ending military interest in Afghanistan dollars and it was erased in a matter of weeks twenty thousand s need to be evacuated a country of Afghanistan and Joe Biden hiding in his basement again while Kamala Harris is refusing to speak to the press the facade has drops not like anybody ever believed you were a legitimate President Joe but I'm glad we don't need to mince words anymore you're a feckless sad excuse for a human being corrupted for decades when you are destroying our country you are a puppet oh and uh the Taliban releasing the prisoners you guys watching that scene prisoners that have been in cramped filthy cells all walking out and taking up arms and oh I could think watching this was how are they alive where are their masks have they been following the CDC guidelines the social distancing I thought that we were in an international pandemic that none of us are going to survive how the hell did all of these Taliban people survive in these prisons the people fleeing maskless jumping onto planes right now and Kabul trying to leave the country at the airport not a mass in sight which is weird because coping 19 is so deadly that we have to lock down the world it's a worldwide threat yeah that facade is dropping too left has turned us into a worldwide joke the facade of their Morality In preaching it's falling The Ugly Truth is being revealed beneath progressivism makes us weak progressivism makes us stupid do you think that those people by the way that are sprinting and jumping on planes dying trying to get out of Afghanistan do you think they give a crap about whether or not the military people are vaccinated do you think that would stop them getting on the plane you think they give a crap about whether or not the military men are allowed to pick their gender do you think they're going thank God Biden is discharging all the anti-trans agenda unvaccinated men from the military because I do not want them rescuing me yeah your little facade is

don't really care about politics did you have any political perspectives obviously you were pro-2a you believed in self-defense any other political perspectives that you held previously i was 17 i i couldn't vote but if i could have i wouldn't have voted for joe biden i would have voted for trump because trump was right he was he supported me from the beginning and he helped tell the truth of what happened right there to me i remember when they when they read the verdict and i was you know obviously very happy with the verdict and i was just so angry at the people like lebron james who were kind of feeding the scenario that wasn't true the amount of people that had so much power and influence who were watching the trial presumably because they were responding live to the trial and yet still lied i mean the trial it could not have been clear what happened they showed things in slow-mo you know they talked about who these people were i mean the the pedophiles that were killed that night people how anyone could believe that these people were out because they cared about black rights is beyond me obviously you have a bunch of criminals that know that no matter what when

in particular who you're looking at i mean has anybody offered an apology has there been anybody who said you know what actually after seeing the footage i got this wrong because that's always commendable if you if you believe the media narrative and then saw it live and corrected it but it seemed like there was a double down triple down quadruple down on the lies there were a couple people that came out and apologized said hey i saw the trial i was wrong who um i'm trying to think of their names i don't have at the top of my not uh top of my mind um but put your tongue top of your mind

does and i believe that the machine needs to be wrong again and we're going to be right right has the machine has there been any response to the machine did they just drop it entirely how have they tried to tidy this because they were so aggressive and on top of it and obviously in pursuit of mob justice which is what they were after like oh we've made such a big deal out of it they just have to put them in prison anyways because we've we seized this narrative and it's ours did they just sort of slowly back away or did they kind of still say oh this is just an example of injustice uh quite a bit of people continue to hammer down on that narrative um a couple of media organizations i want to call it media yeah propagandist propagandist organizations yeah exactly a couple people like that

who once called me a conservative charlatan many of you guys have been listening and following this beef on twitter people go when did you and megan mccain start beefing or i love the two republicans should never fight two conservatives should never clash well the truth is that i've never been a fan of megan mccain i think that she has been someone who has exercised authority over what it means to be a republican and what it means to be a conservative i'm not sure where that authority came from the open beef between us took place over vaccines honestly i've been proudly unvaccinated i did not see a reason to run and get a vaccine that was neither going to stop me from getting or spreading the virus just made no sense and and megan of course weighed in during that time and and said that everybody who didn't get a vaccine was just an idiot right so it started off with some twitter beef of her making comments that were about me and it sort of just went on and on her husband jumped an event eventually it's been a long saga well guys i am sorry to report that for the first time megan has gone through the extraordinary lengths to block me across all social media what was the final straw well it pertained to a back and forth regarding a book that megan mccain recently dropped called bad republican which was trending on twitter people mocking her because it only sold 244 copies i want to say something that i i think i am probably maybe the only person that genuinely does feel bad for people children of the rich i do actually believe that rich kid problems exist and that they struggle in society because they grew up so wealthy and have had everything handed to them throughout their entire lives megan mccain by the way is such an example of this and i'm going to take you through her resume so megan attended columbia university she earned a bachelor's degree in art history she originally planned to become a music journalist and she interned at newsweek and saturday night live you let me know when you hear something that sounds conservative or republican throughout this she then launched a blog during the 2008 presidential election called the mccain blogette and she documented her father's presidential campaign it was at that moment that she decided to switch her party affiliation so yes she was a registered democrat until her dad decided to run for president and she said she did so as a quote symbol of my commitment to my dad okay so it was symbolic for her to transition into the republican party it was not based in ideology was not based in morality it was simply this symbolic measure that i'm going to be republican because my dad is running for president and i want to show him that i believe in him in 2008 she published her first book and which was entitled no i am not kidding my dad john mccain so this is how she's entered the world stage she's i'm the daughter of john mccain and so people should somehow listen to me i've changed my party to show how faithful i am to my father uh she began writing in 2009 for the daily beast i cannot think of a more left-leaning publication and she wrote an article that was entitled my beef with ann coulter which went viral questioning ann coulter the very much conservative and very much republican author and commentator who you guys are familiar with and this really has been her career attacking republicans pretending that she has the upper hand she attacked laura ingram she attacked karl rove um it says here that in a may 2009 episode of the colbert report does that sound conservative to you she also criticized bristol palin's sexual abstinence saying that it's just quote not realistic for this generation she then wrote another book it was a campaign memoir reflecting on her dad's campaign entitled dirty sexy politics that was published in september of 2010 and in that book she expressed that the republican party seems to have lost its way over the last 10 years so let's just very interesting it's in 2010 she was reflecting but she had just become a conservative in 2000 a republican pardon in 2008 but she already had enough experience in her two years of republicanism to reflect on the party as a whole and decide that they were getting things wrong and that they had all lost their way as she spent her career simply bashing conservatives all of this culminates in 2015 when she signed on as a fox news contributor and then of course most notoriously she was named in 2017 as a permanent co-host of the abc daytime talk show the view another left-leaning show i can't at any point when i look through her resume and the things that she's done understand how it's plausible that she has become this voice this authority to keep disrespecting conservatives people that have worked their entire lives to get into the rooms that they've been into and so i've she has always frustrated me summertime is upon us ladies and gents and that means that it's time to grill i love to

critique trump and his supporters during a moment that meant a lot her hate for trump and trump's family and ivanka to me trump's her concern for the country as a whole i just i do not view her as an actual republican but just in case you think that she's been using her dad's name to get everything that she's ever had in her life we put together this montage for you or rather we're sharing this montage that someone else put together on the internet of her talking about her dad in various interviews please know that each time she says this if you're listening to the podcast and not watching this it is a different conversation here you go take a look father my father my father my father my father my father my father is my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father's my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father and my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father's my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father's my father my father my father's my father my father my father my father's my father and my fathers my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father my father and my father my father my father my father my father my father i am john mccain's daughter whoa she is john mccain's daughter i just want to make that clear in case it wasn't clear by her book called my dad and then her going and saying my father this really was her entry into every conversation you had to listen to her you have to shut up because her dad is john mccain and somehow she believes that that transfers his accomplishments to her and it it's stunning to me it shouldn't be surprising to anybody but it's stunning to me that she hasn't yet realized that you don't get to authenticate your experiences and your ideas by just saying this is what my father has done she did something over the weekend i simply shared a photo that she shared on her instagram multiple photos to promote her new book and that to her was a final straw she wanted to say you know i don't know why i'm trending on twitter people were attacking her they were mocking her i should say not attacking her mocking her for the abysmal book sales and then mocking her even further for actually doing this as a photo op look at this picture if you're listening right now it is a photo she's holding her child and she is standing over her father's grave now if you think that that's bad enough taking photos in graveyards to me it makes me a little uncomfortable but she has strategically placed her new book bad republican at her father's gravesite this was a photo op it was a means to still use her father's name to sell books and say oh well you should buy this book because don't you forget my dad is john mccain i think this is so tasteless and so crass i could never imagine doing this in a million years and i view her as an example of somebody who is a toxic woman she is a she's a toxic woman she treats other people poorly she believes that she's allowed to be in the room on the basis as i said earlier of her father's accomplishments and that just isn't the way that it works so megan to you i am happy to let this beef go now that you've had me blocked but i think that if there's any person that has given evidence of being a conservative charlatan it's you it's your entire career and i will not accept it i will not accept you attacking various conservatives pretending that you have a right to do that on the basis of who your father was and how he lived thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and

than Democratic Leadership they seem to be Satan worshipers to me I can't even respond to that you're saying you're correctly identifying a problem that our society is not reproducing and why is that

know people understandably well you know it started off at 6 trillion now it's 3.5 trillion now it's going to be 2.9 it's going to be zero zero because in the in that plan that i put forward and i said from the outset i said i'm running to change the dynamic of how the economy grows i'm tired of trickle down the trillionaires and billionaires are doing very very well trillionaires okay trillionaires are doing very well also 3.5 trillion is going to cost zero are we smarter than a fifth grader you know it's bad when even the washington post is calling you a liar for this but you're gonna go for it anyways hoping the general population is too stupid to figure out that yes everybody is going to pay more and the lie that you're attempting to peddle i believe is that rich people are going to pay for it you'll just tax the rich people more because rich people aren't paying their fair share i personally love that one it's my it's the best myth because it's been around forever it's like the loch ness monster the chupacabra rich people are not paying their fair share is political folklore the truth not as fun but the top 10 of earners pay 71 of all income taxes but 71 of all income taxes is not enough apparently they have to pay more in order to help poor people right wrong there is this little thing called history something which we can look back to tell us how the economy reacts to theft because that's exactly what you're suggesting you're suggesting that we should steal you're suggesting socialism you're suggesting that we can steal our way somehow into national prosperity but history tells us otherwise in fact history reveals that even rich people have a point of no return under woodrow wilson's administration the idea of just tax the wealthy was pioneered and what actually happened was that rich people stopped spending they put their money in tax sheltered accounts and tax-exempt municipal bonds it actually led to less tax revenue for the government less jobs and less income for poor people but in the years following that administration when they lowered the taxes on the rich the rich actually paid more in taxes there were more jobs and there was more income this trend has been proven time and time again across many administrations jfk ronald reagan and george w bush it is a fact that when tax rates are cut for the rich the poorer and the government get richer chalk it up to human behavior when people feel as though they are being treated fairly and are not being robbed or scammed they are more inclined to spend their money they are not inclined to find ways to legally tie up their cash history also teaches us exactly what happens when we try it your way though joe the hugo chavez nicholas maduro fidel castro away we can tax the rich people to the point of criminality only until they leave the country and we're left with people that are starving impoverished and attempting to swim to freedom let's watch the rest of the clip you have the uh the whole notion of being able to provide for daycare for your children getting people back to school etc it's all paid for it's all paid for but a lot of these are flat tax cuts that exist within my proposal and they're being calculated as if the cost of of the child care tax credit is a cost to the government it's not it's reducing taxes reducing taxes not increasing taxes i love that free day care free college free free free hey if college is free then everybody will go including the people who definitely shouldn't by people who put zero effort into their academic learning in high school you know what they need just a few more years to give no effort while they party and drink on taxpayers dying listen joe you are pretending right now to care about families and i love it the party that single-handedly and intentionally created the current epidemic of family breakdown the single motherhood crisis via welfare programs is now offering more welfare because you want more control over our children more years to brainwash them more years to convince them that more government is the answer to their every problem more critical race theory more pick your gender nonsense more dehumanization of two-year-olds by abusively forcing them to sit behind a piece of cloth for six hours a day more government priming for totalitarianism and so with as much respect as i can possibly muster for you joseph and on behalf of parents everywhere who are currently pulling their children out of these indoctrination centers allow me to say hell [Applause] no but we're not going to end there because joe biden never never gets through anything without saying something hilarious so take it away joe now part of the problem is i had hoped i hadn't planned on all i kind of anticipated might happen i hadn't planned on the uh 178-mile top winds hurricanes going to louisiana and 20 inches of rain in new york and new jersey and and an area as big as the state of new jersey burning down in the west and so what i had hoped i would be doing but i'd do what i did in the campaign i'd be out making the case about what my planned proposal contained ah that's what it was it was the rain and the wind and the fire that stopped joe from being able to travel and talk about what his plan entailed yes the weather is keeping him from getting in front of people because everybody knows that weather anywhere is weather everywhere i mean i was going to come to work today but there was a blizzard in antarctica i was going to rake leaves in the front yard but there was a tsunami in japan so joe can't go anywhere but to his home in delaware on the weekends because of some weather somewhere but he wishes he could just like during the campaign where he also went absolutely nowhere he hid except for maybe that little 20 car honking at him thing that they did in the parking lot he pretty much hit but 80 million votes guys we just haven't seen him in front of a single crowd all of which are currently chanting f joe biden at every chance they get because of kovid because of climate change honestly joe if america was half as brain dead as you are we

begin every episode with a question of the day but it seems that the questions are coming to me the big one being why did Candace Owens and Kanye West wear white lives Matter t-shirts last night at his Yeezy season 9 show here in Paris I'm still in Paris here is the shirt by the way if you're listening you can probably find it anywhere online it seems to be broke the internet but if you're watching here it is the notorious white lives matter shirt which has inspired a meltdown a breakdown for some people I think my question is why why did this t-shirt or our t-shirts Inspire such a meltdown for so many people I'm going to talk to you about the breakfast that I just had with yay and some further remarks that he made on his Instagram all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] all right guys before we continue I want to take a quick second to talk to you about Birch gold in this unpredictable economy it's extremely important to protect your savings from big

texting Candace to 989898 now alright guys it is true the internet is broken you cannot use the internet today it's not working anywhere in the world because I wore a t-shirt alongside yay West Kanye West which red white lives matter and God forbid God forbid you wear a t-shirt that says white lives matter we wore this for his easy season nine fashion show here in Paris and people are upset they're very upset about that they're going why on Earth how could you how dare you wear this shirt how dare you make a mockery of the BLM movement in addition to this in case you missed it on Kanye West's Instagram page he wrote this everyone knows that black lives matter was a scam now it's over you're welcome that is the only response or the only thing that he has said publicly about wearing the t-shirt and you obviously know if you're watching this where I stand on the black lives matter movement in fact I'm doing an entire documentary to expose the fraudulent nature of that movement and the organization that stood behind it and benefited billions and billions of dollars uh because they elicited elicited black grief they sold black people a concept of their oppression they used poorer black Americans as a marketing firm for their organization and where did that money go well certainly not to Black America so I had this wonderful thing this morning this wonderful experience and I'll tell you why it was wonderful I had breakfast with yay um at his hotel and it was wonderful because it was one of those moments where I realized how far I've come from where I was the first time that I ever came to Paris ironically I was having breakfast with a woman whose family I worked for and she was so awful to me now never forget this moment because it almost ruined Paris for me it was a wealthy woman who told me as we sat in her hotel which was The George senk Hotel she said Candace a girl like you shouldn't even be here look how expensive The Omelette is that you're eating do you see how expensive it is at almost 35 dollars a girl like you can't afford this hotel or you can't you can't afford to stay here and I remember I was so upset that when I left that breakfast I was crying because I was so angry that anybody had spoken to me like that and fast forward I guess more than 10 years now and I am sitting at a hotel with having an omelette by the way with yay West and we are discussing the internet which we just broke over this t-shirt I just started jotting down some things that he was saying because he was actually giving an interview uh to another magazine and he said I perform for an audience of one and that's God I love I loved that statement so I wrote it down he also said quote Utopia is possible for it not to we are being led by I'm going to say that again Utopia is possible for not who we are being led by which of course leads me to think about black lives matter again and these people who claim to be leaders and knew that what they were doing was further Dividing the Masses I mean the whole idea here via the black lives matter movement was to make sure that black people saw oppression and saw white supremacy surrounding them and convincing them that if they leaned into this narrative that somehow their lives would be better it was a mirage actually that's a a word that yea used during the breakfast too it was basically a mirage right this idea that somehow all we needed to do was burn down our own neighborhoods all we needed to do was have our youth wearing a George Floyd t-shirt all we needed to do was loot targets and loot these expensive stores and somehow Justice would be delivered and of course it wasn't there is a deep irony and a sad irony when you consider that wearing a t-shirt has led such a Tremor throughout the world right a t-shirt that says white lives matter which should be implied right White lives matter black lives matter Asian lives matter it should be implied yet people are angry and they are being vicious online because they can't believe that we have the audacity to detract from the movement which is a lie right black lives matter if black lives matter then some of these things that we have been talking about on this show things I've been talking about throughout my entire political career would be getting attention not the T-shirt right not the T-shirt but these actual statistics that matter and here are just a few of them one hundred and seventeen thousand six hundred and twenty six black children were killed by surgical abortion in the United States in 2018 right those are recent statistics just so we are clear abortion in America has contributed to the greatest decline in black population since the first black slaves arrived you will hear people often talk about um lynching it's just like a new thing they like to they like neoliberalism they could talk about lynching and they compare everything to lynchings it's just like being lynched Lynch Lynch lynched well for your reference you should know that 4467 people in the United States were victims of lynchings from 1883 to 1941. 3265 of those people were black and you keep talking about lynching as this horrific thing that's happened in the past right and yet when you say to people today that 20 million black infants were aborted they don't even blink and I don't even bat an eyelash no no less than batting an eyelash they tell those same black people that they need to be outraged when a Planned Parenthood Clinic shuts down 20 million when you talk about people that are killed in the millions and you talk about the Jewish Holocaust when you talk about the Rwandan Holocaust people are oh my gosh oh my this is a heart of course because it is horrible but for whatever reason since we have convinced ourselves to genocide our own offspring nobody cares nobody cares they don't bet knowledge in fact they tell you that it is your rights so think about that 20 million black babies and yet a t-shirt is what got attention last night in 2012 more black babies were killed by abortion in New York City than were born imagine that your abortion rate being higher than your live birth rate in a city and they celebrate it do you remember notoriously the governor lit up the city pink when they talked about expanding abortion rights expanding the black genocide light up the skyscrapers pink it is a win a win for who though is the question a win for who 79 of Planned Parenthood abortion facilities are located within walking distance of neighborhoods that have a higher proportion of Latina and black women but that's not the only thing that's killing Black America literally we also know obesity is killing Black America I wish you know what we should have done we should have put a white lives matter t-shirt on lizzo maybe we could have gotten a lot of attention about obesity and how it's actually killing black Americans obesity is the number one killer in America okay I know black lives matter told you it was police shootings right it made you think that thousands of black men were dying at the hands of police no no absolutely not I think in the year 2020 was it nine unarmed black men were killed by police nine of them but obesity is killing people at a very high rate and black women have the highest rates of obesity it's the number one killer and of course we sit at the top of it black women 56.9 percent of us are classified as obese we shouldn't talk about that you know why because it didn't have a t-shirt on it that said White lives matter talk about criminality no one wants to talk about it if you're not talking about a police officer right people don't want to talk about the fact that black people are slaughtering other black people people don't want to talk about black on black crime it doesn't matter because we're doing it to ourselves right just like we're aborting our own babies applaud it applaud it in fact put it in the music put the criminality in the music and celebrate it give it a Grammy give black criminality a Grammy so that we understand that this is ours sit in the cool Club right now we know what it means to be black now we know what it means to not be a traitor to your own race murder your own race and if you don't do it in your womb grab a gun kill the guy next to you Applause all around the world per the CDC African Americans are four times more likely to be killed by a gun than the overall population and once again it's not a white person that is pulling the trigger it's another black person we account for almost 40 percent of all of the homicide offenders in the United States 40 percent coming from the smallest piece of the population we're talking about this what seven percent of the population is black men and they're accounting for 40 of all of the homicides in the United States but let's not talk about that in fact let's call that racist to even acknowledge that truth to talk about the ills in our own Community that's racism let's just let's just move on for it people love to talk about the incarceration rates right because the incarceration rates allow you to understand the results without ever having to talk about the problem right you don't have to talk about the equation I'll just give you the answer black men are incarcerated right it says here that there are nearly five times the rate of black men in prison than white people oh perfect narrative it must be racism no has nothing to do with the fact that we're the most murderous group in America has nothing to do with that of course one plus one equals too but let's focus on the two and not the one plus one let's focus on everything except for the fact that we also know that these individuals that are ending up in prison or these individuals that are ending up killed or these infants that are being taken out of their mother's own womb they're all coming from broken families families that have been strategically broken down in a culture that promotes further promotes the breakdown of family that corrodes the value of women that corrodes the value of men but hey that wasn't wearing a white lives matter t-shirt so who cares who cares who cares if 20 million black babies are dead who cares a path of our black men are locked up who cares if black women half of them are clinically obese and spelling out their own death sentences who cares if we represent 40 of all homicide offenders it doesn't matter because we didn't put it in a black lives matter tea you know what else does it matter it doesn't matter at all the education statistics don't even pay attention to the fact that 74 of black boys in California can't pass a basic reading exam you know why because we love ignorance we should celebrate ignorance right who cares that across five schools in an inner city like Baltimore they couldn't find a single child that was proficient in reading and in writing who cares who cares that three out of four black boys in California schools cannot meet writing standards who cares it's not in a white lives matter t-shirt so we won't talk about the fact that nearly 80 percent of black boys in the fourth grade failed to meet state reading standards none of that stuff for whatever reason resonates no one's ever outraged it never Trends on Twitter last night White lives matter was trending on Twitter because Kanye West had the nerve and the gall to put that t-shirt on White lives matter now now the Press how dare you how dare you what a form of engaging in white supremacy none of this that I just read to you is white supremacy but the t-shirt is a form of white supremacy you know what the problem is the problem is not what's happening inside the households or what's happening on the streets or the slaughtering that's taken place the problem is not the women that have been trained to kill their own offspring not to raise their sons the men that are on the streets killing one another and putting out music that encourages their offspring to do the same the real problem in Black America is that Kanye and Candace found a white lives matter t-shirt so let's focus on that instead and that's all I have to say about that okay guys before we continue I want to talk to you about front page magazine founded by conservative writer David Horowitz front page magazine has spent over two decades combating the radical left's efforts to destroy America there are two new podcasts the right take with Mark Thompson and the Jason Hill show offer riveting interviews and insightful coverage of politics culture and current events it takes a village to combat the radical left's effort to destroy America that's why as a fan of my show you should also check out these guys over at front page magazine by visiting frontpagemag.com and while you're there you can support their cause by making a tax deductible donation inside every Progressive is a totalitarian screaming to get out and no one understands that better than the team over at front page magazine go check out frontpagemag.com today do you know what else I uh said to Kanye over breakfast I was saying to him that when I look at people and when I speak to people I actually acknowledge that so many of them are just Bots when I say Bots I'm not talking about Instagram Bots or Twitter Bots I'm talking about individuals who are so clearly programmed like it's like an algorithm and they all have the same algorithm they're like Droids that are walking around in society BLM check you know what I mean the little flag the Ukraine flag check the the LGBT flag and they're all just the same person being processed over and over and over again and that's how you know that the system is feeding them information and they don't even realize they don't even mean they don't even mean to be vicious and angry because they are they've just become the algorithm right these people are quite literally responding to an algorithm that has been decided for them that has been programmed into them and that is how I feel right now as I'm taking a look at some of these comments it's they don't even realize that these comments are not their own these aren't their own perspectives these are perspectives that are passed around the world old and they think it's their own if one person who said regarding us wearing the White lives Matter t-shirts last night this is Eaton Thomas he said the reason why there was no need for you or Kanye West or anyone else to wear a white lives matter shirt is because never in the history of this country has the value that America puts on White lives ever been in question okay so why are you mad when we wear it Eaton why are you mad what are you upset about if it's not even a question then why are you bothered why did it ruffle your feathers if it's not even a question right if the air I read is not even a question I don't protest when somebody is just breathing air you have Darren trank who wrote Candace you don't get that you're just undermining a movement by imitating their name and logo You're simply not worth anyone's time no Darren what you don't understand is that I intend to undermine the movement that's what I've been doing I've been undermining the black lives matter movement because I'm not an idiot and it's clear that the result of the black lives matter movement has been more Destruction for black lives it is clear that black people are being programmed in the same way that you have been programmed to think that the movement is for you when it's not it has stripped our communities further the places where these riots took place are further impoverished black people did not become richer since the George Floyd riots they actually factually became poorer the poverty rates for black children and black adults has gone up since the black lives matter riots oh but at least you got to put the black lives matter logo in your profile didn't you Darren what is it the little is it the fist pump I intend to undermine the movement onto another Droid Candace another deflection this country doesn't have a history of treating White lives like they don't matter okay well black people have a history of treating black lives like they don't matter and now we have taken on the DNA of it right we are basically saying and this is crazy because another point that I made is that the n-word right something that you're not allowed to say unless you're black which I want to read you the history of the n-word so the n-word actually used to have a definition it used to have a clear definition of an ignorant person it was not an ignorant black person but any person that is tremendously ignorant was considered the n-word so of course they referred to Slaves who were ignorant because they were not allowed to read according to slave codes right they were not allowed to become learned individuals or to become further educated they refer to them as the n-word now recently I just found out they've updated the definition of the n-word if you look it up I did this morning and when you read the definition it says it's an insult to black people so we've actually now expanded the definition to mean just black people in modern times not black and slave back in slave times but in modern times now we say the n-word is just meant for black people and I came across this article in the New York Times that made me laugh it's so Preposterous it made me laugh and it so embodies the circumstance that black people are in today again this is a quote from the New York Times 1998. it says the word N word has been used in America since the 18th century as an offensive insult but pronounced [\u00a0__\u00a0] it can also be used among some African Americans as a term of endearment oh okay so it's like the first portion of that is for people that are smart and educated right the n-word has been used in America since the 18th century as an offensive insult okay cool but if you're stupid right and you're ignorant and you actually embody the n-word then please know that you can use it as a term of endearment once again we have a circumstance where we are being sold back our own oppression and told to celebrate it I see it over and over and over again black people are being taught to embody the n-word even down to the literal n-word we are being told this is cool say it say in your parlance so they used to call you it but now we want you to call yourselves it and we do it by God we do it in our music in fact we are so proud of our usage of the n-word that we yell at people if they're not also black and saying it right we're like no that's no we are the ignorant ones only we are allowed to say this words I have to imagine that there is some alternative Universe where people are just sitting back laughing like they're playing it's almost a video game at this point they're sitting back and they're thinking okay no way okay here's what we're gonna do ready it's it's like practical jokers or uh Ashton Kutcher in punked in MTV they're sitting in a van and we're like do you think that you could get black people to actually say just call themselves the n-word no no no way they're not that stupid they're not yeah oh my God they're doing it they're actually doing it they're saying the end they're calling themselves okay okay I'm gonna level up here do you think that you can get black people to not only call themselves the n-word but to be mad if anybody else says it outside of them like they're it's just their word oh my God oh my God but they're actually doing it and the same people that are sitting in this truck punking Society just seeing how far Black America will take it are just upping the ante it seems every day I go back to what I said earlier right obesity they're sitting in the truck and they're like okay lizzo is fat lizzo is very fat lizzo is obese and obese is very obviously the number one killer in society do you think that we could get her to be proud of being fat and to tell other people that they should be proud to be fat no no no no should we see if she will go as far as to have a Netflix docu-series of her having a bunch of other fat people compete to work with her no way she's going to do it oh my God she's doing it she's doing it they're proud to be black oh I mean they're proud to be fat she's on stage as she did a couple of weeks ago accepting a trophy saying how when she was growing up she never saw people that were fat like her and now she's proud because she's receiving an award in fact I bet the people that are in this little punked band are creating the awards okay let's award them every time they do something that is harmful to themselves I know what we should do let's give cardi b a Grammy she barely even speaks English I know I know she just like makes noises what if we gave her a bunch of followers and promoted her and had her further denigrate the language tell people to be proud that they're ghetto make them think that it's cool that it's popular do you think that we could do it yes let's do it and so it goes that's what's happening somehow the people that I I have to hope are playing the biggest prank on Black America have trained us to say the N word have trained us to celebrate to celebrate obesity have trained us to celebrate our lack of Education by giving us a bunch of false Idols have trained us to think that gang banging is cool right it's in the music it is now in the music that kids are putting in their ears and they put on a pair of headphones and so they ignored the fact that last night Kanye had a bunch of children running around singing in Latin singing Christian music singing things that were good that were productive for the future they ignored all of that at his show last night and they instead focused on the White lives matter messaging because they said you know what God forbid black Americans get an idea that they could be something other God forbid black Americans get an idea that these things that we are programming within their society are actually harmful no no no let's turn Kanye West into Enemy Number One that's what's happening and it pains me to see that people still don't get it it wasn't Kanye West that put the White lives matter t-shirt on first you did you did by intentionally ignoring what black lives matter would actually mean if it was applied it would mean taking a look at all of these statistics that I've just riled off to you it would mean taking a look at the real problem that is happening which is our culture a celebration of perversity pitched to us as if it's diversity it's not it is not diversity that we are celebrating it is perversity you think that it's something to be proud of it's not so when you say something like oh Candace Owens we don't want you in our culture you don't understand Black Culture I have to keep reminding you that I don't want to be a part of this culture I want to destroy it I want to destroy it further than it's already destroyed itself I want to go backward your idea of progressivism is clearly regressive our children cannot read this is a new Plantation all of the same problems right when slavery was in existence there were a lot of things that needed to be maintained to make sure that the slaves never woke up the first being the breakdown of the black family slaves were constantly being sold Booker T Washington in his book Up From Slavery talks about the fact that when his mother was sold and his mother was taken away from him he didn't even cry because so often where Salinas moved around that the understanding of family values that core of the family he meant nothing to them they felt nothing they also made sure that slaves were not allowed to learn how to read right it was so necessary to maintain slavery to make sure that their minds were never educated because when there's nothing going on you can insert information into the Bots you can insert information into the robot hello Black America it is happening again why do you think they don't pay attention to the 80 percent of black boys in the fourth grade that cannot meet reading standards in the states of California why don't they want to talk about that because it's perfect it's empty air to insert information into it is why they want those black boys and those black children to look up to cardi B so they can further insert information that will guarantee they are incarcerated celebrating the street lifestyle when you attempt to dignify the undignified this is what happens this is the result but no I guess the the real issue the only topic of today is how dare Kanye West how dare Candace Owens and in response to that I think the only thing I can say is how dare you how dare you continue to insist on our stupidity how dare you continue to reject all of the real problems and make a mockery of those of us who have the courage to stand up and continue to point them out and how dare you think that I'm going to shut up now and that's all I have to say about that [Music]", "BWlU8sNTgVA": "and then there's another piece of this discussion that we're not talking about that's honest you know a few weeks ago i tweeted because i remember when as i was waking up and realizing that i was a conservative i've always felt very uncomfortable jumping in as a pro-life advocate because i knew i've always known there was something wrong with the pro-choice debate but i didn't feel like i had enough research and when i did do research and i determined that i am in fact pro-life and i do not believe that you can be a conservative and not be pro-life i think it is the the basis of conservative ideology but i realized that the reason why i was previously pro-choice wasn't because i was a baby murderer it wasn't because i wanted babies to die it wasn't because i would ever be the person the radicals that are sitting outside of supreme court justice's homes and saying we demand you vote this way or another way the reason was simple was because i was raised in a school system that taught me that it was a clump of cells it was quite innocent i was i was a victim of propaganda i was a victim of being lied to i was told that there was a scientific basis for abortion that if you do it within this time frame it's not a baby it doesn't matter doesn't get transformed into a baby and what would i know i was a teenage girl of course i'm listening to my teachers who i'm supposed to trust right again you go back to what's happening inside of the home when you remove the parents teachers can teach you absolute nonsense so i was brainwashed like all the other girls around me were brainwashed into believing that this was okay and i wanted to put out into the world and so i tweeted to the girls that i grew up with the girls that i know had abortions that just because you have had an abortion it does not mean that you don't have the right to change your mind don't feel like you have to exist in that purgatory in fact the reality of the situation is is that these radicals these people marching and screaming they get all of the time on television the people that are laughing at a baby they get all the time on the television but the truth is that a lot of these women are struggling because they've done something that they regret like getting abortion and they feel like they're never going to be able to join the pro-life side that there's no red carpet there's no welcoming there's no welcome to them into the pro-life movement because they had an abortion and i tell them that that's not true and actually if you've had an abortion you can be one of the loudest advocates for life a lot of those girls are suffering with the decisions that they have made and so i put that out into the universe and and just wanted to welcome them to the pro-life movement and i got a flutter of emails from women who had had abortions thanking me um for even putting that out into the universe for saying i have had so much regret and i do feel like i'm in this purgatory and i want to skim through two of the emails that i received because they're so powerful so this first email that i'm going to skim through it says hi candace i don't know if you'll ever see this but i saw your tweet saying that you would be willing to open your heart to any women who had an abortion any day of the week and that we don't have to follow the left and that's something that i really needed to see or hear i had an abortion last april when i was eight or nine weeks pregnant i really didn't know what to do i didn't want to get an abortion but i didn't want people to judge me and i didn't know if i was mentally prepared to have a kid i was 19 years old and it was with my boyfriend who i'm still with and i'm able to have similar conversations as this with i think a lot of young people like us get brainwashed to think that an abortion is not a big deal or the whole it's just a clump of cells thing i was trying to do research and i was very indecisive even in the clinic but i chose to do it because i know i'm indecisive and i felt like it was more moral to have it earlier than later in pregnancy about a month or two after i had the worst depression of my life i was already depressed and i've gone through abuse through my life but i've never ever been this bad it felt like nothing was real i was constantly afraid of dying and having existential thoughts i didn't feel normal in my own body and i felt so numb i still struggle with some of these things but i've helped myself a lot and god has helped me a lot i know i wouldn't call myself pro-choice though and maybe i would call myself pro-informed consent i don't believe planned parenthood gets informed consent for women only a few states give mental health counseling before the abortion only a few states give you all the risks after the abortion she goes on to say my friend also had an abortion last year her mom and boyfriend pressured her too and then she had a suicide attempt but no one will talk about these issues it helps but i wish more people would also speak out about these things thank you for all that you do this is actually in my opinion the average woman that we are dealing with when we talk about the pro-choice and the pro-life debate we are dealing with women who were lied to their entire lives by a school system and people that are pressured to get abortions talking about a woman's right to choose most of these women are pressured into abortions i've had people in my families i've had people in my family get pregnant and their mothers say you have to get an abortion their boyfriend say you have to get an abortion it's going to ruin my life so this whole concept that's out in the universe of i did it for me me me me me me in reality a lot of these women that are even getting these abortions don't know what they're doing are indecisive and are simply scared because of the brainwashing that is taking place in the school system i want to move on to the second letter because i think the words this is from a mother who's much older now and reflecting on an abortion that she had i i just don't think anybody could spell it out more succinctly and again this is a long letter so i'm going to skim through it dear candace i am a christian mother of three impossibly beautiful children i am blessed to have a husband i adore and who provides for our little family and when i was 17 i killed our first baby i was 17 and pregnant an absolute nightmare to my young mind the thing that strikes me about this moment looking back is that the thought of going through with this pregnancy never even occurred to me i never considered adoption much less actually keeping the baby growing inside of me i just want to pause there because i think that that is so significant and i say this all the time young women in school are not even learning about adoption they're not even learning about successful adoption stories they are being told that abortion is the way that you deal with birth it's a form of birth control nowadays and the best thing for you to do is to simply terminate the pregnancy it is not a part of the education system to show them how many families are struggling with fertility how many families would love to be able to adopt a child and how successful those dynamics work i have a friend who adopted a young child we don't hear this we don't talk about this at all in school she goes on and she says at 17 i called up my local planned parenthood and scheduled an abortion i drove myself to clinic for one thousand dollars the doctors and nurses at planned parenthood helped a 17 year old girl murder her 12 week old baby i am not sure i will ever be able to forgive myself for this but when i saw your post on instagram imploring women who had had abortions and now regret them not to stay silent i knew i had to share my story with someone women like me as you said need to speak up but i often felt caught between a rock and a hard place women like me are pariahs in a sense conservatives want nothing to do with us and perhaps rightly so because we murdered our unborn babies and the left cannot afford to allow our voices to be heard because we do not support their narrative that an abortion is good for women but who else can truly speak to the devastating guilt that i will love that i will live with for the rest of my life or the incredible sadness i feel as i look into the eyes of the three children i would do anything for and wonder about that first baby what would he or she have been like are they in heaven now looking down at the family that they should have had do they know how sorry i am and how badly i wish i could pray them back to earth despite what the medium a left would have women believe abortion is never the answer rather it is a sentence to a lifetime of guilt and self-hatred that cannot be undone i mean no words absolutely no words i think that last line that it is a lifetime sentence to guilt that can never be undone this is the average women that we are dealing with and i implore conservatives to stop feeling like we have to grow more radical in order to combat the radicalism that you see on the left that is a fringe minority that you were seeing on those screens a very fringe minority the average woman knows that she was taught something wrong the average woman that is pro-choice feels like they have no choice but to be that way because of a decision that they made that wasn't really their own fault brainwash is real propaganda is real we see that everywhere around us we need to welcome these women and i just want to publicly thank them for sharing those stories thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get

candace when is the blm dock dropping you told me it was going to be here and now it's pushed back i know we had to include the financials of black lives matter once they dropped it we knew it was too good not to report on but today as a nice teaser for you guys i have two very special guests that are from the documentary the greatest lie ever told george floyd and the rise of blm liz colin has worked for 20 years as a multi-emmy award-winning journalist she left the mainstream media this year to work for an independent news organization in minnesota that's called alpha news bob crowell her husband served 32 years in the minneapolis police department 25 of them elected to the union board retired as lieutenant and president of the union in addition he served 21 years in the army reserve please welcome liz cotlin and bob kroll all right guys so you guys were a piece of the documentary because first and foremost there was just a lot of human interest stories that we wanted to explore people kind of forgot um after the fires dispersed that there were a lot of individuals who had their lives destroyed because the black lives matter narrative people were thirsty for blood and when we landed upon your story i was just just completely moved by what you guys suffered through for no reason other than you're a police officer and hey you happen to be his wife and so you've got to go so bob let's just start with you what went down george floyd passes and the media creates a circus around that narrative and they're out for blood what were you doing and what happened to you at the time i was serving as union president and that's elected by all the members except for the top 20 appointed people after the riots were so mishandled by leadership within from the governor on down the governor the mayor of minneapolis and their appointed people the chief they failed to control the riots miserably there was you know half a billion dollars in damage done to the city 1500 businesses destroyed lake street and other prime areas of the city absolutely destroyed including many black business owners had their businesses lost in in their lack of controlling that they needed a scapegoat and what they did was they formulated a plan that problem officers and they named chauvin that it was the union's fault that he was still employed and the union was resistant to reform all of it completely false right so they needed a scapegoat correct and they decided you you were the perfect scapegoat to do this yes um okay so at least at least you have something to do with the police union right your wife you're a journalist at the time right liz you're a journalist you're working you have done incredible work with them how long have you been with the organization that you were with at the time um of george floyd it was 12 years i'd been there for 12 years i'm a minnesota native it was the station i grew up watching my dream job to work there and i was in an anchor role and a high profile reporting role too and that changed overnight well why would it change this makes no sense something happens to george floyd yes you happen to be married to this guy but what did it have to do with you it kind of went along with the the scapegoat situation so everybody was looking looking to to blame uh to blame someone and the media i felt at the time helped to perpetuate this narrow narrative perpetuate this lie i feel like we're learning we're learning now this isn't a matter of right or wrong this is about the truth and i felt like we were not we were not asking the right questions there was no critical thinking i felt like in the in the days and even the moments moments after and i so i was immediately silenced i i held on for a couple years um at that station but instead of asking asking what i felt were good questions to ask after an incident like this we instead are pushing the narrative um at the station where i worked that 50 of the people we now interview um have to be non-white or of a protected class we're going through equity training this is what we're spending our time on as as a newsroom in minnesota when i think there were actual real issues to be explored okay guys it's time to take a minute and talk about one of our great sponsors expressvpn every time you connect to an unencrypted network like a cafe airport or hotel wi-fi your online

little bit of everything politics uh police issues uh all of that went away after well she anchored and she was removed from an anchor also right yeah i was a regular anchor at the station you know people who are kind of the faces of the station if you will but the last newscast i anchored was may 24th of 2020. so they pulled you off of anchoring altogether correct and what was the reason that the executives gave you i think in the beginning uh everybody kind of lost their mind we had death threats uh to our home uh people protested at our home at the television station as well so i think it was a safety issue in the first you know no weeks i understood that but as this was going i could tell that i there is no there's no road back for me i was quickly replaced we were congratulating the person that took my job after i held it for 12 years um but there was no real direct communication of if i could ever get this position back and this was simply because you were married to 100 yeah okay so i want to just pause here and uh offer a clip from a documentary so we can just see a little bit more of your guy's story let's take a look they came to the station where i worked and held a protest during the six o'clock news demanding that i be fired or being married to a police officer i i'm i'm seeing this story from so many different lenses uh as as a wife as a journalist but as a mom i think it's where it it's where it hit me the hardest in the early days i'm calling friends hey can you take anthony we have another death threat or my parents are watching him for a few days he doesn't know what's going on i mean you can't even explain this stuff to adults nonetheless a a seven-year-old child and he happened to see a little clip of the news in the in the early days and said wait a minute so the police made a mistake and they're stealing stuff from target in his little mind he knew that this did not make sense this isn't okay okay so bob what happened i guess once they declared you're gonna be the fall guy right you somehow had something to do with derek shobin i guess what was the tie how are they able to tie you to chauvin at all this is interesting because they go back to shelvin having 18 complaints and he's a problem officer and has never been dealt with because the union protected him the reality is this is false also he had 16 complaints that were investigated and he was cleared of any wrongdoing and he had two where he received coaching which is non-disciplinary so the truth is the federation never even had a role in protecting his job at all through his entire history um but they blamed it that any type of reform issues they tried to do we stood in the way of as we as the union which is not true either we worked with them to to develop the body camera roll out we we had a police community relations council we were an active part of we always went along with any reform proposals they had and they created a false narrative that we were resistant and that they were hamstrung by the labor agreement but the reality is i worked on seven different labor agreements over my 25 years on the board with the city they were signed off by all the elected officials each time and since i've retired they signed off another labor agreement and it dealt nothing with the discipline arena at all which was the narrative they had so no changes after baba's bob and the union are are the the fall people for all of this yeah nothing's changed actually just this morning they released some changes to the discipline matrix that they don't even need the union to be part of they publicized it this morning on television locally that they made changes to the disciplined matrix in the minneapolis pd which they've had full authority to do all along wow and and so obviously the minneapolis community as i visited has been suffering tremendously since all of this i can't imagine why any person would have the proclivity to want to be a police officer but i want to turn to focus about to turn the focus to what you guys actually went through at home because of this um just walk us through it it was uh a few months well we had a few different protests at our house um one was a black lives matter uh protest in in august so it was a few months after the incident but there were more than 100 people there including a man running to be a state rep at the time endorsed by the democratic party of minnesota threatening to burn the neighborhood down on on a bull horn shouting obscenities of children in our in our neighborhood um we were we were not home but even an incident like that was was a protest that the station where i worked refused to cover for several days it wasn't they had replica pinatas of us um that they beat with a stick representative thompson who lives referred to be beat apart the pinatas of us in our driveway cheered on uh he was yelling uh profanities in a bullahorn scaring children in the neighborhood um scaryly scaringly enough he was uh overwhelmingly won the election after wow and from the east side and the dfl did not pull their indoors the governor endorsed after that incident they didn't pull it so he was beating a pinata in effigy of you each of us of each of you there were two pinatas yes and there was no disciplinary action taken the media didn't get behind this and say this is abhorrent and he won he won he won the election wow and it's such it's just so interesting because apparently we've at least been told that black lives matters it wants to decrease violence and decrease brutality and yet on this one hand they seem to have just been granted a clean slate to do whatever they wanted to you simply because you were the fall guy and somehow you were responsible for derek chovin and they published our address online and we were as his head received several death threats one person was actually convicted of a bomb threat a pretty detailed threat that they they mailed us but but our son used to get the mail he could no longer do that it was just all of these things that and we live in a you know little cul-de-sac in minnesota everybody kind of knows everyone in the neighborhood but we really had to rethink the way we lived thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get

next generation again i love this video obviously i've been covering extensively how hyper-sexualized the culture has become this is just not the same america that i grew up in and obviously as someone who grew up used public transportation buses subways seeing this stuff as an ad like people their tongues touching and saying pansexual for an ad for okcupid how do you guys feel about it well i think that you know i want people to understand that this is not an accident it's not like somebody accidentally drew that up you know people spend billions of dollars in marketing so it's a strategic marketing strategy and it is effectively hurting our youth you know grown-up adults who are participating in this they may understand how to deal with the images that they see but young kids are not able to process this properly however i do believe that it's targeted to get young people's minds um you know conditioned so when they do get older they're more susceptible to buying into what this advertisement is showing right what do you think paul i just can't really understand why people can't let others live and let live uh in my bible it says that god should judge people and we should not i believe it says something like judge not lest you be judged unless god came down and gay ordained people with the power to judge all gay people then we should still be staying true i wasn't gay i don't care if it's two straight people and their tongues are interlocking on the subway i would have a problem with it let's not make this a gay thing it's not about being gay it's like you know this i'm talking about sexualization right so two tongues touching let's pretend it was a man and a female and they were both straight i saw a problem with it you're saying you think it's fine well it's it's people kissing as you know that the more we progress in society thing the the restraints get looser right the further we move away from god the more it opens up the world to do whatever it pleases right so i can't necessarily say that this is wrong i can't say this is wrong people kiss on tv every day people kiss everywhere all the time but now it's wrong why do you have a problem with it because i think it's disgusting for children to see two tons of adults touching in a subway and i am raising a child and i would never want to walk somewhere and again don't care if you're black white straight trans uh pansexual even though half of these terms even mean anymore i don't want to see it okay and that's not kissing two tongues that is not kissing right that's not that is something else that's happening there right it's disgusting it's meant to be provocative and it's unnecessary that an advertiser sat down and thought this was the only way to convey a message when you're talking about okcupid which is supposed to be a dating app like why doesn't even need to be sexual at all this is not what the ads looked like when we were growing up i think it's hypocritical because you got the whole world on tinder you got the whole world hooking up with people but now it's not now you don't want to see it in your face but we've been seeing it in movies we've been seeing it on television now all of a sudden people have a problem with it okay we're going to say this is problematic then we need to take a step back and look throughout the decades and say okay this is the process this is how we arrived at this point we can't just act like this is something new to us i agree let me i do that's exactly what i'm doing i'm taking issue with the way society has gone down the drain let me interject real quick um let's go back to the bible you know about judging you know the bible is very clear you should know them by their fruit yes so the things that are in the bible doesn't say that you shouldn't judge people you can't condemn a person but you can make an evaluation about what you think is appropriate according to what god's word is and so when you go i think we i think we're on the same page we're saying that these things are not appropriate it's fair to say that as a christian man as a believer these are not appropriate neither are the movies that they're presenting kissing in that are eligible for young people i'm not talking about radio movies i'm not talking about pg-13 movies you know i'm talking about ones that are that are involving children that are uh rated for younger audiences when you have kissing and sexuality i think it's inappropriate so just because they put it out there just because it's mainstream doesn't mean that it's not inappropriate are we back are we back at a place where we are arguing again sex ed in school yeah i think sex like like like are are we back at that point yeah that's what i'm trying because well if you want to go back to that if we didn't introduce it then aids would have claimed more lives than it did if we didn't take a step back that you like to spend people i'm unspendable i'm 300 pounds you ain't gonna spit in this one all right if you look back we had to educate people as to what sex was so that we could stop the spread of those sexually transmitted diseases incorrect how so factually incorrect i am going to educate you i don't need to spin you but i am going to educate please do okay so there's a book by thomas soul and he unpacks very carefully how sex education actually what's led to is more kids having sex another it was predicated on a lie the entire sex education push was predicated on this belief that high school people high school students were doing it anyways they were already having sex and that was wrong actually before they started the sex ed initiative in the 1970s the average kid that was graduating high school was graduating with their virginity after they started the sex ed initiative within within one decade that radically transformed and now the majority of kids are doing it actually sex education was teaching them about what sex was and that conversation should have been reserved for their parents and the birds and the bees discussion so sex ed has perverted children not the other way around and i think i just i just want to respond and i just want to keep them clapping because if we go back decades ago people were having children in their teens people were being married in their team so now you're telling me now you're telling me it's it's all false no we can look up that one site but i'm talking about other individuals and other people who have proved that we needed sex ed in our schools to wake our children up to the fact that their disease is sponsored by planned parenthood killed them it was sponsored we can argue a lot of things but the truth is the truth no you told me what you read in a book who about a person who you admire or your youtube channel no not about personal ideas it's someone who you choose to adopt their philosophies the problem with this country the problem the problem with this country is we take the words of people on tv we take the words of politicians instead of doing research for ourselves we live in a society where people perpetuate lies and it continues to create this divide in our country instead of looking at the truth what is our aversion to the truth the truth offends people now people don't want to hear the truth why because there's so many people out here spinning the truth well i just told you the truth so i just want to tell you that tell me your truth no i didn't tell you the truth soul is not a politician he's actually a researcher getting back to research so so thomas soul is jesus and the rest of these people are simple followers who know nothing about kids became more sexualized more kids i worked on this as a kid i was a peer sex educator as a kid i worked on this let's get to this um let's get to something that we agree with let's let's just throw that in there because that is um a good way to move on yeah yeah but let's get something that we agree with so if you had a video that um went viral and i have been kind of beating the drum about these vaccine mandates and how a unconstitutional they are but also just so reminiscent of atrocities that have happened in the past um and you had a video that went viral so let's watch that clip of you in new york well it's a choice okay it's a choice you shouldn't exclude people from everyday activities because they choose not to engage in something the government story on the vaccines have changed every one to two months since donald trump the the vaccines have had effects that that people come out and say oh well you know that never happens but they do happen people die joe biden said folks wouldn't be hospitalized people are being hospitalized and dying yet again i'm not telling you not to get it i'm just saying you should have a choice that is well said i'll ask you a personal question are you vaccinated hell no okay i'm not i'm sorry me neither me neither yeah so can you just explain to us kind of give us an inside track of what's going on in new york city right now and what is the response that you're getting to this which to me should be common sense that people should have a choice as to whether or not they want to inject chemicals into their body but under this administration it's apparently not i mean now that i have your audience's ear right oh i didn't just wake up one day and become right on one topic right as a leader in this movement as a man who has a business degree in a law degree someone who has fought for our people who have served our people someone who's followed christ right this movement this this movement for the liberation of black people we're right on a lot of topics and what i ask conservatives and people who don't usually listen to us to do is actually open your mind and listen to the things we're saying get past what's in front of you and and and just try to understand where we're coming from so now we're here at these um at these vaccines you are fully aware of the fact that black people have been experimented on in medicine since slavery this is nothing that we can argue uh yeah yeah you can argue about the truth it's the truth right you say it again just say experiment 100 come on what else yeah whatever give it to them what else well under slavery they technically slaves were property so beyond slavery is what i think is almost the most interesting element because we're talking about an experiment in the 1970s that's very recent the same cdc they never were disbanded the same you know human health services and everywhere expanded in fact they've been promoted and they have more money and power than ever and uh we've never been in america where they said you're going to be forced to either not be able to move in society or inject yourself with something that has been approved for you know i guess now it's just patently approved um but it's problematic me personally because of all the men all the reasons you mentioned and i've mentioned i'm not taking a shot someone asked me what's my burden to prove to make me take it i don't know i'll know it when i get there um but these these this vaccine and this passport has shifted the narrative in a lot of ways because right now they've made these vaccine passports freedom papers right to where police to where business owners to where people who do not like black people can use these vaccine passports as a way to harass and oppress black people so you look at carmines and um y'all will love this right farm for carmine's in my opinion was the biggest fake news story of 2021 why you had these three women who were seen on tv pummeling this little asian woman right and what the story that carmine's ran with and new york city politicians ran with was they were asked for this vaccine and they reacted violently but what they didn't explain was that this woman taunted them from the time they arrived i could lead you through a long sequence of events but there was this condescending tone in her voice there was racism there was a racial slur mentioned to these people okay now i can't even dispute any of that and i i have not followed that story closely enough but i do want to know but obviously because of the story situation happened in carmine's black lives matter is now you know actively saying they want to end to vaccine mandates what has been the response and this interesting because in new york all the politicians were very pro-black lives matter during the election cycle okay we haven't seen any of these you know that same amount of support since binding got into office i have said to you that i think black lives matter is very much used to elect politicians and then once the politicians are in office nobody cares anymore here's the thing candace we talked about this years ago and what did i do i agree with you you want to know when black lives matter will have another rise again it'll be the next presidential election i don't know the next time or the next yeah it'll be the next election cycle so with that being said i just want to walk you through how we got to this place and i'll make it quick these four three women were walking back into the restaurant they were they were going in they were escorted by a manager and this woman stepped into the hallway and said something there's no audio but all four women turned and looked like what did she say and they went outside and they handled her right now a lot of people might say hey hawk this audience is like hulk what are you talking about they handled her they put hands on her but i was over by a bunch of honky tonk bars right and i know those people over there get drunk and brawl a lot okay like people people fight over disrespect so if you come and say something to me that has been a racial trigger to my people for hundreds of years and i put my hands on you there is no one who can judge you for being violent in that situation what they did what they did was this woman antagonized them but the politically savvy thing to say was it was the vaccine okay that's how they covered up right now so let me let me let me yeah i'm gonna let i just want to jump in here i you know i agree with you that people shouldn't blindly take the vaccine if that's what you want to do do your research yeah it should be a choice people shouldn't be made to do that however i disagree with this being racial household i i don't believe that it's racial you know just because there's disparities doesn't mean that there's discrimination tommy so wrote a book about that disparities in spinning y'all love this man he's great and you just look like a cult do you know who talked about it no i have okay so after you get off the show go look at thomas so they have a documentary you can look it online he's the smartest most brilliant man black man to ever exist okay smartest guy you're a smartest black man smarter than jesus to ever exist better than jesus to ever exist that was a smart black man yeah jesus wasn't just a man so he can't count like that so he was black though right so yeah but what i'm saying is that well you could say he had darker skin i mean we can go down that argument but anyway but let's stay focused we're gonna stay focused we'll stay focused on this so i don't think it has much to do with race but i think it's a correlation here right um you see that these vaccines disproportionately affect black people yeah the same way with uh certain other things in our society that disproportionately affect black people like the welfare state and other things that democrats do disproportionately affect black people and so i see republicans have had their hand in racist policies you could talk about a hand but i'm talking about the overall scheme here you cannot deny that democrats have been overwhelmingly responsible for the degradation of the black community even now who's pushing the vaccine no now here's here's the thing you asked me a question let me just let me just ask you this question all right then you do this who's pushing a vaccine right now which political party i can talk now yes sir okay here's the you're starting to like me i appreciate that here's the problem i just want to say i have like four of the topics i want to get to we we go we go you know we always run over i know but i got an hour over real quick okay real quick the democrats and the republicans have oppressed backed people america is a racist place yes yes every statistic indicates that it is give you an example an example of systemic racism let's talk about policing let's let's talk about policing i would love to talk about are you saying police but let's talk about education first because because everybody's like oh he's black lasagna he's going to talk about policing let's talk about you don't agree but you don't agree with that let me talk get the tension out of your chest man hold back of the republican negro brigade right so so here we go uh systemic racing racism redlining right candace always talks about black economics the reason why black people are so far behind in the wealth gap is because programs were set in place to deny us loans to deny us home ownership to deny us access to an education and this has been a trickle-down effect this is still proven what program denied us access to education there was uh education in and of itself we couldn't we were not allowed into schools yeah but you said a program this is i'm sorry systemic racism systemic racism so programs like what was it the 1934 housing rights act i believe it was denied us access to banking right we couldn't get mortgages we couldn't get insurance so here you had here you had here you had black people who couldn't hand down a house to their children black people who couldn't get insurance policies so when they had died their families couldn't bury them properly them fam their families couldn't have wealth this is a system this came under under roosevelt and this is a very real thing like like i'm not a democrat i'm not a republican i'm a purveyor of truth to the americans really interesting everybody everybody can find that no because the thing is about education is redlining and that's it's great i mean i mean but i just whenever you if you see why i haven't finished my statement if you ever have you're all the way back to that he jumps in because because you got all the way back to the 19th point black people no i don't have to be quick actually actually if you want to teach me how to shoot talk about shooting copy if you want to talk to me about making a point then you need to look in my law school education okay but we'll uh black people are in schools that are failing across the country and nobody has fixed that i know you want to say it's democratic cities but republican cities are failing black the black people thank you i'm so glad you said that responsibility for the black community you said something about blm i have moved in a different direction than the black lives matter movement and created something called black opportunities because i know that in order for black people to attain independence attain independence for black people to attain independence they have to build themselves up financially we'll get back to the show in a moment but first i need to talk to you about where you're buying your meat as we all know misinformation is everywhere in our culture

goodranchers.com candace and use code candace at checkout mention the things that the government has done i'm saying what are the things that black people have to be responsible for personal responsibility when it comes to education when it comes to showing up at the school board when it comes to teaching your children at home when it comes to being married and having children in a stable home all of those things are personal responsibilities that the black community have to have to have responsible or be responsible for as well i mean you're talking about government entities that's not everything when you talk about people not getting access to loans that's not every black person we talk about education system being flawed in the black community that's not every black person wait wait wait wait wait see this is why i have to talk over people you said something that that warranted a response you said something that warranted one to brandon i'm just gonna say brandon did you know that another thomas soul book that it actually uh tells you that black people are more likely to be declined from a bank that's a black owned bank rather than a white owned bank but you also know that american i mean that asians are declining i mean are accepted at a higher rate than white people in this country i learned that in thomas i just wanted to add those little okay here's what it is this is american politics right people with their views want to shout at people instead of allowing them to make their points this is this is this is the problem sounds good this is this is this is this is the absolute problem you said i had to go walk all the way back he's going to be so you had to go all the way back to the 1930s but i made a point about failing schools across the country right now he said something about black accountability and i as i said here and described the the a program that is unlike any other country any other in the country black opportunities that is like any other in the country that is unlike any other civil rights organization in in america when i'm trying to lay that down to you when i'm trying to tell you how i can start teaching kids about tech how i can start getting people vocational skills from early on giving kids an education outside of what they're what they're dealing with in these garbage schools when i start talking about that i get cut off you constantly think that you're in this victim mentality i'm going to get the mentality i'm trying to have a great trump supporters have been crying since he lost the uh election you're such a hypocrite people have been running around oh the election was rigged oh there's something wrong here i'm like oh my god isn't this what they accused us of doing well didn't the democrats do that when 2016. they had a whole russia collusion uh investigation for three years yeah yeah but guess what i'm not a fan of the democratic party me neither i am a follower of i am a follower of malcolm x who said that the republicans were wolves and the democrats are wolves in sheep's clothing what does black lives matter what is black lives matter now now now you have to really you have to really understand there's a hierarchy to black lives matter there is black lives matter global that's whatever they're doing over there then they're the people who go outside who watch someone like george floyd being murdered on television who watch people like eric garner being choked to death you have people like that who just go out who it hurts who it hurts and just want to go outside and say stop the racism and then you have independent organizations like ours like black lives matter greater new york who operates in a very effective way nobody will tell you we fed 15 000 people last year in the height of covet nobody will tell you that we raised that money without the help of new york city government nobody will tell you that i open the only montessori school in the bronx new york school systems are failing we created a school that caters to the needs of our children those are the things that don't make the news because they're not click baits like candice we get crazy it's cool but when we talk we talk when we talk we talk right i'm the bottom line i just really want to get to my other four topics are you going to people i'm going to switch the topic to the uh border patrol and let's uh watch obviously the media um said that haitians were being whipped and you can actually see the photo which we're going to pull up here uh haitians being whipped on the border this went viral and this inspired a uh a very big reaction from our politicians we can actually cut to seeing some of uh kamala and maxine waters responding to this picture i was outraged by it i it was horrible and and deeply troubling there's been now an investigation that is being conducted which i fully support and there needs to be consequence and accountability uh the human beings should not be treated that way and as we all know it also evoked images of some of the worst moments of our history where that kind of behavior has been used against the indigenous people of our country has been used against african americans during times of slavery and we can uh also maxine has always got something to say what the hell are we doing here what we witness takes us back hundreds of years what we witnessed was worse than what we witnessed in slavery cowboys with their reigns again whipping black people haitians into the water where they're scrambling and falling down when all they're trying to do is escape from violence in their country so let me tell you like i love this so much because it provided the perfect cover there was so much pressure mounting on democrats to answer for why uh you know our country is currently being invaded right uh at the border and they see this photo and they go absolutely crazy and it was a great story the only problem with it was that didn't happen right so what were your thoughts when when you saw this what's your opinion on this story well first of all i heard it come out in the news that they were whipping whipping people and i said that seemed way too juicy you know and my whole thing if it's too juicy let me do some research so all i did was do a little research looked at the pictures i looked at a cowboy online and they were talking about how to use split range the dynamics of split range how the horse you know is maneuvered with the reins and it's clear that they weren't whipping people it's clear that that's not a tactic taught by the border patrol agents all of that is very clear all you got to do is do a little bit of research and to see politicians come out and act like this was worse than slavery to act like these people are being whipped this is the most horrid scene that they've ever seen in their lives and they are just projecting a lie and as you notice they're all saying the same thing right they all are coming back to our history of racism in the black community when these are haitian people who are invading a country right and they're not getting whipped it's clear yeah and so obviously now what happened of course was the photographer who is not even on the conservative side of the political spectrum came out and said they were just not being whipped and it's just a weird angle captured the migrant photos as agents didn't use whips and now we actually um have the full video of so you can actually see what happened and how the media is still trying to lie about it okay okay hawk your thoughts i'm afraid i can't give people the response that um they were warned i see i see haitians i see people have whose country has been ravaged by atrocity after atrocity earthquakes hurricanes the clintons like these these people are hopeless and they are trying to make it to the land of opportunity i'm not having a whole debate but as a christian i feel compassion for those people the imagery when it first hit looked terrible right now even looking at this it does evoke like i would love for you all to look up a study by the american psychology association about racial trauma right because it's really a thing and it has a similar effect as ptsd any soldiers out there you might know what i'm talking about but pete with that ptsd looking at this it makes me think about slavery now they came out with the the and i'm gonna finish quick with respect um the story about the whips i was like wow this is effing horrible right but i see people in a really destitute 15 000 people who are starving who are just seeking a better opportunity and i see them being exploited by the media by this administration listen when the mexicans were at the border and trump was in office all of these same democrats aoc pelosi schumer they all ran to the border right trump is the worst person in the world but i was stan the one standing up in the dark the lone voice saying obama's immigration policies were atrocious trump's doing the same thing now biden's doing it all again all over again and flip-flopping camilla two months ago said i can't do anything about immigration it's out of my hands it's too much to handle the the fact of the matter is democrats nor republicans have figured out immigration period i would say i would say yeah well we didn't have this going on when trump was president though obviously the numbers that are coming in right now are like nothing we've ever seen before um and i think a wall would work but also maybe not because they're taking flights yeah why do you think they're coming now what those haitians weren't there were thousands coming to the border when trump was president like people come to america we did not have a certain come to america most of the people here we realized we did not have a surge of hate showing up at our murder when trump was president so i'm just asking a question why do you think they're coming now you know what the world is in a destitute place we were ravaged by kovitt whether you believe in covet or not econ the economy was shut down there's been a lot of problems like america has a problem with black migrants with migrants of color when it was when they were rounding people up i didn't see one russian person in handcuffs like when we had the raids in new york when i used to have to go to make sure that ice wasn't beating the crap out of people it wasn't in white neighborhoods so you mean to tell me why sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry america has a problem with black immigrants are you inc or brown immigrants what are you saying i want to get this straight from you well i don't know are you including mexicans yes do you know what they account for over 50 of all of our immigrants so we have a problem with over 50 of all of our immigrants but what about the asian immigrants well they can't run over the border so they actually come in legally so they're pretty far wait wait wait we we've been here before yeah we've been here before how many there are two borders people sneak into this country of all walks of life stop making just how many how many illegal asian immigrants do you think we have in america give people the truth i'm telling you the truth everybody comes into the country and democrats and republicans alike make these these these exploitative uh uh mockeries of immigration by just pointing to the ones who are of color who are politically poignant listen can immigrants come here no no this is just not true hulk i can't just let you say something just makes no sense african immigrants come here legally asian immigrants come here legally uh they're separated by ocean so yes that's the reason why i'm here illegally as well but not not in the issue that we have right now not in a search yes there are some yes there are some illegal african immigrants there aren't two hundred thousand at the border trying to come in okay that just is not what's happening be realistic the illegal immigration problem is almost exclusively a problem that's happening at the south of the border you paint with these wide brushes and you deny people the truth to everybody who's watching stop listening to people on tv and read an effing book okay let's talk about black authors who i read like i'm a huge fan of james baldwin like just because i don't read what you thank you you can clap you can clap it's all right it's a right to be an alone person in the majority it's really okay it's real especially when people are trying to suppress your thoughts nobody is suppressing your thoughts i'm suppressing what is actually incorrect and i'm correcting it and you're getting upset when i correct it with an actual book you say that book is not good enough and then when i correct it with an actual fact you say go read a book this is very simple we have immigration laws it's very simple if you want to come come to a port of entry nobody gets rejected at a port of entry you go through a proceeding now if you go under the fence you go over the fence you start getting caught out on a rio grande yeah you're going to get detained it's very simple it's very simple we can work on some of our immigration laws but we do allow more immigrants in our country than any other country in the world millions a year legally yeah and the overwhelming majority are immigrants of color so i'm slapping down your lie that we're somehow oh here's let's let's bring this immigrants that were accepted no but you stopped talking when she talked that's what i'm saying you've been talking for like you got a whole show going ahead let me i'm just gonna say this it's like a breath of fresh air to some when we talk when we talk about racism and you talk about the bias against people of color i mean the border patrol agents are 60 hispanic so most of the border patrol are people of color in the first place so i don't believe in the racism that you are portraying when i look at what happens um with hel seeing them running to the border when it was when trump was in office because they were trying to draw attention to make trump look bad now they don't want to go to the border because they don't want you to know what's happening you're talking about 15 000 people not only have they came over here illegally not only have they breached and pretty much invaded our country they do not have satisfactory conditions that they're living in we cannot offer them proper food we cannot offer them proper housing we cannot offer them safety and the reason why they're going to do that forever the reason why they're coming here is because our administration is pretty much telling them it's an open border you come here you get in you have amnesty this is that is the reason why they are coming here and putting their lives on the line i'm with you right i'm with you like listen listen to what i'm saying listen to whatever i think that was like 40 seconds right there i did that okay i'm gonna do it real quick i'm gonna do it real quick no he's not as a christian no he's not probably won't right as a christian like a black person as a christian if people are fleeing political persecution they're fleeing a a country ravaged and devastated i have a heart i care about people now if you want to talk about this country the the the the um the democrats saying hey it's an open border it's a lie bro okay listen to what i'm saying so what i'm saying this is why i can't finish in 47 no i don't understand listen you're saying they're encouraging them seeing them that it's open what i'm saying is a lot of the problem is the problem is what they what politicians say to you and what they actually do is not a new concept this american is apple pie so they're saying yes when trump is in office come come come now they're in power they're like stop i can't do anything for you like i'm not here to argue politics i just love people yeah i also want to say that to that point earlier that you said about ptsd what did you say post black syndrome or something which is in people in the racial trauma racial trauma and you said when you saw these whips for you know same with slavery what you said is akin to ptsd of people that were in the military and you said it's a similar thing that you experienced when you when you at first thought that people were being whipped the haitians were being whipped imagery has an effect imagery has an effect i do want to also say just like out of respect to the military man that have ptsd they actually served in the war you were not actually a slave i find that to be a bit effective wait last week wait wait wait wait no no no no no i want to say you absolutely will not say that and i will not allow that election you're going to slave you don't have ptsd from slavery and who has mental issues you bash people with mental illness that's what you do and you just do that you bash people who have mental illness so of course you would well yes you know what i think it is if you think that you're suffering from ptsd from slavery you've never been a slave i'm not bashing you just calling it out after that ptsd do not correlate it to the military men who are suffering from something they actually expect you have a platform where you can tell people the truth but you make a lot of money but spewing these lies but you got

okay so much I want to talk to you about but I want to make sure that everyone is watching the show knows your story because I mean this sport has really come up MMA has really come up in a big way I definitely called it a few years ago because all of the other sports just went so woke and the whole concept of going to a game a basketball game football is like you get to tune out the noise and enjoy something you know uh with your son or you know whoever and now it just seems like everywhere you go you're being lectured and the UFC sort of stayed out of it we've had Dana White on the show and now it's blowing up and there are so many celebrities ringside and you have been a fighter for how long my whole life since I was five years old I got into wrestling karate and you know I decided that I wanted to follow this MMA dream when I was in high school because it was the best way to create a better life for me and my family there wasn't a lot of money in wrestling and going to Olympics it was you know trying to get in the UFC and make a better life for yourself so so you're fighting and you kind of almost turned your dream into a nightmare it was about to be over for you I want to talk about how you just became a household name and exploded onto the scene so it was about to be over for you why and then what happened after that that just sort of totally changed the game yeah so we talked about this before about you know how my career was pretty much made in Brazil they were talking about cutting me I was I had one loss in the UFC I was like 12-1 uh they said they didn't like my style they said I was boring it was the last fight in my contract they said hey we're going to cut you we don't like your style you don't bring anything to the table entertainment aspect wise so we got to let you go and I was fighting the number two guy in the world at the time in Brazil in his hometown this guy Damien Maya and then I go on and I beat him you know I left him in a pool of his own blood in his home City and then you know I I called the Brazilians you know I called the city a dump and I said Brazil is a dump and all you people are filthy animals I think you know I think we might have a clip of that let's watch it why did you ask for this fight and did it go as you expected it to I said Tyron Woodley I'm coming for you if you don't answer the front door I'm Gonna Knock in and I'm gonna take what's fun [Applause] [Laughter] so this is kind of one of my favorite elements of the UFC it's just the trash talking that goes on back and forth and Dan just lets it Fly he's like you

in a tricky situation you're in a different country and how did they respond to this they didn't respond well they got a lot of death threats I had to get like the Brazilian Secret Service like I was

"CNIVX6FduLk": "happy Friday everyone yes it's Friday you have made it through a long week there we go question that I want to leave you with going into the weekend is why is everybody so sensitive you know what I mean just seems like there's a lot more feelings these days plus I'll be giving my thoughts on gay Tucker Carlson appearance last night and I'll be sharing the most insulting video I think that I have ever seen in my life all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] so why is everybody so sensitive you know I'm talking about you you just look around and there are a lot of feelings just everybody has a feeling and they want to share that feeling publicly and I'm looking at these kids going wow you are incredibly sensitive so unlike the generations before us I always go back to my grandfather you know my favorite human being ever and I think about all that he lived through my grandfather growing up during the times of segregation real actual social issues that existed in this country right growing up as a child and having to work forced to work on a sharecropping farm so that his family could eat right and yet I never remember my grandfather having all of these feelings he was never angry about the way that he grew up in fact I never saw my grandfather cry not even on my grandmother's dying day they were married from a time that he was 17 years old 40 some plus years no tears a true strong patriarch today you just can't even imagine us producing that sort of human being everybody is sensitive even more sensitive than they were when I was growing up in fact I was thinking about this I was thinking about my first day of kindergarten you're not even going to believe what happened to me so it was sort of my first time being properly socialized I didn't go to preschool and all of The Kindergartners did go to preschool but my first day meeting a bunch of people that I didn't know outside of my family web I remember we went to the playground it was recess time and I had met a girl in my classroom her name was Susan and she was introducing me to all of her preschool preschool friends out in out on the playground and she introduced me to this girl and her name was Amy I said Amy this is my new Fred Candace and Amy looked at me and she said ugly and she ran she just ran away and I was so mortified and so heartbroken that I was meeting this girl and she said something so mean to me that I sat on the corner of the playground and I cried I know can you imagine how sad do you feel for me little kindergarten Candace I'm gonna have to show you a picture of me in kindergarten I hope I can find one but little me crying outside so sad that this girl had hurt my feelings and I was just trying to make some friends and actually if you fast forward the most interesting part of this is that me and that girl who called me ugly then became best friends and we stayed best friends all the way through to high school so this little incident was something that we'd go back and laugh at I don't know maybe she said it because she wanted to be friends with me and thought I was maybe cool but went the other way and ran I don't know I couldn't tell you and I was thinking about that incident and thinking of how different that would be today right because Amy was white and if that had ever happened it would just be an entirely different category they would say that this little girl didn't know but she was implicitly racist she wasn't just trying out or experimenting being mean she was just implicitly racist and what I suffered through would be something that I would be able to share over and over again as the first time that I experienced racism I don't know maybe under the web of CRT that experience would be categorized I was also talking about other elements of my childhood and just just what it's like to grow up in a black household or at least how it was during that time and parents are tough our parents are a lot tougher I think than most parents for example there's an expression that most black Americans if you tell them do you got McDonald's money they'll know exactly what you are referring to for whatever reason in Black households whenever you're growing up and you'd ask your parents for anything particularly for whatever reason we'd say oh can we go to McDonald's and your mom will look at you and say you got McDonald's money Okay no Okay then we're not going to McDonald's Toys R Us you got Toys R Us money okay then we aren't going to Toys R Us right there's another thing that if you share your feelings which is it makes me laugh but it's true if you say something to your parents when I was growing up like I'm depressed your mom would say to you why don't you go depress them dishes right this is sort of Black Parenting they just would insert your emotion and tell you to go do a random chore so if you were crying about anything it just gets turned into some chore you need to do not addressing your underlying sadness in fact I think one of the greatest things that my mom used to say to me growing up was when I would get really sad like really upset like how could I possibly be made to live in this household I would say to my mother through tears that I was going to run away my mother would always say the same thing back to me she would say Don't run walk save your energy because nobody is coming after you ouch owies the sick burn and then of course I would cry even harder and I'm reimagining that scenario today like I can't imagine now that a parent would be allowed to say that to their child without their child maybe opening up to a teacher or someone saying oh it's not it's a horrible way that you are abused you're being emotionally abused your parents should sit you down and discuss why it is that you run away and these feelings and emotions are valid and your your parents are doing the wrong thing I don't know maybe they'd find a threat on Tick Tock right maybe they would have to find a threat on Tick Tock about the emotional abuse the emotional neglect that you're experiencing and yet despite this it seems to me that we produced tougher children right despite the fact that now children are never being more heard or more validated in every emotional experience that they're having it doesn't seem to be working we aren't producing stronger children they're not able to deal with anything in the world take a listen to this because in considering this I remembered this clip of Louis CK you'll you guys remember Louis CK or no Louis CK he is a comedian he got me two so you don't see him around as much as you did a few years ago but it's one of my favorite clips of all time it's him discussing why he doesn't allow his children to have cell phones take a listen some parents really struggle with like all the other kids have the Father the Terrible Things So my kid has to yeah let's let you know let your kid go and be a better example to the kids stage isn't it just because it's the other stupid kids have phones doesn't mean that okay well my kid has to be stupid otherwise she'll feel weird right you know I I think these things are toxic I don't think especially for kids it's just this thing it's bad and they don't look at people when they talk to them and they don't build an empathy you know kids are mean and it's because they're trying it out they they look at a kid and they go you're fat and then they see the kid's face scrunch up and they go oh that doesn't feel good to make a person do that but they but they got to start with doing the mean thing but when they write your fat then they just go Um that was fun I like them that tasted good yeah exactly you need the thing is I you need to build an ability to just be yourself and not be doing something that's what the phones are taking away yes is the ability to just sit there like this that's being a person right yes no one can they've gotta you gotta check because you know underneath everything in your life there's that thing that empty forever empty you know what I'm talking about that yes yes yes I yes yes I acknowledge that it's all for nothing and you're alone you know it's down there and sometimes when things clear away you're not watching it you're in your car and you start going oh no here it comes that I'm alone like it starts to visit on you you know just the sadness yes life is tremendously sad just by you know being in it and so you're driving and then you go uh that's why we text and drive I look around pretty much 100 of people driving or texting yes and they're killing everybody's murdering each other with their cars yes but people are willing to risk taking a life and ruining their own because they don't want to be alone for a second because it's so hard I was in my car one time and Bruce Springsteen song comes on and I heard it and it gave me kind of like a fall back to school depression feel it made me really sad yeah and I go okay I'm getting sad I gotta get the phone and write hi to like 50 people people and then you know somebody cool writes back and then somebody not as cool writes after and I'm like [Laughter] hey how come you didn't answer my text yeah well right because he wrote first that's right so anyway I started to get that sad feeling I was reaching for the phone that I said you know what don't just be sad just let the sadness just stand in the way of it and let it hit you like a truck and I let it come and bruise and I just started to feel oh my God and I pulled over and I just cried like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] I cried so much and it was beautiful it was like this beautiful it's just this the sadness is poetic you're lucky to live sad moments and then I had happy feelings because because when you let yourself feel sad yes your body has like antibodies it has happiness that comes rushing in rushing in to meet the sadness so you're I was grateful to feel sad and then I met it with true profound happiness it was such a trip you know and the thing is because we don't want that first bit of sad yeah we pushed it away with like a little phone for the food and you get yeah you get a little kind of do you never feel completely sad or completely happy you just feel kind of satisfied with your products yes and then you die so that's why I don't want to get a phone for my kid I love love love that clip so much because I do think it speaks to this generation so much I think that it is why people believe that we are facing this Mental Health crisis every time a child has a feeling I think despite the fact that they have so many feelings what it really comes down to is they are overwhelmed by having an authentic feeling they somehow think that they are not required to ever be sad social media is depriving them of that there is it's depriving them of becoming experienced with natural emotions and so when they feel a natural emotion they become super anxious and they feel like they're having a breakdown because even as parents we are not allowing children to realize that sadness is a part of life right not every single feeling that you have is so legitimate that needs to be discussed for hours and hours and hours and this is sort of being reinforced by the edge education system which is almost over validating the feelings that mean nothing right and at the same time telling children that if they want to they can turn to their Technologies they can turn to tick tock to suspend emotions right there's almost this juxtaposition that's happening and so I think that a resolution to this and this goes back to my grandfather's generation and fortunately My Generation where we didn't have all of these social media apps is that we need to have tougher parents we need to have less people experiencing things on social media and instead experiencing things in the real world and really that's all that I have to say about that all right guys before we

he and I in Paris at his Yeezy fashion show wore t-shirts that said White lives matter and broke the internet actually the morning after when I saw him he said should we respond to it I actually were thinking that we should just say nothing about it and just appreciate the art of the response right he is among other things a fashion designer and an artist and so it was fun to really appreciate that the response was the art the response that we knew we were going to get was a commentary on Society of course because for years we were told that saying black lives matter was not divisive saying black lives matter was not a form of black Supremacy saying black lives matter was a righteous thing to say people were of course then okay with with people that said Asian lives matter because of course this phrase is not divisive you can just insert any except for white I don't know what happened there but those same individuals completely flip suddenly it became an expression of white supremacy it was not inclusive at all it wasn't saying anything it needed to go and I was comfortable to just allow people to scream and to shout and to appreciate the art in it but then Kanye decided that it was time to say something because he's not just an artist right he is more than that he has always been more than just an artist and a rapper and a producer and a fashion designer and he went on Tucker Carlson last night now you remember that everyone's been telling you but he's completely insane that he just does things that there's no thought behind it and you if you watched this segment on Tucker Carlson got a very different version of yay West take a listen so you just came from Paris Fashion Week you just landed in the lanyard and still on from it and there's a photograph on it what is that it's a photograph of a baby's ultrasound why is that and that you designed that yes why what does that mean it just represents life and pro-life boy so you wear it on a badge what kind of response do you get and good amen I agree I don't care about people's responses I care about the fact that there's more black babies being aborted and born in New York City at this point that 50 percent of black death in America is abortion so I really don't care about people's responses I perform for audience of one and that's God yeah that my favorite response because I kept on thinking like you know people they're looking for an explanation and people say well as an artist you don't have to give an explanation but as a leader you do yes I think that's right so the answer to why I wrote White lives matter on a shirt is because they do it's the obvious thing amazing incredibly measured and profound and it's profound in its Simplicity right they do it is true White lives matter black lives matter Asian lives matter all lives matter and unfortunately we live in a society that is unwilling to admit that it is a form of racism when you're only angry when you say White lives matter right you it is such a strange time to live in that people think that they are legitimate in treating white people as if they're not allowed to speak in society anymore and how profound and how measured is he in wearing this lanyard and speaking to under this understanding that what we do matters only to God right and what is happening in Black America is a form of genocide what is happening in terms of the abortion industry and its deep history uh related to Eugenics and Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood actually targeting black families what is happening is unacceptable it is such a cultural moment that he has the courage to go on Tucker Carlson and to hold the line and not to completely collapse because people on the left are basically demanding that he become silenced they no longer want him the people in fashion we covered this yesterday Gigi Hadid the big models are basically saying he needs to go he's just a bully people were completely silent right about the fact that people are describing as mentally ill imagine describing a black man who has the courage to speak out on the death industry that is abortion that's just somebody that's mentally ill and Disturbed right that's not a form of racism but they've remained silent on those topics and they only want to speak out because he wore a t-shirt that says white lives matter really really think about what that says about the state of things in America moving on it is I I actually can't even believe what I'm about to share with you it's incredible if you want to talk about Black America in the context of what Democrats believe to be true about Black America we are emotional Silly Putty we are thoughtless we are stupid and we are undeserving of a conversation they do not believe that we possess even a modicum of intelligence which is why every time it is around election season they go out to Rappers that's what they do they go out to rappers and they basically say can you make a video or do an interview and just tell the millions of other stupid people that follow you to vote and to do as we say this is what they do right notoriously cardi B Joe Biden gave essentially no interviews when he was running in 2020 using covet as an excuse but he did step out and do an interview with cardi B and it was a mockery there was there were no intelligent questions being asked of him but she had a huge following well it's mid-term season and they've gone out again to hip-hop artists this time Trina and an artist known as Saucy San antenna and they have asked them to produce this video a music video a song that's called No voting no bucking bucking spelled v-u-c-k-i-n-g but of course you know what it's supposed to mean the lyrics are essentially about how if you don't vote you're not going to be able to have sex take a listen [Music] was heavy okay so in case you missed the lyrics there they're on an app looking to have sex the lyrics are BLK app looking for some action swipe the homie Scott what's happening space is a nine ABS is a ten his D is a um to be determined he got mad jokes he don't seem broke the only red flag is he said he don't vote this midterm is for all the single cuties wanna hit this booty gotta do yo civic duty no vote in no [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is uh the explicit version the version that I'm looking at right now and the second verse goes on to say don't stop now stuff my Ballot Box again brought my homegirl through put the Buy in partisan okay I guess we're talking about bisexual sex now politics be so nasty make me wanna flirt you show you how to be a poll worker here's my I think this is the best part here goes on to say legs in the air I don't care anyone can get it Universal Health Care oh okay well guess promise you to promise cuty's great just I guess you have to if you want to be a [\u00a0__\u00a0] you got to vote that's the message here it goes on to say if you wanna come before the deadline come in this jacuzzi gerrymander this coochie foreign because if I wasn't laughing I'd be crying I mean it's just yeah gerrymander biscucci how's that Black America yeah we we're doing this because we're being inclusive not because we think you are so stupid that this is the only thing you'll respond to We Can't of course we can't just go to black people and say hey you should vote because it's your civic duty and it's incredibly important that you vote because the people that you put into office you're going to determine the future for you they're going to be controlling your tax dollars and they're going to be determining the future for your children no no no no no black Americans are too stupid for that give them no voting no [\u00a0__\u00a0] and to tell them that they should if they don't vote then they're not going to be able to have promiscuous sex on the BLK app and God forbid their coochies are not gerrymander I don't know I don't know I don't have to say to that um I don't know why black America is still not awake to the fact that we are considered stupid uh we are considered the dumbest race in America we are considered emotional Silly Putty they are laughing at us and they are using people that they laugh at to make us do even more ridiculous things to make us do their bidding I don't know why black America still can't see that but I'll keep reporting on it in the hopes that one day we might moving on from that I've got to discuss this mayor in New Orleans I I love this mayor in a way I don't know I think she's just she's amazingly audacious she's a Democrat mayor of course it's an inner city community and she recently got caught spending a lot of money thirty thousand dollars actually on some flights and those flights were not an economy they were first class tickets to France and to Switzerland and they said this is ridiculous you can't spend this kind of money mayor Latoya Cantrell and actually she said that she could and the reason that she could is because um it would be unsafe for black people to fly an economy I don't know take a listen to what else she said all expenses incur doing business on behalf of the City of New Orleans will not be reimbursed to the City of New Orleans one thing is clear I do my job and I will continue to do it with distinction with dignity and integrity every step of the way and so that's what I'll have to say on that and so that's what she has to say on that and one thing is clear right one thing is clear economy class flights are just not safe for black women and so she flew herself in first class okay she did because it's unsafe you know their food is not that good in economy okay it's just not it is unsafe for us to consume a meal that is not more safe in first class I actually love this policy I'm gonna run it up to the Daily wire I do think that they should be paying for me to fly in first class all the time because I'm black and it is unsafe it is unsafe for me to fly anywhere else a quick update to that story actually it turns out she's going to have to reimburse the city because they don't really care about this ridiculous notion that she's not safe and it just was not legal for her to be purchasing those flights they have policies on top of that if you think that's audacious they have also found that she is staying in a property a luxurious apartment that is owned by the city she's just been staying there she just decided to allow herself in there she's not allowed to be living there but she likes the digs better at this flat that is owned by the city and so now they're investigating her for that and I'm sure that she will end up having to potentially recompensate them for staying there illegally and I'm sure that she will say um excuse me her health and her safety is being disregarded she would rather stay in luxurious digs because staying in our own homes is unsafe yeah how about that you guys we're unsafe It's hard out there for black people uh moving on and in this topic and uh in this furthering conversation that we are having about Black America and all the frauds that exist in Black America all people that keep extracting these various Notions like this mayor Latoya Cantrell that black Americans are suffering and therefore we should should not look any further right don't look don't dig beneath the surface at all just listen to us tell you BS listen to us say as we did during the black lives matter campaign that you should just accept us riding and looting and burning down our own communities by the way this is where we live except it looked the other way don't call it criminality because I don't know we're we're suffering in some regard well as you guys know and you may have seen online I have just dropped the documentary to uh the documentary trailer pardon uh to my black lives matter documentary which is entitled George Floyd the greatest lie ever sold and in case you haven't seen it I'm going to share it with you right now so black lives matter released their 990 IRS filing they collected 80 million dollars where is that money it's not here everything looks worse than it was I mean that money impacted throughout the city so my producer just sent me a link it is just shocking to me because of how much money was raised to think that where he lives the bills weren't being covered super frustrating but that's a dead end so and here's where it gets really interesting ready for some BLM Pride [Music] another 200k went to escorts BDSM workers strippers Peep Show workers phone sex operators and webcam performers and then at that moment it became personal and I thought not only am I going to say the truth I am going to scream the truth louder than you can stream the lies I am going to scream the truth louder than they can scream alive because I am just annoyed that people think we're going to move on from that entire scenario I am beyond excited to bring you guys this documentary it was something that I actually brought to the Daily wire I sat down I said I want to do this I want to look in to this obvious scam and there's a scam in the way that it has divided America it is a scam in the way that it has silenced white Americans it is a scam in the way that it has promoted criminality and harmed black communities and so nope I am not going to let it go please you guys if you haven't yet get ready to watch that documentaries dropping October 12th next Wednesday and I am just asking everyone to respectfully wear black when you watch it because it's going to be black lives matters funeral and that's all I have to say about that all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about Biden pardoning all prior Federal offenses of simple marijuana possession so if you are not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "Xv2s_JBdGFk": "okay guys question of the day today it's a really important one and I want you to think deeply about it do you believe that your government would intentionally harm you have you ever at all considered that to be a plausibility plus later on in the show I'm going to reveal some disturbing news about the CDC the World Health Organization and Bill Gates definitely do not want you to know about all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] thank you [Music] thank you okay so before we jump into the question I want to at first thank all of you guys for your support regarding the birth episode that we did to launch this new podcast as many of you guys know I have fallen way down the rabbit hole when it comes to Big Pharma and I am so aware so keenly aware that virtually everything they do is to make money that they would very much at the expense of you at the expense of me at the expense of our children they want to make money and that really was the story of my birth just trying to leave the hospital and of course no no no they want to keep you for 48 hours and charge you for every single knock any person who has given birth in a hospital knows exactly what I'm talking about when I say that and if you don't know what I'm talking about go back and have a listen to my birth story people also know I have been probably the only person that has been extremely vocal in the media about the fact that I did not I chose not after learning a lot about the history of vaccines uh to vaccinate either of my children and I think that I'm fortunate that I'm making that decision Society has been primed to have that discussion meaning that in the pre-covered era I think a lot of parents would have said that is lunacy me among them by the way growing up I am obviously fully vaxxed in terms of the schedule that was impressed upon me from my parents and doctors but I was injured by a vaccine when I was about 20 years old and that woke me up to the fact that I really didn't know anything about vaccines and I just trusted doctors blanketly and it made me want to conduct my own research when the time came for me to have children in that time I just poured myself into knowing how every vaccine came about and it really was the same strategy that we saw during the years of covet It Was Fear very little information but you should be fearful your child is going to die roll up your sleeve and do the right thing and I because I am now tethered with information and because I embarked on this journey I made a decision that it wasn't necessary for my children to be vaccinated now many of you guys have asked the question canis are you going to bring a shot in the dark that is my Series going over every single vaccine that is on the child's schedule that I did on parlor the social media app you can go and you can check that out parlor.com you can go right to my wall if you will I'm parlor.com Candace and you can watch 11 episodes of me unpacking how I came about the decision not to wax my children and I just take you guys through by the way the CDC documents and the FDA documents I'm not going through some some obscure channels or finding information that wouldn't be readily available to you I include the links so that you can also look them up and just tether yourself to reality but as I said a lot of you guys have been asking me about it are you going to bring it to daily wire plus the answer is yes I am going to talk about that because it is such a sensitive discussion and we don't want the daily wire to be banned you know you're not allowed to talk openly against big Pharma and against the medical cartel it does have to be behind the paywall we are still working on how that will work I will likely team up with Dr Robert Malone because he has expressed interest in being a part of that discussion making sure parents are informed what I ultimately believe in by the way is just informed consent making sure that you know what is going on before you necessarily or unnecessarily submit your children to a big Pharma and their schedule so anyways back to the question of the day and why I'm bringing all this up I asked you do you believe the government would intentionally harm you and that question is especially pertinent after covid after recognizing that the government was trying to force people to inject a vaccine into their body uh let's not forget Joe Biden the president of the United States then trying to basically Force every single person you're not going to be able to go to work remember that you're not gonna be able to go to work unless you agree to get vaccinated against a an illness a virus that has a virtual 99 chance of survival think about that nope you're not going to be able to go to work you're not going to be able to put food on the table gloriously locking down businesses all of these things that we saw and you said really and now of course it's magically allegedly according to Joe Biden even though they've walked back his com his comments covet is over right the pandemic is over how is it just suddenly over what changed I know I never got vaccinated so how can they just say it's magically over it's almost almost like it was political but of course if it was political then that begs the question would our government intentionally harm us right I read an incredible piece incredible piece that we need to discuss that was in The Spectator UK it is something that I read often I just wanted to bring this piece to your Consciousness because this is going to happen in America we're already seeing the beginning of it it is regarding the topic of of euthanasia so medically people are walking into clinics and killing themselves this is legal in Switzerland they are having a debate that is waging across Europe about this as I told you the other day should you be allowed to kill yourself now most Americans and when we had this discussion the other day wrote comments to me and said Candice that's for the terminally ill you're not educated about this a couple of people actually wrote this to me you're not educated about this and I commented back and I said no you're not educated about this the fact that you believe that this is about terminal illness and this is about compassion uh is exactly what the government wants you to believe of course the slope is always slippery and this article tells us just how slippery it is it's talking specifically about Canadian law and if you didn't know since last year Canadian law has allowed both the rich as well as the poor to kill themselves if they just don't want to continue living some people are deciding that they are too poor to continue living but they say now you can die with dignity dignity is the word that they keep using it's about oh you can't have a life of dignity so wouldn't you just rather die right it's not even you don't have a life of dignity if you're poor and I want to focus on just that term dignity because the left does that over and over and over again it is always a game of euphemisms they make something sound pretty and something sound flowery right how can we make death sound flowery to Americans and like the right thing to do oh I know we'll call abortion pro-choice doesn't that sound better than saying that mothers are reaching inside of their wombs and pulling their children out because I don't know if you're Michelle Williams you you have a career in Hollywood and you're not ready to have a kid and you want to get a trophy a statue you hope you can win an Emmy or an Oscar so you're making a choice it's Reproductive Rights flowery terms also for the the trans children it's gender affirming care what a lovely lovely way to say that you are chemically castrating children gender affirming care we'll talk more about that later social justice even that term it's so lovely sounding right you feel like you're skipping through flowers in a field social justice of what we actually mean is black lives matter is outside and they're going to burn down the place for social justice and not Pursuit but it's social justice so I guess they can just keep saying that back to Canada so now we we're going to start hearing this term more and more about dying with Dignity right to you you can no longer have this life with dignity so so Canada has done this and the way that they did this I want to unpack the history of this so the Supreme Court of Canada used to have a law that banned assisted suicide it used to just be unconstitutional in 2015 they reversed that ban so they had all of these years of jurisprudence and they said nope never mind we're going to undo it and people were reasonably fearful right they said of course we should not do this because the slope will get slippery and you will have people that are just going to kill themselves people that are vulnerable that are just going to say I'm going to kill myself and the Supreme Court of Canada said ah those are just anecdotal examples plus again this is back in 2015. uh we are only making this assisted suicide available for people who suffer from a terminal illness or whose natural death was reasonably foreseeable so this is where the American conscience is right now it's like okay well we're talking about that are terminally ill people that we know are going to die rather than having them suffer we're allowing them to take a pill and to kill themselves there's an example of this in Oregon there was a girl who took a pill because she was in so much pain with a rare brain brain cancer that she had right oh except that wasn't enough it took only five years for them to say you know what this um terminal illness stuff and this reasonably foreseeable death it's not really necessary so in 2020 the Canadian Parliament enacted bill c-7 which was a sweeping euthanasia law that repealed that requirement right you no longer had to be in a condition that was determined to be terminal and you no longer had to have reasonably foreseeable death upon you now you just had to be someone that is suffering from an illness or a disability which quote cannot be relieved under conditions that you would consider acceptable that really cranks it open hey just conditions that you would consider acceptable and they can't relieve them so now it's okay to take advantage of what is known euphemistically of course as medical assistance in dying that is made for short and by the way the government will kill you for free for free this is actually happening in Canada we will take care of the costs don't you worry if you feel that you are a burden and you cannot necessarily relieve these burdens in your life we will pay for you to die with dignity right and so of course Canadians all across the country began opting into this now of course this is being abused and I'm going to give you just one example a man that had a neurodegenerative disease testified to the Canadian Parliament that nurses and a medical ethicist whatever that is at a hospital tried to coerce him into killing himself by threatening to bankrupt him with extra costs they also withheld water from him for 20 days this is inside of a hospital you should kill yourself you should kill yourself if you know if you don't kill yourself you're not even able to afford to live because your insurance is not going to cover this this is exactly by the way even though it wasn't euthanasia what happened in the hospital when I wanted to leave they basically told me that you if you leave the hospital and you don't stay for 48 hours we're gonna mark this down and your insurance may not cover the entire birth that you just had that is a thuggery that is taking place in hospitals in America now for people that are giving birth and that is a thuggery that is taking place in hospitals in Canada this man testified because they wanted him to kill himself we no longer want you to be here you can't afford this goodbye as another example a woman in Ontario was forced into euthanasia because her housing benefits did not allow her to get better housing which should not aggravate her crippling allergies and there was another woman a disabled woman who applied to die because she simply could not afford to keep on living so being poor right that's the pitch you're poor and of course their media has assisted in this they have state-sponsored media which is trying to make people think that this is a good thing that this is a compassionate thing that suicide actually suicide assisted by your government assisted by the hospitals is something that should be aspired to now why well because they figured out that poor people are costly right they actually discussed the parliament discuss the fiscal advantages of Bill C7 they ran the numbers they figured out that they could save an extra 62 million dollars per year if they just removed this barrier of thinking that people needed to be terminally ill in fact just allowing euthanasia to take place in general uh saved the country 86.9 million dollars per year so that's the pitch those who have to rely wholly on government provided Medicare pose a far greater burden on the government of course this could reasonably happen in America I could see this pitch especially to Black America who has fallen for pitches before of the government saying that you need to be the first people on the front lines fighting Against Racism as they like to call it and of course it's never actually racism that we're fighting but we get all fired up by that word I could see the government pitching to Black America that it would be racist not to allow us to kill ourselves right just like they say at random times that the abortion industry is good for black Americans and to not allow abortion is especially harmful and racist to black Americans right it's black Americans that have killed their offspring 18 over 18 million black babies have been aborted since 1973. also I as I mentioned is because the media is making it seem like it's cool right the media is making it seem like it's the right thing to do this is when the celebrities come into play mask up save lives right there's always a concert effort and a campaign to propagandize these more Sinister efforts now in case you think this would never happen to us Canada is just to the north of course it could if Europe is debating it if if Switzerland has already made it legal and if America is already talking about expanding that legislation then of course it's going to happen unless you forget there were already two women perfectly healthy that were not terminally ill that killed themselves they lived in Arizona they got on a plane two sisters their names were Lila Amore she was 54 years old and Susan Fraser just 46 years old randomly got up they both had jobs they both lived in nice houses they took a plane they told their friends and colleagues that they were just going on a trip in Europe and they killed themselves in Switzerland they had a team of medical professionals that assisted them in killing themselves because they just wanted to die so to go back to that question of whether or not you think that your government would intentionally harm you you better deeply consider the answer to that question because it is your children it is our children are going to have to grow up in this world if we do not start having these questions and really examining our government's agenda all right guys before we jump into new stories today I want to talk to you about good ranchers you guys have heard me sing good ranchers Praises time and time again they deliver pasture-raised grass-fed and grain finished meat right to your door and everything is hand cut and trimmed which makes meal prep super easy you might not know this but a lot of grocery store meat is dairy cattle which is incredibly low quality poor quality meat can carry bacteria which is why meat recalls happen all the time in the grocery stores good ranchers only sells cut from American Angus beef cattle and unlike the grocery store they have you 100 satisfaction guaranteed so go to goodranchors.com Candace at checkout you'll get 30 off your first order of American Meat delivered plus free shipping that's go to ranchers.com canis and use code Candace at checkout okay now it's time for some topics [Music] first up we have my friend and colleague Matt Walsh who has been really being the drum on these trans clinics that are geared toward children it's obviously a topic that he's passionate about I think he's got like 1 million children and a passionate a topic that I have also been passionate about so he did something he uncovered shocking details about Vanderbilt University's medical centers so-called gender affirming care don't forget these are popping up all across the nation you have hospitals that are now focused on affirming the gender to use a flowery phrase of children and also of adults vulnerable adults I would say so Vanderbilt opened its trans clinic in 2018 during a lecture the same year a doctor Shane Taylor explained how she convinced Nashville to get into the gender transition business she emphasized by the way that it's a big money maker especially because the surgeries require a lot of follow-ups Oh Wow Let's Hear Dr Shane Taylor in her own words a female to male bottom surgeries these are huge money makers again I think this has to be an underestimate that they're voting around twenty thousand dollars for a phalloplasty there's been different things that I've read that said it could be up to a hundred thousand dollars um Dr lineker who's our surgeon said that there's entire Clinic where the entire Clinic is supported just by their falloplasties and that is like a fraction of the surgeries that they're doing these surgeries are labor-intensive there are a lot of follow-ups they require a lot of or time and they make money they make money for the hospital it's just so disgusting how flimp it flippant she is in her demeanor right he's like oh this by the way this is great it's actually going to make us a lot of money I think these are Under estimates these are Under I think we're going to make even more money because there's so many follow-up visits and because these people you're immutable in their bodies of course and of course they then end up in a cycle where they have to keep going back to the hospitals for follow-ups because they need more medicine to deal and to cope with various other things that are happening because they're mutilating their own bodies the consequences of mutilating your own body requires follow-ups and of course she loves it she thinks it's great right she sounds so open about it she's like she's pitching this as if it's a good thing again I revert back to my birth story and recognizing that that hospitals are businesses they're not places where you traditionally go to get care anymore right as soon as you walk through the door they see profit signs and that by the way is not to castigate all of the amazing doctors and nurses that work within our healthcare industry I believe they get into it the majority of them because they want to help but they are stepping into an ecosystem that thinks like this that thinks what are the profits how do we make them if you think that's bad there is also a video from Dr Ellen Clayton she is a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt and she talks about how doctors that might be objecting like they might go actually doing this goes against my conscience yeah she thinks that's a bad thing take a listen if you were going to assert conscientious objection you have to realize that that is problematic you are doing something to another person and you are not paying for the cost for your belief I think that is a real I mean I think that's a real issue how sick is that how sick is that she's basically saying if you are going to assert your conscience into what you're doing maybe you're a little uncomfortable because you realize that you're giving a child drugs that could alter them for the rest of their lives right A drugs like puberty blockers which they don't have long studies into but which other people who have been on those Beauty blockers are speaking out we covered on a previous show a mom saying that her child developed a micro penis right and has is basically asexual has no normal sexual functions or desires because they were on these drugs for a very long time yeah if you as a doctor inject your conscience into this it's it's problematic okay your job is to Simply look at the person as a number and to do what you need to do to make sure that our Hospital can continue to make and earn money we don't need to hear about your conscience anymore mutilate the child mutilate the adult we don't need to hear that's not what we hired you for that's what I get from that video it's disgusting I'm so proud that Matt Walsh as a friend and colleague has been looking into these hospitals locally but understand that you should be doing this too this is likely happening at a hospital near you and unless parents start to put pressure or start to investigate this stuff is just not ever going to see the light of day because he put pressure and now I should mention as an update that Matt Walsh is also working with the Congress and the House Republicans here to make sure that we put a stop to this but because this saw the light of day the governor of Tennessee governor Bill Lee issued a statement to daily wire calling for a thorough investigation he said quote the Pediatric transgender clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center raises serious moral ethical and legal concerns we should not allow permanent life-altering decisions that hurt children or policies that suppress religious Liberties offer the purpose of financial gain we have to protect Tennessee children and this warrants a thorough investigation um that's a good start I think and it's but I want to say it's not just the children it's not just a transgender it is the entire model of hospitals today that requires an investigation not just my birth it's the entire model is no longer about getting the individual healthy it's no longer about making sure the individual stays healthy mentally or physically which means that these are dark days ahead of us if we don't do something about it regarding Vanderbilt by the way obviously they never thought that this was going to save a light today what they did was they removed its entire Adult and Children's transgender Clinic websites along with their program for lgbtq health from their web pages Vanderbilt has issued a statement that says there's misinformation ooh fun let this buzzword surrounding the story but no they have not actually factually disputed anything that was said they just using the buzzword it's Miss some there's misinformation there's some information that could be missing so but we're not going to give it to you we're not going to tell you what it actually is moving on let's talk about the CDC the CDC has estimated that the number of patients that are going to need anticoagulants is expected to double by 2050 so anticoagulants that's regarding blood clotting that's a medical term for blood clots per the CDC website deep vein thrombosis which is a blood clot located in the deep vein is usually in a leg or an arm or pulmonary embolisms which is a blood clot that has traveled from a deep vein to a lung yeah they're just expecting that all to double by 2050. why why I'll ask a question not give an answer why are we seeing so many young people and older people get blood clots all of a sudden this is not something that was happening but they certainly are going to Gaslight you into thinking that it is happening here's actually a quote from The Epic Times uh from a licensed embalmer his name is uh Larry Mills he said quote we as embalmers are seeing some strange clots since the covet outbreak these clots are very rubbery feeling and very long as they exit the veins that we use during the embalming procedure they really appear to be like earthworms I have never seen this in my career until now Mills said why why he's not the only only person that has come out there are also other Funeral Directors or embalmers that want to maintain their enemy because they don't know how the funeral houses are going to react uh there's one that said I can tell you with certainty that the clots that Richard has shown online are a phenomenon that I have not witnessed until probably the middle of last year as pretty much all I have to say about it I have no knowledge as to what is causing the clots but they did seemingly start showing up around the middle of 2021. that quote was from a licensed embalmer he's been licensed since 2001 by the way he goes on to say you can rest assured that the clots we are seeing are not something we ever saw prior to last year now what's interesting to me is how careful they are in their words that they feel that they have to be anonymous if they feel that they have to say we don't know where it's coming from you can sense that there is this much pressure that is happening in the medical industry right we saw this during covet doctors and nurses felt they couldn't speak out about what they were seeing that they could not say hey yes some people are getting sick from covet but we're seeing this primarily in obese people right that they could not say that they didn't view this as a threat to children because according to the statistics it just wasn't they all feel like they have to get in line for various reasons because they are scared that their licenses are going to be revoked if they don't follow obscure rules and it it really begs the question regarding their Hippocratic oath I was constantly thinking how can you even consider yourself to be a doctor or a nurse anymore when you're just scared and you do things that you don't know whether or not it is harming another person but simply because you are told if you want to keep your job or if you want Insurance uh uh to still work with you then you are going to have to act in this certain capacity that is what we have seen over and over and over again in the same vein a licensed funeral director and Apprentice embalmer who has been in the funeral industry for over three years and has participated in over 200 embalming said this it's a quote during May of 2021 the embalming process became more difficult the normal draining of the blood was almost halted by thick jelly-like blood instead of the blood flowing normally down the table it was very viscous so thick that it would not wash down the table without assistance that's what she told The Epic Times And as time passed since the vaccines were distributed she has seen more of the thick blood as well as thick fibrous like clots think about that she says the clots are not only clotting the veins but the arteries as well and she explained that normal embalming usually takes around two hours but now it can take up to four hours because they're having this difficulty with the blood flowing she said quote the distribution of the arterial fluid is being blocked by these clots and making my job more difficult the clots are so large and thick that with the flow of the arterial solution massage and manipulation of the artery or vein is necessary for removal I am able to assist some of the large clots with forceps and quotes there's also been many families that have reported that their loved ones of course have died of sudden heart attacks embolisms and blood clots and many families that have stated that their family members had no health issues prior to receiving the vaccine you guys you've seen this time and time again these stories just keep coming out you may even know somebody who suddenly got the vaccine and went through something I reported very early um on the miscarriages that my friends were suffering after getting vaccines but I want to be very clear guys that there is no known correlation right don't you don't even think about it don't be a conspiracy theorist there is no known correlation in fact the mainstream media says this could be happening because of covet itself or my favorite term covid-induced stress locked down stress is what's causing all of these healthy young people to be going through things like multiple miscarriages lockdown induce stress is likely what's leading to young people that are getting brain clots and blood clots is likely what's leading to this cream easy thing of these embalmers and people that work in funeral homes seeing things they've never seen ever it's probably just a little bit of extra stress guys don't ever for a single second uh think that your government is lying to you that would make you a conspiracy theorist right this same woman went on to say that her father was vaccinated with the moderna vaccine and two weeks later he had emergency surgery for blood clots in his popliteal artery after a second vaccine dose he was hospitalized with more clots he had surgery a second time and the third time he almost died my father had to have a complete bypass in his leg she said during my father's hospitalization my best friend's father was having emergency surgery at the same hospital for a massive heart attack which he suffered weeks after receiving his vaccine unfortunately we can not add any veracity to her claims the only people that are authorized to say whether or not that's true or not are like Dr fauci maybe Dr Burks the CDC these unelected bureaucrats that somehow dictated that a bunch of people had to get vaccines against their will if they wanted to go back to work I think those are the only people that can officially comment on what they're seeing and that's all I have to say about that moving on to another story which you need to be paying attention to our White House another executive order signed executive order on advancing biotechnology and bio manufacturing Innovation for a you're gonna love it sustainable safe and secure American bioeconomy there we go guys euphemisms pay attention sustainable safe that means it is something that you need to look into because it's probably the opposite Joe Biden quietly signed an order on Monday September 12th and this is from the actual document ready quote for biotechnology and bio manufacturing to help us achieve our societal goals the United States needs to invest in foundational scientific capabilities we need to develop genetic engineering Technologies and techniques to be able to write circuitry for cells and predictably program biology in the same way in which we write software and program computers unlock the power of biological data including through Computing tools and artificial intelligence in advance the science of scale-up production while reducing the obstacles for commercialization so that Innovative Technologies and products can reach markets faster I'm sorry what this is exactly what biotech is all about it's in the name biotech right they want access to your biology to begin inserting technology it is the reason why I needed no further explanation I knew that I was not getting the coveted vaccine I don't like biotech it's not for me call me crazy call me old-fashioned but I want autonomy over my own body and I don't need my body to read like a computer software maybe you do maybe some people want to line up and say Yes turn me into a computer I it would just be easier if there was just things available at my biology that read like a technology again not for me this was quiet they signed this quietly they didn't want this to really make the mainstream they shouldn't worry about it because the mainstream media never covers what they do there are in fact no they always cover what they do by never covering it if you know what I mean I think this woman summed it up pretty nicely in a tweet this is a tweet from Karen Kingston she said regarding that White House document let me read between the lines for America Biden September 12 2022 executive order declares that Americans must surrender all human rights that stand in the way of transhumanism clinical trial safety standards and informed consent will be eradicated as they stand in the way of universally unleashing Gene editing Technologies needed to merge humans with artificial intelligence in order to achieve the societal goals of the New World Order crimes against humanity are not only legal but mandatory yeah I would say that seems to be the direction we're headed toward but that would make me a conspiracy theorist so I'm I'm not going to say that I'm going to just let her say that because God forbid we start paying attention to the obvious signs that something is very very wrong happening in our society and all around the world the Free World is not seeming to be so free anymore to you does it seem free to you I go back to the question that I asked you earlier do you think that your government has the capacity to harm you that your government would intentionally harm you that your government would intentionally lie to you ask yourself that question continue to ask yourself that question moving on this is a headline in EV magazine the world economic Forum wants to make you allergic to beef and Bill Gates has the mosquitoes to do it I want to be very clear here the mainstream media tells us that Bill Gates is a good guy and so it must be true so what if his name seems to be in the middle of a bunch of medical scandals so what if various countries have accused him of crimes against humanity so what if so many people believe that he is actually harming people via his vaccine incentives that is that's all a lie it's all conspiracy he's a really good guy who happened to be on Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs but who cares he's a good guy he cares about you so I want you to know this about Bill Gates the great guy in 2004 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation began funding the world mosquito program and their quote wolbachia work through Grand challenges and Global health program okay that's the program is called this specific program breeds and releases mosquitoes that are infected with wolbachia bacteria this bacteria prevents mosquitoes from passing on deadly diseases such as Dengue fever and also shortens their lifespan the wmp has since released mosquitoes in Australia Vietnam Brazil Indonesia Colombia Fiji Mexico New Caledonia and Sri Lanka the article goes on to explain that with an artificially created consumer base through mosquito-induced Alpha gal syndrome governmental public policy Bill Gates could manipulate the public into consuming massive amounts of fake meat he'd essentially be creating his own food economy through influencing demand and supply and as the largest private Farmland owner in the U.S this wouldn't be a difficult feat for him imagine that I mean that sounds crazy right because they've got to have it wrong in this article why would Bill Gates who is the largest Farmland owner in the United States and has been trying to impress upon us that we should not eat real meat and also happens to operate a bunch of mosquitoes that are carrying around bacteria why would he do that why would he make us allergic to beef that's got to be a conspiracy theory that can't be right don't think for you allow the media to think for you allow the media who are so clearly working with your government thing for you allow them to sell to you in five years I guess if we are following Canada in five years that euthanasia against just a terminally ill is wrong and actually poor people even should be allowed to kill themselves allow them to convince you that one two three four coveted vaccines that they just change the definition of because the long-lasting definition of vaccines are no longer acceptable allow them to convince you that even though you're not immune to covid it's still a good thing for you to roll up your sleeve and get four of them just keep allowing the government to convince you of stuff just to spend thinking roll up your sleeve and abide by everything your government wants because I'm sure they want what's best for you and that's all I have to say about that all right guys the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on the recent Trump lawsuit and I'll be sharing how I told my husband that I was pregnant so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "GZKw1UcDO0I": "how could we not talk about the hashtag Twitter files there's something going on I don't know why by the way Elon Musk decided to drop this on Friday I feel like that was mean like I feel like everyone's like I'm gonna go into the weekend gonna hang out and just relax and I don't have to pay too much attention to the news cycle and then Twitter's like and and then Elon Musk is like 6 p.m tonight I'm dropping the files to prove uh what we already knew to be fair we did already know this it just feels like we're finally getting our confirmation obviously we know that people at the higher ups over at Twitter were engaged in a ton of censorship trying to get Joe Biden elected we knew that Twitter was being run by activists at that time and that they were willing to censor the truth to make sure that Hunter Biden's laptops the contents of it at least and all the communications on there did not impact the election cycle well he has made that abundantly clear in a Twitter thread which he shows that officials working over at the DNC would quite literally flag tweets send send it over to Twitter Executives and say hey could you get rid of these tweets and they would do it they would oblige them because again these were activists despite the fact that it was all real and that we knew that it was the truth they were locking accounts my accounts among them for sharing the incestuous texts which implied that Hunter Biden was being accused of engaging in sexual activities with his niece and that he was worried that it was going to break into the mainstream I shared that and now I understand why it was locked down they had a strategy for how to make sure none of that information entered the mainstream and it was by pretending that they didn't want to victimize people that this can be seen as victimization of some sort and so yes it's nice to get that confirmation I imagine a lot of lawsuits are going to happen um because of these confirmations because of him releasing these Twitter files and of course the left is just saying how could he possibly do this the real victims in this are the names of the Twitter employees who were just doing their job and now they're going to have to worry about death threats oh like forget the death of democracy forget the fact that we have Twitter engaging in trying to engineer election results that's not important the more important thing is that whoever it is the no-name employee at Twitter is protected at all costs not that that person should be probably probably locked up and that people should actually have to face charges for interfering with an election not that we have proof that our elections are no longer fair and free because we have these social media companies that have so much power over the conversation over the national conversation becomes because it has become the true means of communication no don't worry about all that let's be upset that there are employees whose names were released in to the uh Universe I guess so that doesn't make any sense to me but that is what the left is saying they're very upset that their these names have been released into the public sphere all right I have a question for you who is going to raise your kids if you are not around to raise them you know as well as I do that none of us are going to live forever and it's dark to think

you feel good news stories and I'm trying really hard there's just everything is sad everything is bad but this was at least very interesting and it's not sad or bad it's only interesting because I know about this because I have a pair of identical twins in my family I'll back this up by saying that I had a friend in college who was I thought it was rather arbitrary she was very very afraid of identical twins she's just like I don't know they just freaked me out like she did not want to be friends bendical twins she was like they just freaked me out and I'd be like what are you talking about man why are you so afraid about Michael twin she's like Candace it's the same person twice that's weird and the more I think about I'm like yeah it's like a clone just looking at a clone of an individual and they are connected they're just a split cell they're connected and they have all sorts of things that happen throughout their lives that are strange so my cousins who are medical twins one of them got into a car accident and at the exact same time her identical twin sister jumped up in a class and was like I believe I have to leave something's wrong like these are kind of the weird things that happen when you're identical twin well this is a true story a pair of identical twins have been handed a 1.5 million uh settlement in Damages by a college in South Carolina after the college wrongly accused them of cheating in a medical exam as the Court ruled that their their answers were identical because their minds were connected how how crazy is that yeah so Kayla and Kelly Bingham they're 30 years old they were initially enrolled at the Medical University of South Carolina to fulfill their dreams of one day becoming doctors well they took a medical exam and they had all of the exact same answers yeah that actually happened the entire said that it was virtually impossible for her and Kayla to see each other's computer screens despite the fact that there was only a distance of four or five feet between them so they thought okay these girls were tweeting well it turns out I mean we're cheating it turns out that they weren't actually cheating at all and that they had to have all of these psychologists and behavior Genesis that specialized in the study of twins to testify to clear their names and these girls weren't cheating they're just the same person twice they're just clones so of course if there's two canis owenses and we're both having to decide what stories to cover today we're both gonna go oh let's cover that one because we're the same person we're just the same person twice so that's pretty amazing I know that was a funny fun story and at least it's not anything that's sad so there you go all right guys next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus I'm going to be talking about my thoughts on Nick Fuentes so if you're not a member yet go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music]", "oVIvLdiC-3c": "[Music] all right so question of the day why are women crazy i mean i feel like i can't be the only person that is realizing right now that in the press and the stories that we're reading this seems to be the year of the crazy women i mean i know in chinese zodiac it's the year of the dragon but in america it feels like maybe women were pretending to be sane for a while but now they're just going all out and going bonkers and it's all just sort of being revealed you know for example yesterday we of course covered notoriously kim kardashian who had us believing for almost two decades that she was a victim oh i'm scared i'm a victim of pornography you know actually she was the perpetrator of pornography her own pornography herself as an actress in a porn film also of course this year who could forget the amber heard scaries the amber heard i'm so scared i'm a victim johnny depp hashtag me too hashtag time's up give me a way to promote myself even further and give me all these opportunities on the red carpet hashtag just kidding i'm a liar a little bit of a psychopath a little gone girl i actually i was i was bludgeoning johnny depp and then aside from bludgeoning johnny depp i was then threatening him that he was basically a wimp if he told anybody about it so yeah that's a thing i feel this year that women are just being outwardly crazy not all of them of course not me of course but other women seem to be on their eve i mean adam and eve i'm talking they are doing a lot of clinically insane things and so i started thinking about this topic and i wanted to see if there were symptoms that we could identify of maybe this chick is crazy i mean what do all of these crazy chicks have in common what do they have in common and here is what i realized there are four things you should look out for number one she's feminist af i'm a feminist i'm a feminist guys i don't do anything bad i love women i'm here to support women number two did i mention i'm a feminist because like i'm a feminist i'm definitely a feminist number three she over utilizes the word attack it felt like an attack what i would say is i was attacked we must stop these attacks like i just i don't know why this in their little dictionary of crazy is a word they are told to use i do think they're all being passed around dictionary and that word attack you will see all the time you'll hear it a lot number four you will realize that she's in a lot of problematic relationships she just seems to have trouble with productive relationships so i want to really underscore this point about the year of the crazy woman by pointing to some recent cultural examples that keep popping up in the press that i want you to be paying attention to number one olivia wilde what do you know about olivia wilde well i'll tell you the first thing you need to know is that olivia wilde is a feminist and if you didn't know she was a feminist check this picture out of her wearing a shirt that says feminist okay and in case this shirt is not making clear that she's a feminist she also once upon a time wore this skirt and the skirt if you can't read it and you're listening to this podcast it says feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist but hello it's like 300 times around the skirt in case you missed it olivia wilde is a feminist and in case you are someone who only speaks english she also wore this yes that is olivia wilde wearing a shirt that in french reads solidarte feminine i don't know if i'm saying that right because i don't speak french but i'm pretty sure it means that she's a feminist and in case that wasn't abundantly clear to you that she was a feminist just check her out wearing this [\u00a0__\u00a0] hat yeah there she is there she is she's a feminist guys and it's pink because girls like pink she's a feminist okay so you've heard me talk about how important it is to have a vpn to protect your online privacy but choosing the right vpn is equally as important i like to research my sponsors and i only recommend brands to my listeners i actually believe in and use and i can say with full confidence that expressvpn is the best vpn on the market and here is why number one especially apn doesn't log your activity online lots of cheap or free vpns make money by selling your

extra three months free on a one year package that's expressvpn e-x-p-r-e-s-s candice visit expressvpn.com candace to learn more now of course like all good feminists olivia sometimes gets attacked by men and she usually likes to get attacked by men when she's trying to further her career so olivia wilde had a long relationship she has two children and about a 10-year relationship with an actor named jason sedakis and it was convenient for her she had a movie that she was directing and producing that is called don't worry darling and in wanting to do press for this movie it was convenient for her that she was going through this separation with jason sudeikis and a processor served her papers while she was at uh comic-con i believe yeah cinemacon rather and so because this processor served her papers in public which by the way has happened since the beginning of time that processors like to do this because they know for a fact that a celebrity will be on a red carpet uh there was a dj named french montana who got served at a club because he was making an appearance when it happens to olivia wilde it is an attack and it is an attack that can be used to promote her movie so she gave this statement about being served papers relating to custody over their children she said quote it was my workplace in any other workplace it would be seen as an attack it was really upsetting it shouldn't have been able to happen there was a huge breach in security which is really scary it's scary that's very scary when a processor comes to serve you papers the hurdles that you had to jump through to get into that room with several badges plus special covet tests that had to be taken days in advance which gave you wristbands that were necessary to gain access to the event this was something that required forethought yeah she's under attack guys and she was really really scared because these papers were handed to her in a professional manner and like i said she's on a special snowflake this has happened many times in the past to celebrities but it happened to a woman who is also did i mention a feminist she goes on to say i hated that this nastiness distracted from the work of so many different people and the studio that i was up there representing to try to sabotage that was really vicious but i had a job to do i'm not easily distracted oh wow she is just so brave what a brave feminist woman olivia wilde is now weigh this against by the way jason sudeikis's statement which he gave about the incident which sounds totally stable he says quote the papers were drawn up to establish jurisdiction pardon this is actually his representative giving the quote quote papers were drawn up to establish jurisdiction relating to the children of ms wilde and mr sudeikis mr sedakis had no prior knowledge of the time or place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved that he would never condone her being served in such an inappropriate manner jason also went on to say the same thing in documents to the court uh he said essentially i was horrified to see that she was served in such a public manner and i deeply apologize for this he sounds like a normal person of course he had no idea that she was going to be served there but this created a very good reason for her to get out into the press and to purport herself to be a victim so that people would buy tickets to her movie which by the way everyone says kinda sucks but that wasn't enough because you can take down one man feminist you take down one man to get pressed but what if you take down two people initially uh before she cast harry styles as the lead in this movie don't worry darling she had cast shia labeouf so shia labeouf has notoriously struggled in the public sphere with alcoholism with drugs he's been to treatment centers olivia wilde knows all of this but the most notorious situation came about when fka twigs his former lover and girlfriend filed a lawsuit against him claiming that she was being abused now olivia wilde saw this as an opportunity and since the public didn't know why exactly shia labeouf was no longer in the film and her film was coming out she basically gave a statement to variety magazine which heavily implied that she dropped him because she was of course a feminist and she would never want to condone this sort of person being on her set she even talks about the ethos of her sets and he just did not go and go in line with the kind of ethos that she wanted to have on this set and so of course the public ate this up and believed this until shyla labeouf came out and he replied to this and he released a letter that he wrote to her in response to the interview that she gave to variety apparently what she is saying just wasn't true at all and he even released a video that she sent to him begging him to stay in the film first let's watch the video shaya shaya i just went riding my horse very sweaty but i wanted to reach out because i feel like i'm not ready to give up on this yet and i too am heartbroken and i want to figure this out and you know i think this might be a bit of a wake-up call for miss flo and i want to know if you're open to giving this a shot with me with us if she really commits if she really puts her her mind and heart into it at this point and if you guys can make peace and i respect your point of view i respect hers but if you guys can do it what do you think is there hope is there hope will you let me know okay bye i don't know kind of sounds like she's begging shia to be in the film and on top of that when she says miss flo she's referring to florence pew who was the other lead actress on this movie and she's sort of throwing her under the bus maybe maybe miss flow can get her stuff together this coming of course from feminist olivia begging to a guy to please stay on the film and that hopefully miss flo will get her stuff together and make this happen but more importantly i want to read i want to read shila labeouf's response to olivia in this letter that he wrote to her this email that he sent to her after seeing what she said in variety now again i as i mentioned child labof has struggled with addiction but he's clean now and he has been sober for a while now and he wrote her this email with a lot of clarity and i think it deserves more air time he wrote olivia i hope this finds you inspired purposeful fulfilled and well i pray every night that you and your family have health happiness and everything god would give me no joke every night before i go to sleep i have a little girl isabelle she is five months old and just beginning to develop the last half of her laugh it's amazing mia my wife and i have found each other again and are journeying toward a healthy family with love and mutual respect i have embarked on a journey that feels redemptive and righteous i write to you now with 627 days of sobriety and a moral compass that never existed before my great humbling that was the last year and a quarter of my life i reached out to you a few months ago to make amends and i still pray that one day you can find space in your heart to forgive me for the failed collaboration that we shared what inspired this email today is your latest variety story i'm greatly honored by your words on my work thank you that felt good to read i'm a little confused about the narrative that i was fired however you and i both know the reasons for my exit i quit your film because your actors and i couldn't find time to rehearse i have included as a reminder the screenshots of our text exchange on that day and my text to toby i know that you are beginning your press run for don't worry darling that the news of my firing is attractive click bait as i am still persona non grata and may remain as such for the rest of my life but speaking of my daughter i often think about the news article she will read when she is literate and though i owe and i will owe for the rest of my life i only owe for my actions my failings with twigs quick break to remind you twigs is the ex-girlfriend that filed the lawsuit against him my failings with twigs are fundamental and real but they are not the narrative that has been presented there is a time and a place to deal with such things and i am trying to navigate a nuanced situation with respect for her and the truth hence my silence but the situation with your film and my quote firing will never have a court date with which to deal with the facts if lies are repeated enough in the public they become truth and so it makes it that much harder for me to crawl out of the hole i have dug with my behaviors to be able to provide for my family firing me never took place olivia and while i fully understand the attractiveness of pushing that story because of the current social landscape the social currency that it brings it is not the truth so i'm humbly asking as a person with an eye toward making things right you correct the narrative as best you can i hope none of this negatively negatively affects you and that your film is successful in all the ways that you want it to be every blessing to you shia i mean wow what a it's a beautiful letter it's a beautiful leper letter from a man that is going through a redemptive process uh he had found god actually on the set of his last film um in which he plays a priest i believe don't quote me on that i'm not sure but he has turned to the catholic church and he is speaking about his faith journey so shia is a different man today than he was even three years ago and the idea that olivia would use his struggle to promote her film and also put out this lie that she dumped him because she's feminist af i mean i really think that illustrates her toxicity beyond this and this is notable the female lead actress florence pugh refuses to speak to olivia she refused it she refused to attend all of the press junkets pertaining to the film as it came out and on the actual day that it premiered which she was contractually obligated to go to the premiere she did not speak with the press she did not speak to olivia and she was sat a few chairs apart from her so that she never had to engage in her so apparently this feminist af person can't even have a productive and respectful relationship with the person that she has cast in her film doesn't exactly sound very feminist to me which then brings me to number four which is the problematic relationships that she has of course dragging her ex into the public sphere dragging shia labeouf into the public sphere in a negative way but also i just want to mention that olivia is about to be 40 she's 38 years old and she is now engaged in this relationship with harry styles who is a 28 year old man she has two children now i'm not saying that relationships can't work between a woman who is 38 years old and a man who is 28 year olds but um yeah no i am i am saying that they tend not to work so this is going to be interesting to see i do not think it's going to work out for her she to me seems to be a woman that is spiraling um and is being publicly insane she's olivia wilde is not a stable human being and she needs to be called out for this toxicity next cultural person who stays in the press but really really i must impress upon you guys that are watching all she wants is her privacy now i know you might think okay well that seems weird considering she keeps talking about the royal family publicly she now has a podcast where she is trashing them publicly and she did this glorious sit-down interview with oprah to trash the royal family publicly alongside her husband who should be ashamed of himself but she does at the end of the day meghan markle just wants her privacy and she really follows these same prototypes when we're talking about these women that are just clinically insane i mean meghan markle if you didn't know is a feminist she is a feminist in fact look at this photo of her wearing a feminist necklace she wants people to know that this is symbolic and that it represents planned parenthood and it represents women and she talks about how much she's a feminist all of the time but in case you want to know how long meghan markle has been a feminist i must point you to a video of her when she was just 11 years old and featured in a proctor and gamble commercial here she is meghan markle in her own words at the age of 11. when we first saw the commercial i knew something could be done because i was furious women are fighting greasy pots and pans and i said wait a minute how could somebody say that i think i'll write a letter the president of procter gamble procter gamble company cincinnati ohio dear sir last week at my school we decided to watch the news for social studies while through the channels we saw a commercial for the new ivory clear dishwashing liquid in the commercial they said women are battling grease meaning only women do dishes when i heard this the boys in my class started saying yeah that's where women belong in the kitchen just i think my favorite part of that is just when i saw this commercial i was furious you're 11 years old what are you talking about you saw a commercial and you were what 11 year old do you know even expresses an emotion as i was furious no that's maggie marco playing a part meghan markle beginning her early campaign to become eventually a d-less actress that went over to the uk to bag a prince bring him back so that she could be amongst the egg listers that she never really fit in with but i mean don't let me tell you too much about her because meghan markle will always tell you more about herself and how much of a feminist she is and in case you didn't get it and it wasn't clear to you i actually have a list of some quotes from meghan markle talking about how feminist she is she once said that's what gender equality means for me and having men be a part of that conversation saying that there's nothing threatening about a woman coming up to the same level also meghan markle you don't have to play dress up to be a feminist you are a feminist exactly the way you are by the way it doesn't really apply to olivia wilde who exclusively likes to dress up and play feminists in pretty skirts here's another quote from meghan markle women make up more than half of the world's population and potential so it is neither just nor practical for their voices for our voices to go unheard at the highest levels of decision making here's another megamarco quote i think the biggest part of being a girl boss in the office at home or anywhere you go is just knowing your value oh megan so pretty sprinkles and uh rainbows and all these good fluffy feelings and buzzwords that actually mean nothing that actually make women sound stupid this sounds like cartoon language feels good the value of a woman speaking up and men need to join us in our femininity and and we we love being women but we also can be men and we can also make a prince run around his tail in between his legs as i routinely of course speaking of toxic relationships attack his family meghan markle by the way is so feminist that she notoriously attacked kate middleton knowing fully well that kate middleton was not going to be able to respond of course the royal family protocol is that they don't engage in the press they cannot respond at the same level so she accused his entire family essentially of being a racist by refusing to say which family member made the racist comment but also said that kate middleton made her cry at her own wedding and knew that kate middleton would just have to suffer the press talking about her saying that this indeed happened and she was never going to be able to defend herself so how is that for feminists how's that for being a wonderful feminist who just wants to support other women essentially these women just say what they don't mean because at the end of the day they tend to be narcissists right meghan markle just wants to be an a-lister olivia wilde just wants to make her film popular she just wants to be in the press and get everybody talking about don't worry darling because she knows the product itself can't speak for itself because it sucks that's what the reviews by the way that's not my opinion that's actually the reviews that had come out since the venice film festival the film is just not that good and you actually shouldn't go see it but she's hoping that since she's dating the lead actor harry styles and she's intentionally going out and being seen with him at these fancy restaurants in new york and that photographers are surrounding her and they're interested in her relationship with a man by the way how's that feminism go find a man to make yourself relevant she's hoping by stirring up controversy and overly overly using the word feminism that people will just go see the film anyways even though you shouldn't spend one dollar on seeing this film megan similarly well i couldn't make it i didn't make it in my proctor and gamble commercial i guess that wasn't my big break i made the suits but nobody in america knew who i was so maybe if i again use a man how's that for feminism to make myself relevant and then i accuse everyone else of being a bad person then maybe i will be elevated to the level that i want to be elevated on in reality as i said these women are narcissistic they're problematic and they are women to avoid and not women that we should be putting onto a platform but this is the year of the crazy woman so let me tell you there are going to be more stories like this i talk about it all the time i am a proud non-feminist for just these reasons because i know that feminism is just a word that is being used there is literally no evidence that there is any equality issues between men and women women can do every single thing that men can do in fact in most circumstances women can do more than men can do because they are being given position simply because they're a woman nowadays right because that's the they want to aspire to equality by just saying you're a woman so stand here so we can check the box there's again nothing that is going on in our society in american society over in the uk that indicates that women are suffering because of the patriarchy this is a made-up nonsense that that women that are actually crazy love to purport so don't allow women to continue to tell you that there is some problem that they're facing because what's really happened is that the early wave of feminism might have actually been something of course women did not actually have the right to vote women did not actually have the right to go out into the workplace and to compete with men but all that has changed and it was really the third wave of feminism that allowed for this you know around the 1970s people started saying oh well now it's about sexual freedom and and we uh women want to not just be able to compete with men we want to be men there's been this strange push for women to not just be able to compete with men and be on the same level but they want to be men this goes back to the reason that harry looks so pathetic next to megan she you can clearly tell that she is wearing the pants in that relationship that what she says goes that harry really has no opinion he's completely irrelevant he's just kind of someone that she's plotted alongside her to get to where she wants to go and the results of this by the way of women acting like men is the reason that i think our society is falling apart because we have women that left the household who think that somehow now aspiring to be a stay-at-home mom is wrong and backwards instead we need to go make sure that we're chasing being directors of these movies and talking about how more women need to be like us right and not feeling more fulfilled inside of the household because we have these examples we've allowed the government to play mom i believe that women i think in their best role in my best role is me as a wife and me as a mother when people ask me that oh candace who is the best person that you've met you've met kanye you've met former presidents like really candace what is the coolest thing you've ever done the coolest part of every single one of my days is when i get to go home and i get to be with my children when i get to create moments with my family the coolest position that i get to hold is the ceo of my household of thinking about all of those things that are going to make my children better into the future i want to be the kind of mom that actually is engaged in the lessons that her children is learning are learning in school and because women have been made to feel ashamed of that women have been told somehow that aspiring to stay at home is bad and dirty and backwards and somehow provides the patriarchy with a wider platform it's the reason that we have children that are disappearing under leftist doctrines it's the reason that we're having these arguments today like about the trans agenda women look up and they go oh my gosh when did we lose control of our children when was it that i became no longer allowed to decide whether or not my child is going to wear a mask in school when did when did we get to a position where i can no longer decide whether or not i'm comfortable with my child having a vaccine well i'm telling you when it started it began in the 1970s with the creation of the department of education because feminists made this big push now women it's not enough to be on even keel you need to go be men and the government said ah what an opportunity for us to grow ourselves why don't we federalize the education department why don't we turn textbooks into mommy and daddy right because they're all they are out of the house so now there is this hole and we are going to rise up and fill it so when you're on tick tock and you're on instagram and you're wondering whose child is this right that seems to be my reaction when i watch crazy tick tock videos and i see little girls that look to be about 12 years old shaking their butts trying to get attention when i see 16 year olds and they're getting tummy tucks and they're getting their nose done and they're getting lip injections and mom is signing off on all of that and i think how did we get to this society where children don't even know what it means to be a child i say it's the empty homes it's because moms gave up what it meant to be a mother it's because we somehow felt that we needed to compete not just compete with men but to actually be men and by the way if you're wondering where that leads to if you if you chase or olivia wilde is chasing or what meghan markle is chasing it doesn't make you happy and it doesn't make you whole the most wholesome part of living happens inside

up a little bit nick cannon for whatever reason you guys know who nick cannon is for whatever reason this guy decided to say because he got multiple baby mamas and multiple kids that marriage between a man and a woman is eurocentric it's the white man's thing it's not that you because you black you can't be committed to a woman and get married you got to have you know kids by multiple women and be a deadbeat dad so i think that you know the ideas and the sentiment of people like nick cannon who are very successful i don't know if he's going down the path of nation of islam i don't know what his thing is but he's saying things that i think are destructive to men in america well let's watch the clip i think we should hear him in his own words it's not the number of kids though i guess people question the different baby mothers that's why why do people question that i mean because it like it's that's a eurocentric concept when you think about the ideas of like you're supposed to have this one person for the rest of your life and really that's just to classify property when you think about it i mean like when you go into that mindset if we really talk in that talk like just the idea that a man should have one woman we shouldn't have anything i have no ownership over this person like we really talking about how we coexist and how we populate it's about what exchange can we create together so i've never really subscribed to that mentality that's interesting because i'm pretty sure if it's nation of islam that he is supporting or he's advocating for if you want to talk about women being property literally when you have 10 wives and and they are all a piece of property owned by the man he might want to look into the other alternatives is all i'm saying has he ever heard of the taliban because they actually have a very similar view of marriage yeah but it's the purpose of this it's you don't even have to go that deep it's like quit trying to make the excuse for you to be you know if you're going to go out and sleep with all these women and you just want to have a good time and you don't want to have responsibility then then just say it yeah who's trying to make it educated yeah there's no educated way to say you're not successfully um interacting in your children's life there's no way in the world you can have five baby mamas and you are actively supporting all of those children that is the simple reason why there should be one man and one woman you could be in the same house taking care of your children and you don't have to put them at a disadvantage by not being there consistently i can't believe i have to defend nick cannon but i but i'll defend him in this way i mean he's trying to make it a white thing and he's saying it's eurocentric it is eurocentric in the sense that it's christian it's a christian idea that a one man and one woman leave their families cling together and what god is united let no man separate there are plenty of other countries all around the world that you can have 10 wives 20 wives out of wedlock and nick cannon has has been showing his cards i think in recent months he he went on tv some months ago and started repeating the kooky theories of a radical black nationalist professor from the 70s name's leonard jeffries and he said that black people are the people of the sun and white people or the ice people and that's why nick cannon actually said white people don't have souls they're closer to animals and so he's really going down the line of these radical ideas that are attacks it's not even that it's only attacks on white people it's a tax on western civilization and the really scary thing for us when we look at our enemies abroad is that there are a lot of attacks on our civilization coming from within our own culture and our society and our country and that maybe that's something that we've got to focus a little bit more on before we go spread that's exactly right i mean america is imploding i really believe this america right now is imploding there we don't we don't even need a a bullet fired we don't need anybody to arrive troops coming from china nothing we're imploding there is this cultural marxist perspective we don't have a culture right now in america we don't have a culture we just have uh a bunch of people that want to destroy any any sign of culture right any sign of culture yeah we have an anti-culture that's exactly right so that looks like that's a culture we're going to destroy it that looks like that could be good we're going to destroy it and that it's radical it's just radical and at the same time we have the majority and i believe that conservatives are the majority in this country who are too scared to say anything right so it's it's every week i feel like i'm preaching to conservatives to stand up and to say things every week i feel like pull your kids out of school do something about it but i don't know and i hope i'm wrong i mean do we have that spirit do we actually have that american fighting spirit that it's going to take to save the country i know a lot of women can relate but i do not know anything about cars i simply want mine to

sent you we have to start standing up if we don't we're going to lose it all but if we do we'll gain everything and we have to have faith in god you know a lot of people that are conservative or christians or whether they're jewish christians or whatever you have a faith in god and we need to rely on god and say look we take that stand and god have your back if you need to quit your job to take a stand then you do that if that's right for your family you do that and you trust that god to open up an opportunity but we cannot be afraid i mean nobody in the bible was afraid david and goliath he wasn't afraid he went the battle he won the battle if he never started the battle then we would we would never know if he would have been a win i wish people would realize i wish i always say people if you're afraid fine but you should have a bigger fear right so if you when you get behind the bigger fear it's like well i'm afraid to say anything because i just want my kid to be able to go to this school i'm afraid to say anything because i don't want to lose my job guys if if this turns into a communist country you're not going to have a job like you know the other side is you're going to be fleeing like these people are fleeing so you're going to be trying to flee this country if you don't have a country none of this matters and that's the problem is that they're harnessing the immediate fear and not what the bigger fear should be which is that if america falls you are going to be like people in venezuela we are going to be like the people in cuba this is going to be a a prison this is going to be a prison you're not going to make any money you're going to be impoverished like how does that not make you want to do something or say something there are more important things in life believe it or not than getting that next promotion or getting a couple bucks this was the the biggest mistake probably from the state department from the obama administration from the biden administration was this line that obama said he said well you know i'm only slightly paraphrasing well you know the reason that people are fighting in afghanistan is they just don't have enough jobs enough iphones they don't have enough panera bread or whatever you know and that's not it actually i mean the taliban i don't want to say anything nice about the taliban but the the one thing you can say about them they believe in something they believe in their vision of god they believe in their vision of religion and what do we believe in we used to have a vision of god we used to but now now we believe in iphones and fast food and making a little bit more money and that is not enough to sustain a civilization getting back to brandon's point you've got to have some religious view of the world or nothing really means anything i mean they want your kid to be fat sloppy and it's a real word it's a real word no that word always bothers me like it's actually that's the word i want to say yeah yeah like delayed it's an actual word to something is actually a word well then they make it derogatory they make it derogatory and suddenly it's like a word you can't say and i'm like this is a real english word i don't want to be i like that that sounds like the title of a really bad memoir you know like fat sloppy but but it's true everybody that's watching this know i'm telling the truth you know they want your kids to be you know not leaders don't know how to pursue excellence not being entrepreneurs they want to just sign up to work their way you know to death that's all they want to do government slaves government slaves and we don't we don't need that anymore we need to teach more entrepreneurs that's what this country is made on i mean people came from nothing to create things they don't sit around and just hope somebody give them an opportunity that's not that's not the way it works and going through a system this leads to this lease to this lease to this you know you go to high school do you have to go to college that's not true you don't have to go to college if that's not what's best for you that's not what your dreams are then don't do that i'm questioning whether kids even go to kindergarten with the way that these classes these classrooms are going right now you know the one line you've heard this from both parties this this line they'll say the the worst part about kovid is that's kept the kids out of the schools that's like the only good thing about it the greatest part about government yeah they've kept the kids out of school 100 thanks for

you it's real when I was shown it I thought it was a joke I thought it was a Saturday Night Live unfunny spoof maybe I thought maybe it was a Babylon B headline it's not rep Eric swalwell of California you know him he sucks he released a campaign video that forecasts the future for families in states where abortion is outlawed so this is supposed to be a futuristic video this is what's going to happen if we Outlaw abortion the video for the former prosecutor is entitled Locker up and it opens with a family that is sitting around a dinner table when suddenly two police officers knock on the door and announce that they are going to be arresting the mother for unlawfully terminating a pregnancy take a listen [Music] it's weird [\u00a0__\u00a0] cute gross down Larry Anderson yes I have a warrant for your arrest a rest for what penal code 243 violation unlawful termination of a pregnancy you've got to be kidding me that that is my personal business that's for the courts to decide ma'am your medical records have been subpoenaed and Dr Landry's already in custody no my God you you can't just you will have to submit to a physical examination put your hands behind your back now why is this happening love you honeybear we're just enforcing the law here elections have consequences vote Democrat on November 8th stop Republicans from criminalizing abortion everywhere protect women's rights and freedom please don't do this [Laughter] they are correct elections of consequences in California you elected an idiot his name is Eric swalwell and he actually thought this was a good video This is actually premiering I mean could you imagine watching this on TV and not and actually thinking that it's a joke and it's real I keep thinking this is gonna rally the troops behind him oh my God it's so true if I don't vote for Eric swalwell then obviously the police are going to be knocking on my door and they're gonna pull out their guns while there's a baby sitting in a high chair I mean it's just it's just stupid I mean this is it this is all they've got it's just this never-ending fear campaign that should try to push in force through their policies I mean first and foremost the great irony by the way is that there is no state that gives your gift gives parents less control over their children than California right if you're going to talk about the dystopian nightmare that is California I remember when I was doing my series um a shot in the dark which I released on parlor talking about why I chose not to vaccinate my children neither of my children are vaccinated I'm very proud and open about that I don't mind if you do something different but this is how I live my life and I I remember all of the moms who were writing to me from California were saying okay but we literally don't have the option to choose that in California California will send around the DCS if you do not get the vaccines as mandated by the state so so you don't even have parents in that state if you're going to have people knocking on the door it's probably going to be the government because you're making decisions about the health of your children it's not going to be the government because you got an abortion and they're gonna whip uh pistols out on you and tell you that you're under arrest while you're eating dinner with your family again this is all just fear-mongering and it's all the left has it's all they have left it's how they are able to assert control if there's any person that is watching that going yeah that's why why I have to vote um then you represent a very real argument of why there should be a basic IQ test before you're allowed to vote up next because Democrats don't even realize what they're saying half the time this is also hilarious Stacy Abrams joined Morning Joe on MSNBC and she said that more abortions could help solve the inflation problem I wish I was kidding I'm not take a listen having children is why you're worried about your price for gas it's why you're concerned about how much food costs for women this is not a reductive issue you can't divorce being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy from the economic realities of having a child to say guys I know you're concerned about the gas prices I know you're a little concerned about what's happening at the grocery store and that you're spending a hundred dollars for a little slice of steak but have you ever thought that it's actually your fault because you had children actually the problem is that you're alive the problem is that you're breathing it's not that the government totally messed up and their policies have been anti-nationalistic right basically telling us that we should be dependent upon other nations and that Joe Biden should be on his hands and knees begging OPEC to turn on the lights or that Europe should be on their hands and knees begging Russia to turn on the lights no that's the problem the problem is not your government being stupid the problem is that you're breathing genius why didn't I think of it why didn't I think of it oh I know because I'm not a Democrat and I just could not imagine having the audacity to look people in the faces that are suffering that are truly suffering because my goodness look at the price of gas my goodness when I go to the grocery store in fact my makeup artist said this morning I just got stuff to make tacos literally just to make tacos I didn't even get the Shell at at the grocery store and it cost her ninety dollars ninety dollars for taco night doesn't even make sense but forget the fact that these people are actually suffering that all of us are realizing that there is this much inflation and forget actually saying I'm sorry we messed up we messed up we should have had better policies and you know what we're going to do we are going to stop boycotting against the pipelines right we are we are a nation that could be energy independent and we're going to take every step to make that happen rather than doing that they are draining our oil reserves and getting their politicians on stage to tell you stop breathing essentially just stop breathing stop creating so many people that breathe you know it's basically like saying stop being poor that's it that's the message from a Democrat Party up next guys and speaking of things that are hilarious there was a girl on tick tock she says that she went to high school with me and she dropped a video uh basically calling me a fraud and a hurt fraud though because of what I lived through in High School Miss again is a reaction there's been tons of tick tock videos that are being made by individuals because of my George Floyd documentary it's very problematic to tell the truth and so now the media is platforming anyone and anything that is against Candace Owens let's take a listen to what she had to say I don't want to be a part of this culture um you can stick around if you want you can go watch the original video for context I got something to say to Candace she's probably never gonna see this but I just want to see my piece I see it hey Candace hey girl you remember High School I remember High School it was it was quite a while ago it was like 15 years ago you remember 2007 I remember 2007 yeah um I remember some very horrible things happen to you in 2007 and some very racist white children called you including the mayor's son and said some very racist things to you and threatened your life that should have never happened to you that was terrible um I remember you sued the school board for that I remember because everybody was talking about it my family was talking about it my grandma was calling up your grandma uh the entire school school system was talking about it it was a huge deal because the mayor's son was involved and you had the NAACP backing you up when that happened and they got you your settlement I think I I think you should have gotten more because I am always ready to let racists Pockets bleed but regardless NAACP backs you up the black community backed you up wow this is a compelling story it's it's a compelling story that in high school I received some racist messages from some powerful Democrats Sons um it's compelling and the NAACP helped me get a settlement and you know what I I have no idea who this person is I made a tick tock video but I have to be honest I do remember this story in fact I remember it so well so well that is chapter two of my book I've had this girl of course journalists never fact check whether or not to school with me nobody cares right it's somebody that is on Tick Tock where we all go to get our information now right saying that she went to school with me that her grandma called me well I'll be able to fact check that because my grandmother's been dead since 2013. but this girl remembers this I have no idea this human being is I messaged four people when I went to high school up and said is anybody recognize this girl from the class of 2007 in Stanford high and everyone came back and said no okay I can tell you definitively she never was in a class with me in 2007 in Stanford high school at the very least was not in a class with me all throughout school and yet she makes me doing Tick Tock and it gets millions of views and people go oh my gosh she brought up the NAACP the NAACP was involved oh what I can confirm is that this girl read my book yeah you're right the NAACP was involved they never spoke to me but they showed up at my school with cameras because they wanted to fundraise off of a girl that has suffered through something that was is very real it's actually the reason that I am conservative it's the reason why I stand up against these race Hustlers like the NAACP because for me it's real they used me they lied and they never checked up with me it was all about getting headlines and so you are not breaking any stories but I am glad that unlike the people that shared this video you actually read again chapter 2 of my book blackout it's been on sale for the last two years I suggest everybody else go read it and get up on that story ladies and gentlemen that is all that I have to say today all right you know the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you're not yet a member go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now [Music] thank you", "2DvZupArvtI": "okay question of the day does anybody else remember their dare programs that they went through a middle school dare stood for drug abuse resistance education well I would be imparting some of that education upon my listeners today plus we'll be discussing Planned Parenthood they are now giving out free vasectomies in a mobile van that is being nicknamed The Nutcracker yeah that is real all that and more today on Candace Owens [Music] okay this is quite a severe topic and I'm just going to impart the stories upon you because I have been shocked and I feel traumatized by the events that are taking place very close to my hometown and all throughout America the first victim her name was Julia garamani and she had just graduated law school in 2022. Julia during the pandemic was staying with her family out in Greenwich Connecticut and she went back to the city because she wanted to pack some things before she headed out on a trip she texted a number that belonged to a drug answering service and she asked if they could send somebody they did send somebody they sent somebody right away actually it took that individual just nine minutes to get to her Julia was found dead the next morning the cocaine that she thought that she was ordering was in fact laced with fentanyl just a little bit of fentanyl is what it takes to kill any individual the second victim was Amanda sure Amanda sure was 36 years old and she was also at her apartment alone in New York City she called the same drug delivery service the drugs arrived a couple of hours later and she tried them she texted the dealer and said that that batch was better than the last batch she then jumped on for a private patient online consultation from 8 o'clock P.M to 9 o'clock P.M sat down on the sofa turned on the television and was not heard from again you can guess exactly where that story ended the third victim I think is the most traumatizing because he was about to become a father for the first time his name was Ross Matangi he was 40 years old and he left his pregnant partner to go stay in a hotel to get some work done he was a Harvard graduate traded derivatives at JP Morgan and Bank of America before he got a job at Credit Suisse he had his entire life ahead of him very successful he actually got onto a conference call with his boss simultaneously or around the same time he was texting a dealer asking him to deliver the goods he had another call just an hour later with that same boss and he never made the call his boss never heard from him again he texted his sister actually and said hey I haven't heard from your brother obviously his wife was worried about him and similarly reached out to the sister and his sister found him the next morning in the hotel dead of an overdose all three victims across town had partaken in the exact same batch of what they thought was cocaine but in fact was laced with fentanyl the story to me is traumatizing the story comes from the Wall Street Journal who did a very good job presenting this in a profile piece as they spoke with the victims families and are bringing this most important issue to the Forefront but the story to me is important because this happened just a couple of years ago in my hometown very close to the city three individuals that I went to school with and that I knew very well that were in the same friend groups as me one of them who was one of the kindest people that I had ever met were not working because of the pandemic had a lot of time perhaps were feeling depressed and did the same thing they thought they were partying with cocaine they all did lines of what they thought to be cocaine and it turned out that it was laced with fentanyl all three individuals from Stanford Connecticut dropped down dead the other day my cousin explained to me that another three victims in Stamford Connecticut have dropped dead because of what they perceived to be cocaine being laced with fentanyl again one of the victims the other two names are pending I went to University with I know him he is in the same friend groups as me he is just 33 years old this is happening over and over and over again all across the nation in fact in case you're not aware we are now at a critical point 300 people 300 people per A Day in the United States are dying from accidental fentanyl overdoses we know this is happening because of the opioid crisis people are that are actually pursuing fentanyl are addicted to it are looking for a high because perhaps they were given some drugs when they got a tooth pulled and they were turned into addicts searching for something that could sustain those highs I don't know how to communicate this message more effectively than to Simply say that we now live in a society where your children and you cannot experiment with drugs totally different growing up during my time nobody was fearful that the stuff that they were consuming was going to be laced with fentanyl right I understand that children want to experiment it's a part of them trying to to pursue their freedom you drink before you're allowed to I certainly did I didn't wait until I was 21 years old you have kids that go to college and they do drugs for a little bit before they get their lives together when they're adults it no longer is one of those things where you have to be addicted to the drug you can just be experimenting for your first time as many people are and you can drop dead and have your entire life taken away from you this message has to be communicated effectively to all teenagers right now you have to make them aware that this is one of the scariest things one of the scariest crises that I've ever seen in my life taking place in America we talk about people that are dying of covid and we have a ticker every single day across the mainstream media trying to make us fearful that if you get covered you will die what happens we all react people are locking themselves at home people are wearing masks there are people today that even though they are not required to wear masks still choose to do it because they are that traumatized by the numbers that were on their screens why isn't the media trying to communicate the same dangers when it comes to Fentanyl why aren't we seeing people recognizing how fearful they should be over this very real and not imagined crisis that woman the partner of Ross Matangi gave birth just three short weeks after her partner was found dead in a hotel room and my heart breaks for her you can't even imagine what she went through having to experience the juxtaposition of emotions at first being so elated that her son was brought into the world a healthy baby boy but then realizing the tremendous sadness that her son will never know his father because of a quick decision that took place in a hotel room her entire life is forever changed her son's life is now forever changed as I said this is happening all across America and it seems that the mainstream media is not impressing enough how serious of a crisis that we are facing so let me give you guys some statistics you can tether yourself to that reality the latest Customs and Border Protection data shows that from the beginning of this year to August 12 900 pounds of fentanyl has been seized that is more than for the entire of 2021 in which 11 200 pounds were confiscated and shows that three times more fentanyl was seized in the first eight months of this year and in the entire year for 2020 and more than four times the total for 2019. drug use obviously increased throughout the pandemic with deaths hitting an annual high of one hundred and seven thousand five hundred and twenty one people in 2021 which is up 51 since 2019. nearly three quarters of those deaths have involved fentanyl fentanyl in case you don't remember is 50 times stronger than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine again this is very real this is not imagined this is no longer the time in America where you could simply experiment with drugs and get away with it experiment from drugs and hide it from your parents imagine what all of these parents are going through realizing that their children are dying how embarrassing it is to go through that when people realize that they were doing drugs and they dropped dead we have to start having these real conversations in our household because we know the mainstream media is not going to have it for us and that's all I have to say about that okay guys so with midterms coming up there's something you should keep in mind every dollar you spend is a vote and you're casting those votes over and over again for companies who are working hard to undermine your values for example Verizon Wireless customers you're supporting a company that canceled one America news for their support of President Trump ATT customers your wireless provider doesn't just support far left CNN they own it T-Mobile customers your CEO openly advised Democrats on how to beat Trump in the 2020 election don't give your money to woke wireless companies give it to pure talk instead pure talk not only believes in conservative American Family Values but they also give you the best service at a low cost unlimited talk text and plenty of data for just thirty dollars a month the average family saves almost one thousand dollars per year that's a thousand less votes for the those cell phone companies that want to stop you from speaking freely switching to peer talk only takes 10 minutes it's a no-brainer now is your chance to show Corporate America you're done funding their leftist ideologies go to puretalk.com and enter code Owens to save 50 off your first month that's puretalk.com promo code Owens 50 off your first month okay now it's time for some topics to journal thank you all right guys before we get into this I just want to make it clear I am still in London and we are dealing with a lot of helicopters and a lot of sirens and a lot of noise because I guess the UK has its eighth prime minister for the week and that's being announced today so there's a lot of media action happening behind me but the first word that I want to jump into to stay with this theme of making sure parents are aware of what is going on in this new modern industry of drugs uh there was a recent Boston because Halloween is just around the corner you should be aware of this they were able to find fentanyl pills that were in various colors that were destined for distribution throughout New York City and they were being concealed in a Lego box to deter law enforcement attention defense no pills were also imprinted with M and 30 to resemble 30m oxycodone hydroxychloride and 30 milligram pills also more relevant because Halloween is around the corner on September 27th in Connecticut officials seized 15 thousand pills that were disguised as Skittles and nerds in Connecticut the DEA says that 40 percent of the Pills contain a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl to be honest I just don't think it's worth it right now if you have a child and they're going trick-or-treating doesn't matter how safe your neighborhood is get the candy let them enjoy the experience of going door to door but just don't give any of them to it we're in some strange times in this country and there are more things that we have to worry about it's very simple to allow them to enjoy the experience of trick-or-treating and then when you get back home just throw all the candy out and give them some that you purchase and that you trust again this is really sad this is not the spirits that people have going into the holidays but we do have to continue to tether ourselves to the circumstances and the reality of what is going on outside and it is just no longer in America at the very least and also in some other places it's no longer a safe country for children I feel that way in my soul I feel that way even in sending them to school that it's not something that we can just do and Trust the system is going to take care of them and now unfortunately we have to worry about people that are trying to get drugs and successfully not just trying that are successfully getting drugs over the border and are realizing or hoping that they will not be detected if they're able to get it into children's candy it would be a very simple mistake for a child to pick that up a very simple mistake for an adult to believe that they are purchasing that candy and that it truly is candy and so we should all be on high alert as we go into the holiday season Switching gears because you need to see this if you have not seen this uh Senator Ted Cruz from Texas went on The View and it was glorious everything that you expect when you have somebody that is tremendously smart sitting next to these ladies who just have talking points and it's always uh we hate the Republican Party the Republican party is awful they're actually still trying to keep up the theater that the indirect action was the worst thing that ever happened in America a couple of grandmas walking through the Capitol building and yet the media pretended actually said I didn't pretend actually said that this was similar to 9 11. or thousands and thousands of Americans were killed where planes were hijacked where entire buildings went down they were trying to correlate that to your grandma walking around the Capitol Building storming the Capitol Building as they called it as if the Capitol building is not being paid for by the very same people that quote unquote storm did uh here is Ted Cruz if you missed his appearance take a listen try to say the election was fair and square and legitimate you know who y'all don't do that to you don't do it to Hillary Clinton who stood up and said Trump stole the elections who said who said that the election was stolen they sat here yes and said it was illegitimate and you guys were fine with it okay so it's illegitimately Republicans no you know here's the thing we may not like when Republicans win but we don't go and we don't storm we don't try to change did I miss an entire year Tifa riots were cities across this country your position is the left doesn't engage in violence really no they wanted to know I'm our friend Mike Pence you just accused us of doing something we didn't do you said Hillary Clinton didn't say whatever she didn't say I'm saying to you listen and she said we stay here and you were fine with her saying it was illegitimate yes she called Donald Trump the next morning and she conceded the election Ted okay [Applause] Trump is an illegitimate president Hillary Clinton says the election is stolen from you Hillary Clinton in 2002 George W Bush was selected Not Elected Joe Biden Al Gore was was elected president so Joe Biden yeah so Whoopi Goldberg doesn't know what antifa is she doesn't know that's the best things I have no idea what you're talking about who or what is antifa are you we have no idea who they are because they Riot on our behalf they've been rioting not just in America but all across the world there are these little anti-fascists that are in fact the fascists we know that they are a very organized cell of individuals and for whatever reason the FBI just cannot infiltrate this cell of antifa people but I'll tell you what annoys me the most about January 6th is that they always pretend that the issue was that they were not allowed to be in the Capitol building right that they stormed the Capitol building my family person that remembers Brett Kavanaugh can we pour some out for my homie Brett Kavanaugh does anybody remember his confirmation process when all of these individuals were storming into the building trying to stop his confirmation in fact and we will show it to you right now do you not remember when vice president Pence was trying to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and a woman began shrieking yeah take a listen to this flashback awesome [Music] the sergeant-at-arms will restore order in the gallery [Applause] [Music] the sergeant-at-arms will restore order in the gallery [Applause] [Music] so you're going to have to forgive me that I don't really buy Alyssa Farah and these other hosts on The View pretend to be so upset because they were worried about vice president Pence when all of these people were completely silent when vice president had a shrieking woman that had stormed the chambers and was trying to prevent Brett Kavanaugh from becoming confirmed that the Supreme Court Justice because he had some beers in high school and by the way he still likes beers we all still like beers so how about that moving on guys Planned Parenthood is also moving on they've realized that there may be some issues now that women actually get the right to vote on whether or not they want abortion yeah far from the depiction of the mainstream media saying that women's rights were taken away nope women's register taken away when we never got the right to vote on whether or not we wanted abortion and now the Supreme Court said this is ridiculous we're sending it back down to the stage so that we can make our own decision about that imagine that imagine women actually having a say on their own bodies and yet the media telling you it's the opposite well Planned Parenthood is not like this at all of course this is what they do this is what they were built upon they were built upon the concept of eugenics getting people that they perceived that Margaret Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood perceived to be too stupid to have Offspring to agree to abort their offspring that was it that was the entire plan for Planned Parenthood so to speak and she was in my opinion one of the most successful progressives of her day obviously because there are women that are now arguing for that right to abort their own offspring not realizing that this was Machiavellian by Design well Planned Parenthood doesn't like that we are being allowed to vote state by stage they're thinking how can we abort more children and they've realized the way to do it is to Target men and to Target men with vans that are actually being called nut crackers and telling men to step inside of these Vans and agree to get vasectomies so Planned Parenthood and a physician with a mobile vasectomy clinic in case you were looking for one of those are going to offer 60 free vasectomies over three days in St Louis Springfield and Joplin Missouri in the first week of November the doctor's name is escar gorin and he wants to take his mobile clinic a vehicle that his friends are dubbing The Nutcracker on the road the following week so if you are looking for a good road show to go to step inside this one because there's going to be free vasectomies for everyone he also plans to offer discounted vasectomies at his regular clinic in the Des Moines area so if that's what you want to do this weekend you can totally get behind that I find it to be interesting I don't think it's gonna have the same appeal this is a weird thing to say but for whatever reason I feel it's easier to convince women to ruin their bodies whether or not we're talking about mutilation or you're talking about getting abortions or you're talking about you know women that are now doing the iuds for birth control for whatever reason women don't really think about their Anatomy as much and they sort of just blanketly trust the science I have realized this when I speak to women about like I said the forms of birth control that they're using I think it's going to be a little bit harder of a self for men I really do believe that men probably think about their parts a little more they feel a little bit more present to them there is actually something that is that I was told is true I don't know if I'm passing this on as hearsay but doctors say that if something happens to a woman and they lose Consciousness and they wake up in the hospital and don't know where they are a woman's first instinct when they are are woken up is to say is everybody okay how are my friends like how are my family uh and a man's first instinct when they wake up after out of coming out of coma is to open the blankets and to make sure they still have their parts I was told that is true I don't know if I'm repeating this anecdotally but it sounds about right and so I do not think that this is going to be a very easy sell for Planned Parenthood but I could be proven wrong I could be proven wrong we know that we have some men that are going through and just getting their entire penises removed because I think that they're women but I call that mental disorder next story and this one is really strange so if you're listening to this podcast please go look for this on YouTube I'm going to show the video and talk you through it but it is worth you actually taking a pause and looking at it yourself I am trying to justify what Katy Perry did on stage I am trying to assign some reason to what my eyes are telling me is very strange and bizarre but she essentially malfunctioned I only describe it is she looks like a robot and suddenly somebody pulled her batteries out or pulls her plug out and it almost sort of looks like she's at the beginning of having a stroke one of her eyes begins to just close by itself and she starts like hitting the side of her head trying to get the eye to open does that sound like I'm talking about a horror film well it actually looked like a horror film and I want you guys to take a look at it and listen at it right now [Applause] make even more noise so what we're seeing is her performing on stage her right eye just closes entirely while her left eye is still blinking she then takes her hand and just sort of begins hitting her Temple almost like she's trying to get the eye to reopen she does it about three times it honestly it looks to me like she's at the beginning of having a stroke and then she's able to sort of force her right eye open and she keeps you know she stands up straight and takes her microphone she looks very confused by what she just experienced and she walks off I mean what was that obviously the first thing that came to my mind was the fact that we are seeing so many young artists who supported getting the Pfizer vaccine that are now going through face paralysis and things of that nature Justin Bieber probably most notoriously who came out and said he had to suspend his tour because he was suffering from face paralysis and there by every indication this is a young healthy married young man his wife similarly went through a blood clot and talked about how she was just having breakfast one morning and then suddenly Her speech was starting to slur and she realized that something was going wrong the media is trying to make it seem like all of this is normal and we are all just crazy conspiracy theorists for thinking that the vaccines which were essentially forced upon these individuals in order to go back to work that included celebrities in order to go back on tour in order to be able to have a room full of people screaming your name dancing to your music you had to agree to roll up your sleeve and get vaccinated now there is no guess you don't have to guess whether or not Katy Perry got the vaccine in fact her and Orlando Bloom decided to go as a vaccine for Halloween here is an actual photo of them Orlando Bloom posted it on Instagram and the caption is I vaxxed a girl and I liked it Digi Orlando he is dressed as a doctor he is of course wearing a mask wear a mask save lives Orlando Bloom she is the vaccine and she is also wearing a mask wear a mask save lives but maybe also if you get this vaccine there could be some side effects like myocarditis like thrombosis like blood clots um and maybe your right eye May malfunction in the middle of a concert again I am positing this I have no proof I cannot say that is for sure what happened I tried to rationalize my eyes I tried to say well maybe her eyelash got caught in there but I honestly that is being very generous to give for that excuse that it would have did there just couldn't have been eyelash in there it had been a golf ball in there and I still wouldn't have reacted like that so again if you're listening to this podcast and you are not watching it go check out the video by yourself look for it online you can find me on YouTube covering this topic now it's time for the comment Roundup you know I love reading your thoughts about my commentary even when you guys are really mean and call me names and call me ugly just kidding nobody's ever called me ugly even if they hate me a few girls have but anyways here's what is in the comment Roundup for today this person was responding in response to yesterday's episode where we talked about America kind of becoming this ugly place which is not really inspiring how did we bring back Beauty this commentary's name is Ariel the mermaid oh Ariel the mermaid I get it and she says thank you for addressing this regarding American cities I think it's convenience using what is available the quickest for people and the last lack of unity in our culture we will never agree about instituting a beauty standard when it comes to our architecture if we cannot agree agree upon basic moral ones Toby Anderson also commented and said Candace you hit the nail on the head as an Australian who's visited America a couple of times America has great places to visit and its museums are amazing but I think it's celebrity and social media which dictates the culture now Australia is following suit to America it's sad to see this cultural depletion across the world that is a very interesting perspective and I think a wise one it is true that Hollywood when people think of Hollywood you're only talking about America we are the people that have made Hollywood a thing right every single person in the world that is that is the most followed comes from America they live in Los Angeles they have a house in Los Angeles and I do think that they are setting the standards of beauty when we talk about the Kardashians like we did yesterday when we talk about cardi B when we talk about you know the depreciation of music and the depreciation of beauty and it is true that these people are given tremendous platforms that are influencing young minds and in my opinion perverting them perverting their aspirations and not giving them something to properly aspire to in terms of our in terms of our culture we don't promote in Hollywood ballet dancers we don't uh promote classical composers we have them they're just not considered interesting enough to Garner a lodge following on Instagram but I follow them I think it's great so I appreciate that comment uh this person is responding to my comments on the protester that called Matt Walsh a Nazi if you remember I said that the Nazis were the ones that were involved in experimentation xeno's breed says Candace this logic is like saying that we can't or should not have given any medication or treatments for anything to children on the grounds of it being experimental don't really understand that comment uh then when I'm talking about Nazi experimentation I'm talking about the fact that they took people against their wills and experimented on their bodies I'm talking about Dr Joseph magelli who was considered the angel of death so you might want to look into him I would not correlate that the same to the same as uh giving your children Tylenol I don't think that's what we're really talking about here and of course reasonably you expect that there needs to be clinical trials when you're talking about giving individuals Medicine of course there are children that have cancer that is not what he was doing as a Nazi that's not what the Nazis were interested in in fact they were interested also in biological warfare and so I would say look that up a little further next up we have people that are responding to my comments on Beyonce and Taylor Swift's album being objectively bad Devil Wears Maga God that's really good Devil Wears Maga says how are they objectively bad Candice I'd rather be run through a meat grinder than listen to a song by either but that is not objective that is my opinion sure it comes from a position of excellent taste in music but it's still subjective no my excellent Taste of music is not subjective actually I am the science and uh therefore I have deemed that Taylor Swift's new album is trash as is Beyonce's Renaissance one and I can't explain or share with you how I have come to that science but I can tell you that my opinion is objective next comment is an individual responding to Dylan Mulvaney who keeps playing dress up as a woman and his ability to somehow be allowed to interview Joe Biden Brody says I'm gay but at some point it's attention-seeking Behavior becomes too much I have female friends who do not act the way this person does I also think it is important to realize that not everyone in the gay community Etc acts this way I don't agree with portraying all women as weak dainty little flowers exactly my point I couldn't agree more with two things that you're saying first and foremost the trans agenda is a caricature of what it means to be a woman I don't know any woman that talks like that like oh my God yeah yeah good flowers like maybe they're in some Valley in California they actually speak like that but in reality this is the trans woman culture where they're playing dress-up like Halloween as women and they are leaning into stereotypes of really the movie Clueless I would say is probably where they're getting those stereotypes from it's a movie that they saw and they go okay I'm gonna be share and I'm going to shriek about an Elijah dress and I'm gonna be like oh goodbye I'm So at the mall maybe Mean Girls is another one where they're kind of leaning into that which means girls was meant to be hyperbole but yes it's very insulting to women to say that that's all that we are is a skirt lipstick and a really over hyper feminine attitude and beyond that I very much agree with you sort of separating yourself as a gay individual and saying that this is attention seeking behavior and for whatever reason as I mentioned yesterday gay men are being told that they have to defend this they're just like oh we made a banner and we put all these letters in it and you're one of these letters so now you have to offend you have to defend this attention seeking Behavior which by the way is what Tick Tock is Tick Tock and social media app most social media apps or attention seeking Behavior but Tick Tock really harnesses the power of narcissism to create Trends it really is all about people creating these little moments uh as this individual did of oh look I'm a girl being super ridiculous being super overdone so people go oh my gosh what is that and they click it for views so I think that that is really well said all right

lot of hot takes um also i just think that the propaganda has been off the chain but first i just want to get into plausibly the worst takes in western media and that we have to start with annalynne mccord very beautiful girl also an actress keep that in mind let's watch her way to deal with this conflict by writing a poem to vladimir putin and pop posting it on the internet dear president vladimir putin i'm so sorry that i was not your mother if i was your mother you would have been so loved held in the arms of joyous light never would the stories plight the world unfurled before our eyes a pure demise of nations sitting peaceful under a night sky if i was your mother the world would have been warm so much laughter and joy and nothing would harm i can't imagine the stain the soul-stealing pain that the little boy you must have seen and believed and the formulation of thought quickly taught that you lived in a cruel unjust world is this why you now decide no one will get the best of you is this why you do not hide nor away shy from taking back the world it was it because so early in life all that strife wrapped your little body with fear if i was i can't i can't take anymore just stop it please honestly i tried just stop it right there that's enough um honestly she sounds more eloquent than president biden and kamala true i would i'm gonna glass half full that what do you guys think of her beautiful poem what do you actually what do you think putin is thinking if he sees this on the internet oh he's due to surrender any moment now i mean like if that doesn't do it that i don't know what else we can do frankly we've thrown our best poets at him yeah i can't believe he actually may have seen that and decided to still continue with attacks on ukraine like i don't know how she didn't change his mind it must have just been a language issue i can't think of it are we not the most in like it's just like everyone's stepping up the plate to embarrass us more you know what i mean it's like it's not enough that we have our our leaders just you know every day that president biden tries to compose a sentence it's embarrassing but now we have the actors and the actresses writing poems if i was your mother like this i would find to be weird if i was a three-year-old it was actually my mother right like why are you writing poetry to me mom this is weird yeah i think it's i think it's weird that she was actually serious yeah you know i thought this was satire but i i really do think that she honestly took the time to write that in in hopes that it would convince anybody to do anything positive but i think it's very weird and these people are out of touch with reality yeah this is this is what hollywood is i mean they're just they act all the time and this looks to me like one of those drama classes like when you go to drama school and you're on stage and you're sitting in one chair and like the lights are low and you and then your teacher tells you marvelous utterly marvelous um but this was embarrassing [Laughter] not actually the worst take though oh no no so actually i love this next one i'm not gonna lie um she is me secretly joy behar i never thought sister that i would feel you more in a moment but this is what she had to say about the russian ukrainian conflict we're talking about five million people that that are going to be displaced yeah i mean it's it's heartbreaking to hear what is going to happen yeah well i'm scared of what's going to happen in in western europe too yeah you know you just you plan a trip you want to go there i want to go to italy for four years i haven't been able to make it because of of uh the pandemic and now this you know it's like who's gonna what's gonna happen there come on that's hilarious i can okay i can empathize tickets are expensive planning is hard i could see kind of you know if you're seeing this news in the back of your mind a little part of you is like oh but i just booked and you know like okay i understand but actually coming out and saying that when people have just been talking about the possible refugee crisis it's like that's okay seeming a little bit out of touch maybe we keep that on the inside just yeah she does not care i mean i i don't know what a better way to say it like while people are going through such a traumatic situation she's only thinking about her vacation and it's apparent these people and if if anybody on the right would have said anything close to what she said they will be drugged right now through the mud as a you know a nazi or something so i think it's embarrassing for her to do that but it her true colors have come out it's not shocking it reminds me of um i think it was kelly osbourne either on the view or the talk when talking about trump and illegal immigration was like well where are we going to get our maids from yeah like if they close the border who's going to clean our toilets and so it just shows how out of touch these celebrities are of like they lecture us on privilege and it's like that's where her thought process is like oh no my fancy vacation to italy oh no for me it's the hypocrisy is insane i mean personally i love raw unfiltered elitism i think it's beautiful it's like manuka honey it's just it's just raw it's unfiltered it's good for you sometimes just hear her say it and she genuinely looks scared by the way i'm i i'm sympathizing but she looks scared she's like i haven't been to the amalfi coast in three years literally years she made now i got it she might have to go to cancun it's not what she wants and she's so if this gets into europe she's not going to hit the mediterranean and this is something that you know what joy i feel you girl it's sad it is the mark of privilege i just like i just want people to just see this like we are just in the west just the most privileged out of touch human beings that have ever walked the face of the planet and i gotta i gotta give credit to my girl joy behar for that do you know what big tech and big government have in common they both want to silence any dissenting voices into submission let's say you're a proud gun owner and you want to talk on social media about the right to bear arms well chances are that your posts will be flagged by a content moderator and you might end up on some kind of government watch list to fight back against having your voice censored by both big tech and big government i recommend expressvpn the problem with big tech is that not only do they attempt to send to you but they also

people i have to say that it's just a lot of rules every day like i don't it's like playing a game of simon says but like very fast very quick speed simon says new rules simon says that some white people may choose the yellow emoji thumbs up because it feels neutral personally i choose it because it's the first one i don't want to pick color pick but some academics argue opting out of the white one signals that you are um not aware about your own white privilege skin to society associating whiteness with being raceless i do not merely opt out of the white one i exclusively choose the absolute blackest emoji for restorative justice usually it's the fist in the air because i think anything less i would not be an ally yeah but that was two weeks ago and i'm telling you the rules okay all right and now if you do anything but the whitest one then it's because you're not aware of your own white privilege and someone was paid to obviously look into this and someone with a phd likely came up to this and recognized this somebody with a phd probably in psychology that's true very smart person who's been at the university for a long time wrote this incredibly serious doctrine regarding thumbs up emojis it's funny how to get it it's funny how the game change you know the reason that we got colors in the first place is because i guess the yellow wasn't good enough and it wasn't inclusive they put the colors on the spectrum now now opting out of certain colors is racist it's out of control i mean i used the brown one but at first they didn't have the brown when they matched my skin so i had to go with the yellow one they finally got the darker one in there and now i got a skin tone so but it's it's ridiculous because it never ends they're going to keep going down

thumbs i feel like it's not interesting quite frankly it's not inclusive enough and so i think that we should do away with the yellow one and make it more inclusive and i don't know how to do that other than having nothing no emojis would be the best we should pretend that well in particular it's tricky for us sicilians so it's we're the most depressed minority and people don't realize this but this is i do i do you do you're an ally candace because during the summer our skin changes dramatically and so you've got to change your emojis with with the day of august and so you so you do it and i guess this is very progressive because everything's on a spectrum everything's always on a spectrum the best thing you can be in these times is sicilian in the summer time in august that's what i was gonna say they don't identify like what a struggle it is for white women like white girls like me to choose a color because if i'm spray tan do i want the tan or the not white do i go with the middle and then in the winter time when my tans weren't off do i go with the widest one but then that's like well i'm not that white i want to show i got a little color and so it's very confusing and it's very hard for us white girls to navigate the emojis as well yeah and i hate that black lives matter you have to do a video on this on youtube and see how the world responds to it i hate that they're taking our struggle away from white girls and thinking about race about racism because i feel like we need to be understood as well it's a struggle picking an emoji life is struggle in america it's it's very like a struggle in america you forget to put the sunscreen on and you turn into a lobster they need a red one it's not fair it's not fair it's very oppressive spoken like a man who's married to a white woman i'm guessing she turns red like a lot of people she burned in the car even when we got tanning windows she got put sunscreen i'm like babe we just driving in the car what you need sunscreen i'm telling you it's not it's not it's not a shuffler i wish thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell

place but occasionally some light breaks through if you have been online in the past few weeks you are probably familiar with the viral video of radio host and father ty smith criticizing the idea of teaching critical race theory at a school board meeting in illinois let's take a look you're gonna deliberately teach kids this white kid right here got it better than you because he white you're gonna perfectly tell a white kid oh the black people are all down and suppressed how do i have two medical degrees if i'm sitting here oppressed how do i get first of all [Applause] two medical degrees no mom no dad in the house work my way through college sat there and hustled my butt off to get new cars you gonna tell me somebody look like all your white folks kept me from doing that are you serious so amazing everyone please welcome to the show ty smith wow so that was incredible and i think first questions would just be what is the back story to this like what made you decide to go to the school board meeting what is the story i was simply asked to go and what i was told is that tai there's no one that's in the black community that ever shows up in these school board meetings and some of the big topics that they talk about is what's going on in the black neighborhoods and they're trying to introduce this type of what they call curricula into the school system that may possibly be teaching kids basically to be racist against each other and i'm like what is this there's like it's called critical race theory so different friends of mine handed me different versions almost like a bible like you got the new international version the king james version of critical race theory and i'm reading through all these things but once i read through them the basis of it was they are teaching racism they are teaching kids to be racist against each other and so when i went to this school board meeting i got to sitting down i just wanted to hear everybody's take on it because i read it i got my take from it i heard people get up and talk about what their take was on you had a you got some that actually opposed it the majority were like they're for it like this is what we need this needs to be taught because it's our fault what's happening to the black people look what we've done our forefathers they're they we've inherited their dna and because of that our white privilege this is what we're doing to the black communities and as i sat there no kidding because i was so in tune what everybody was talking about i literally looked around the corner like this on my shoulder like there ain't no black folks in here yeah i was the only one that was in there that was black and they're actually talking about somebody who looks exactly like me so i let everybody kind of say their piece and i just like okay i'm gonna wait and after that i just had to get up and just explode and let these people know you have completely in other words lost your mind if you're going to tell me that based off the color of your skin and everybody naturally in that room was white as you seen i turn around so you're going to tell me one of you why people kept me from doing this absolutely not that's nonsense and once that was over and done do you think anybody approached me and said well hey this is where you're wrong at right right none i hope you are enjoying the show just a brief break to remind you guys that in april alone under joe biden's administration consumer prices rose by 4.2 that is the highest bump since 2008. higher fuel prices higher food prices

know that this is being taught and would be similarly outraged if anybody sat them down and said hey look at this look at this documentation are you okay is this acceptable to you and i think because it's called critical race theory you go okay maybe they're learning a little bit of history or whatever the classes are they're always called something different that's the left is really good at and yet it's so poisonous to the young minds of the black youth to separate people quite literally to assign attributes to them based on the color of their skin so how do we get the word out i guess is what i'm asking you well one way is simply by actually like how that video went viral but even before then i was actually i might actually when i say in the video i'm actually in the community talking to kids definitely dealing with the parents because number one i always start with the parents first and of course we know that 70 some plus percent of all blacks don't have a father and a home so i know it's a 90 chance that the kids that i'm dealing with and the mothers that i'm dealing with that is not there so when i talk to these parents they're usually a lot of young mothers they don't even have an idea what it is so when i when this video came out they were all like so what wait a minute what is it that they're talking about they're going to be teaching my son and i'm like okay well i'll tell you what instead of me just telling you i want you to read it and then in a day or two you come back and tell me what did you get from that no they are not going to be teaching my son this and see even they were able to pick it up but they had no idea that the school system is trying to implement it into this education and so this is what got me after that video came out all of a sudden different people that i don't even know of came well we're not teaching it yet we were just thinking about things like oh it's almost like the equivalence of me seeing a kid being lured away by a stranger with candy and as he being lured away i go over there and i bust it up and the stranger goes well i wasn't going to kidnap them or anything i just want to see if you want to see my truck right yeah that's exactly right that is exactly right so you went to this meeting and somebody said to you actually they're sitting here conversing about black people and yet there's no black people there which signifies obviously that they are just operating on a black stereotype right this is the stereotype of what a black person is yes and i am the bearer of my forefathers sins which by the way i mean forget dating back a time of slavery i don't even want to be responsible for my mom and dad's sins i'm not inheriting any of that nonsense right we're individuals and you're responsible for things that you do wrong but there's this tremendous amount of white guilt right white guilt what do you think about that because it is weird it's completely what i call white guilt is either you virtue signaling or it's just as you've been you've been taught to believe something that's completely falsified you know you've been you're being told to feel bad about something that you don't even know you know you're not responsible for so wait a minute i'll give you an example i told people when i saw videos of these different churches doing the same thing where they had i don't know if you've seen them you probably have where they showed white people bowing down and having hands up telling we're sorry for our forefathers and what they did god you know we forgive us for what art and i'm sitting there thinking like what in the world is that so what i do when i go to neighborhoods i told them what would y'all do if i had every black child that don't have a father in the home if i got down before all those children and said i'm so sorry for what the black fathers have not done i'm so sorry that is that my fault no it's your father's fault that decided to leave you so how would i take on a responsibility and take on all that pressure and take on all that pain and put that blame on me for their father not being in the home right and so when you bring things like that to people they kind of get to thinking like well when you put it that way yeah so i'm like so what are you feeling guilty about do you actually feel guilty or were you just told to feel guilty hey guys

office again i think that there has also been this element and you and i have had a similar experience i obviously notoriously went to congress um i had to testify at a hearing about white supremacy and notably i was the only black person testifying about the experience of white supremacy and how it's impacting black people and i remember the frustration at listening to you know all of these white people who have phds in meaninglessness you know phd and racism and white supremacy and they're talking about black people and it never once occurred for them to just listen to me right and so you kind of said that you had a similar experience where it's it's a bizarre thing it's like you step into a weird world where you realize you know is this even about black people anymore or is this just white people trying to make themselves feel superior to their other white peers right like hey i know i know i i'm white and i know it better than me otherwise because i see what's going on with the blacks and the blacks don't know what's going on the blacks because we don't they just don't know and that's why we're telling their story right and i'm sitting here like i am the story you're going to tell my story for me and so for me to come out of the ghetto for me to come out of the hood for me to come out of seeing people getting murdered in my face i'm talking about flat-out murder y'all you have no idea the psychological effects these type of things can have on you so you end up becoming numb you see so much crime that you become numb and so in a sense i'm kind of thankful for that because a lot of stuff that's coming at me right now i don't care no no no white person can sit there and tell me my experience and no white person can sit there and tell me that a black person cannot achieve anything they do not want to achieve i know that y'all trying to push when i say y'all i mean like this system this this narrative is trying to be pushed on kids on children on black people that the reason why they cannot achieve anything is because of what is something that something that happened completely in the past what about right now what can you do right now how does something happen that many years ago is affecting you right now and some of them tried to come out and say things like well we want true history taught and they always go to christopher columbus he didn't discover america blah blah blah blah and i'm like okay well can we go beyond that can we go how did the slaves get here let's talk about that if you want to talk about real history how did the slaves get here who sold the slave do you really believe that three boats came to that big giant continent in africa where all these black people is and they just said let's go round them up even if they had guns and all africans had spears and shoot guns there is no way you're going to overtake that continent and just steal black people so if you want to talk about real history let's talk about how somebody look exactly like you sold you to those white people well no we don't want to go there oh no no we want to go there you say you want to talk about the truth we're going to talk about the truth and when you do that they instantly try to deflect and get on something else well what makes you so what no we're not talking about reroute can we stay on the subject and that's what they like to do but to sit there and try to take away my experience and what i had to go through and how uh i put my mind to wanted to achieve something there was nothing that was there guys i was so so not even so ignorant that when they told me that there was the white man and there was a systemic racism institutionalized racism i believed it so much that i went out asking looking for that man and that man in that system whoever it was it did not exist and once i found out it didn't notice this there was nothing that was stopping me thanks for joining me on this episode of candace if you liked this

"increasingly we're seeing especially in these times how important state rights are i mean you just look back and you think the founding fathers really understood just exactly how corrupt and awful a federal government could become and states have stepped up we've seen texas step up tennessee where i'm from we never had any any of these mandates um uh florida you know desantis has really come into his own i have to say i wasn't when he was running i wasn't the greatest desantis fan he was running against gillum but i think that the covid era has kind of you know asserted him as a leader something else the press is saying is that this is going to be a 2024 standoff and that there's friction in the background between your dad and desantis is that all nonsense or is there some legitimacy to that there's no friction no friction between friction in fact you know i remember you know campaigning actively for uh desantis back in the day and frankly i've always remembered how thankful he was you know without donald trump um yeah and i think he'd be the first one to say this i'm not saying anything that's controversial but you know my father pushed very very hard for him and um just got him over the finish line my father believed in him and he just barely got over and thank god i mean look what happened to gillum in the aftermath of that race between the drugs and this and that and that's when who broke the story would you uh would you want him running the great state of florida but it's really interesting you mentioned state rights you know new york has lost 1.7 of its population to other states think about that right so all of a sudden they take a state and they restrict freedoms and you know everybody has to wear a mask and you know show me your card and you know all this other you know nonsense they let the streets get dangerous they stopped you know all the kind of no bail and this and that and allowing crazy criminals back out on the street and all the problems that new york has and guess what all of a sudden you see states like tennessee where you're from and from you know texas and florida flourish and the founding fathers probably had it right in in that states should decide a lot of things but i think also when you have individual choice in society when states start making the wrong choice people just leave and that hurts the state at hand and it probably gets them to actually reverse course there's probably more genius in kind of the state's rights um structure than we even understood kind of until now pre-covered world and i think about that a lot yeah i totally do now i'm like i wow i just i want to kiss the founding fathers now i you really don't understand it until you really need to understand it you go do your thing yeah but when it becomes a show and when you drive the country or your state into the ground and when everybody leaves and when you allow crime to go crazy then actually the pendulum starts tacking back the other way and you've you've seen that i mean look at the difference between mayor de blasio here in new york and you know eric adams right like de blasio let the crime go so far that you have a new mayor who's fighting every single day to try and clean up the streets whether or not they'll be successful i guess time will tell right but the pendulum went from over here it swung all the way the other way and without states rights that probably wouldn't be the case with a baby at home and another one on the way i have to pay very close attention to the products that i bring into my home

fun question you can have dinner with anybody dead or alive you can't say trump you can't well you are trump but you can't say your father i've already had dinner with him plenty of times how about jesus jesus that's a good answer that'd be a good one right what would you ask him oh god did you envision this happening to the united states of america and did you ever envision a person as incompetent as joe biden running the united states of america how in the world did this happen i i honestly i might ask him if this is actually a ploy to show people the difference between republican leadership and democratic leadership like you know sometimes i think about that you know is is this part of the yeah you have donald trump who had just four years of despite all everything they tried to do to destroy him again you know greatest unemployment manufacturing was coming back to this country you know stability in the middle east the likes of which we've never seen before and you just go through all the accomplishments and then in about three weeks this guy comes in and you've got you know gas prices double and you have inflation absolutely through the roof and you have the loss of civil liberties you have crime going through the roof you've got christmas presents that can't be delivered because store shelves are empty because you have boat after boat after boat ship you know 200 miles off the coast of la they moved them out because they didn't want to be embarrassed how many ships are sitting out there waiting to try and unload their goods you see this dichotomy between two people and that's stark contrast does that actually help educate kind of the united states and i think it really might thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video

your opinion though on them developing this poster child it's actually a poster adult even though she wears pigtails a lot she is 19 or 20 now but Greta thundberg where did she come from she's suddenly on the cover let's just hear her in her own words because she's this is now her full-time job of climate alarmism [Applause] there is no Planet B there is no Planet blah blah blah blah blah blah blah this is not about some expensive politically correct green Act of bunny hugging or blah blah blah build back better blah blah blah green economy blah blah blah Net Zero by 2050 blah blah blah net zero blah blah blah climate neutral blah blah blah I just want to know how she keeps getting applauded so I'm gonna try it blah blah blah nailed it yeah you have to just shake your head at things like that she's gotten a great she's she arrived at the right place at the right time and I think she was a creature of this meaty manipulation um she's done a great job promoting a non-existent crisis uh hurt and in fact when we talk about this you heard me say before there is no climate crisis her Solutions is what I would call a solution in search of a problem because if we don't have a problem we not only shouldn't spend three and a half trillion we shouldn't spend one red Cent right to solve a non-existent crisis and it's what they're planning right now their solution is to drive everybody away from gas fossil fuels and their solution to that is to increase energy costs for everybody any energy coming from fossil fuels fueling your cars and what does that mean when you increase energy prices for one thing it's a regressive taxation scheme by that I mean it hurts the poorest Among Us the most a progressive would punish the wealthy regressive taxation punishes the poorest the poorests spend the highest percentage of their income on energy they'll be hurt the worst the Democrats and Joe Biden is a woman for the little guy if you're for the little guy you want to provide that abundant affordable energy we talked about before not make it more expensive and once you've done that if you're a widget manufacturer in Ohio and your costs go up you're going to pass that along consumers you're going to get you're going to need to move your widgets to Market that increases your costs it increases costs and just add to the inflationary spiral that we're in right now and again it'll hamstring America when we're competing with these other countries like China and India that are booming right now that are growing we will get back to the show in a second but

they know that it was me who sent you so in my opinion more people need to hear and this is why I always say to people if you want to get started on climate change they need to read this book inconvenient facts and more people need to hear your voice which is exactly why most people don't want you to speak people that are in control rather don't want you to speak you recently got banned from LinkedIn is that correct it is yeah it was yeah when you listen to this you don't know whether to laugh or cry so about a month and a half ago my post and again I post on science they started every post I put up they Jank it down false and misleading the last post before I got banned I posted I think I'm about to be de-platformed and banned on LinkedIn they removed it said it was false and misleading and then de-platformed of man Banned Me I was like what so I I appealed it and I just got the appeal and I said I will follow all the rules for LinkedIn and I will only post factually correct data and you know some like 18 year old intern that's obviously putting misleading on a geologist that's actually talking about stuff that he understands about the planet because that's how the world works now right so they they said no your band your band permanently case closed because we don't allow that kind of information on LinkedIn remember I said I'll only post factually correct information right we don't allow that I don't like that you know there's this we know there's a 22 or 20 something guy sitting in in California in this basement you know hitting cancel with gliese and there were the man bun and tattoo I'm not opposed to man buns and Tattoos probably but you know he's got a sustainable degree in sustainability or something absolutely well I just I just want to get your take I know we have to wrap up I want to get your take on all of this because like it's funny but it's also scary that geologists scientists now doctors nurses uh we covered earlier on my show that people who died and their family put up an obituary of what actually happened uh are being fact check censored labeled as misleading and taken off of the web um I can't think of a more totalitarian state than when people who know the truth are not even allowed to share it what is your take on things in terms of the scientific Community are you optimistic are you pessimistic and where do we go from here I'm pessimistic in terms of scientific Community we don't we find that the only people that actually propose things like this are either retired or they're well enough long in their University career they're not going to be fired we see scientists time after time being fired and run out of the scientific Community it takes a very very brave scientist and a brave person to stand up to this this whole Community that's saying that there's a 97 consensus and we find there aren't very many brave people in this community well and what I applaud those that do right well then

"tPuRn0wdVr4": "up in pop culture i want to talk about zielinski at the grammys because i just cannot take this seriously anymore so zolensky he's under fire he's surviving 32 000 assassination attempts a day he makes a lot of time to do press for someone who i mean i would think that you wouldn't want to attach yourself to the internet too much if you were facing assassination attempts every day we don't know where he is we know he's in front of a green screen and he's speaking to the grammys so let's cut to a video of that here to introduce a very special performance led by john legend is the president of ukraine vladimir zelinski the word what's more opposite to music the silence of ruined cities and killed people our children draw swooping rockets not shooting stars over 400 children have been injured and 153 children died to all our cities the war is destroying and others their legends already but i have a dream of them living and free free like you on the grim stage i'm laughing not about what's happening the citizens of ukraine but just how this just doesn't look real like this just looks like a hollywood script to me everything about this guy also a part of it manager actually is an actor um and played the role of acting like a president i just i cannot imagine the prioritization process that went on behind the scenes when they said hey you've got a request to be at the american grammys at the same time he's telling us that we need to suit up our sons and our daughters so we can march into world war three he makes time to make an appearance at the grammys and read from a teleprompter i mean am i crazy or is this insane well of course usual disclaimer what's happening in ukraine is awful solidarity with ukrainian people et cetera um but i i'm like you i'm kind of starting to resent um being goaded into entering a war and i say this as a canadian who canada has now donated so many arms to ukraine it was actually announced that we have no more weapons as a military which essentially does not make you a country um so i'm very concerned about this and also i was quite upset about you know how he talks about this war specifically as the ultimatum of ukrainian freedom would let's not forget just a few months ago you've done great work exposing this uh we were happy to talk about ukraine as a corrupt country again this does not justify any military action russia is doing in ukraine or anything like that but i have a problem when hollywood and the media and western politicians are trying to whitewash the situation into now we must support zielinski as a president through military means or else we are unpatriotic and hate-free why don't you take the send the taliban they've got all our weapons anyways you know what i mean send the taliban on behalf of america send the taliban they've got billions of dollars of american weapons sam and adam kinzinger just go ahead yeah yeah if you're like most people there's a box of your

mean look i think the taboos around russia are just getting weirder and weirder every day i actually i'm a big tennis fan i went to a tennis tournament miami last friday and i noticed the top women's seat in doubles she was the one person of the four on the court who didn't have rus her country label under her and i'm just now we've gotten to a place where it's actually become an unspeakable word and for me this war is also about looking in the mirror okay this may be a little bit uncouth to say and i do not i say this with the usual ritual condemnations but i mean it that what vladimir putin i believe is doing wrong is wrong but i think it is an occasion for us to look in the mirror and ask ourselves what actually distinguishes us from them there are certain words that are unspeakable here in the united states in that tennis match you could not put the letters r-u-s part of living in a free country means that you are actually free to speak openly that is what makes a war worth fighting vladimir putin takes down the bbc he bans facebook that's what a dictator does well guess what neo-nazis literally neo-nazis fighting for him and he's by the way but he also silences members of the opposition party that's what vladimir putin is i'm not even talking about ukraine though candace i'm talking about the united states you have a member of the opposition party in right now who cannot use social media we have social media giants that today at behest of government action censor hate speech and misinformation just like vladimir putin does directly and in fact in the united states it is less transparent because at least when putin bans the bbc he says he bans the bbc the united states says we don't ban anything they just tell our are effectively our autocrats in silicon valley to do the dirty work of the government behind us and so for me this is one of those moments where we're using the cultural smoke screen of the grammys of celebrities of the new esg culture that suddenly decided that the esg thing to do is fight the war on behalf of ukraine against russia to cover up for the fact that actually we need to do the hard work of looking ourselves in the mirror and ask us what is it that we're fighting for in the first place and are we sure we're really embodying that here in the united states with this cultural totalitarianism that there's not a person in that room at the grammys say they had a descending opinion of the 500 people in that room that could have stood up and said that well i think there's more nuance to this situation no they would have been shouted out and shown the door and i think that that's one of the weird things about this emerging cancel culture around russia that really bothers me is that they have totalitarianism over there but let's look in the mirror and think about the cultural totalitarianism over here and if we lose if we have that over here and lose our actual cultural freedoms we lose the very things that we were supposedly fighting for and had moral authority to stand up to russia against in the first place that's exactly right that's exactly right and i have been saying that since long before ukraine and russia ever went to war i've been saying that we have seeded the moral high ground and it became very apparent when i believe it was nbc that was sitting down with putin and they started asking him questions about the way that he treats his political opponents and putin hit them back and said what about january 6. you guys lock up political decisions dissidents too and and i went okay he actually is making a valid point again this was pre-pre-russia ukrainian war and this idea that he would make an appearance in front of hollywood i mean this is that is so emblematic of everything that's wrong in this society why don't you make an appearance in front of the army the art people that are in the army why don't you make an appearance on the ground people who you are asking to go over there and die you want to go to hollywood elites none of them of which will be sending their sons or their daughters into this war as they all make sad videos and poems like anna uh what was her name annika mccord who did a poem to putin and that's all you're going to get from them right dear putin this is not how you should be and we feel very sad about what you're doing we don't care about these people anymore you know news flash zelensky like the actors and the hollywood weirdos are no longer running this country the american people are seeing right through them and we have a right to talk about your corruption as much as we talk about putin's corruption as much as we talk about biden's corruption i'm on none of their sides thanks for joining me on this segment of candice if you

you ever think about a future in politics for you i know that laura they were like really wanting her to run down north carolina she's from north carolina have you ever thought about getting into politics you guys seem to have the fortitude you know you are obviously experienced with it i can't imagine anything could be a curveball after what you've gone through nothing would be a curveball for me probably not never rule anything out but probably not um laura was doing amazing i mean in all the pull and she made the decision not to go for send in north carolina but there were politico polls where she was at 61 percent in nate way race and you know i mean i think she would have walked into that seat i really do and um you know there's a lot of different factors to that first of all we've seen the game and the game isn't all that much fun right it's rewarding because you can accomplish great things um but again the weaponization of the systems right well again i mentioned the washington post story right within 12 minutes they were already trying to impeach my father like that's the system the system doesn't give the person who actually wants to run for politics you know for a great reason my father put aside billions of dollars billions and billions of dollars for this effort he's the first candidate ever to fund his own campaigns right the toll it had on us as a family was probably very different than many others we're the first family that probably came out of washington exponentially worse than when we got in right it's amazing because we just turned down a lot of things during that period of time by the way don't cry for us right you look at obama he goes in there as a civil servant now he's buying houses in martha's vineyard for 30 million dollars right i mean it's really interesting how that works you know the system doesn't reward people that want to go in that are incredibly competent to do a great job the system rewards crooks who literally you know nurse off of the american people for their entire lives never accomplish anything the system rewards those people and so do i want to do it i don't know i'm a real estate guy i'm a bricks and mortar guy um i love this country i love red white and blue i'll fight like hell for this country if my father decides to do it again in 2024 you better believe i will be the first person to stand by his side and you know go to war um i still do that every single day right now as we get attacked but whether or not i want to step into that arena i don't know time will tell but it's uh we've seen a really amazing world a lot of it's not the greatest world but we've seen a very very interesting world and i think it's taught us a tremendous amount i hope you're enjoying this conversation with eric trump we'll get back to it in just a moment but first let's talk about inflation 40 years ago ronald reagan saw massive inflation unlike anything the country had ever seen before until today in

about these crooks and the establishment this is something that has always confused me i do not understand your family's support of the rnc like and i asked this question because i think a lot of conservatives have this question because you know they're obviously good people in the rnc but i don't know that they have been supportive of you or or whether or not they have just earned money after the fact you know what i mean i don't know that the rnc is seen as conservatives is that a part of the establishment is it is the rnc very different from the dnc like what is your perspective on that i think there's a lot of good people in the rnc um i think in the political spectrum there's always somebody who's trying to you know milk off of others right i think the fact that my father wears the r it means that anybody who's affiliated with r is going to try and extract anything they possibly can out of that person i think that's natural isn't nice hey there's a bunch of senators out there who you know aren't great um who campaign off my father every single day even though they know that my father doesn't like him right you know you could name all of the ones that i'm thinking about right now right they won't be supportive they won't do this and that but when it's time to actually go out there and campaign they know my father has you know 98 of the republican base or whatever it may be and they'll go try and raise the money off of his name and you know welcome to washington dc right that is washington uh there are a lot of good people um at the rnc that much i can say um are there probably rhinos over there yeah i'm sure there are plenty of rhinos associated with as well did they do some really good things have a great ground game and other things that would be very very hard for a campaign to set up especially a campaign where we didn't know what the hell we were doing i mean we didn't know what an iowa caucus was i joke about this all the time but i remember going to iowa caucuses and i look at this little campaign staffer and i go like what are we doing here well sir you're going to give a speech in front of 5 000 people in a you know gymnasium and tell them why you know your father is better than they are and i go who's they and well jeb bush is going to speak right next to you and ted cruz is saying there was like these people know something about the world of politics i know nothing about the world of politics right and so we weren't we didn't have the capacity to create ground game we didn't have the capacity to you know and so um i think they had a very big role thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new videos to watch or listen

what's actually happening in the war the narrative at first was putin's losing it's going to be over and ziyada and it turns out that so you would have these like these like blue checks who'd never spend any time in the military look at like a you know a picture of a truck stuck in the mud and say aha this means that russia's like do you understand the russian army do you have any idea how many battles they fought on literally this very same terrain right just from a top-down view this is the germany area where 80 years ago they defeated the entire wermacht the entire german army under mar was the russian general marshall zhukov who's like their greatest general that they consider so yeah i'm pretty sure that in the russian military academies they're studying martial zhukov and how he defeated the germans they didn't use this blitzkrieg type of combat they're not studying crt they're not they're not studying crt there's no gender studies i've never seen you know i've never had you know a russian ask me what my pronouns are um in fact i've never i've been looking for this i haven't seen a single picture on either side ukrainian or russian of anyone wearing a mask and all of it have you noticed that take it look for it you're gonna look for it now every time you look you'll never see it because they don't care they care about real stuff and [Laughter] when you see this fighting what they do is they don't do these thunder runs and massive decapitation strikes like the us does they go for encirclement strategy it's they are going to ground and pound and they go all the way around the city cut off your forces cut you off and then they st it's a slow strangulation that goes on all the way through and so and yeah it might look sloppy compared to way we do it it might not look like the most efficient supply lines but guess what like they eventually get there and that's been the history of every single russian war in the modern era going back a hundred years but our idiots in the u.s military and the us government don't seem to want to look at this so what do we see happening now you can see this these encirclement operations they call them cauldrons actually cauldrons um you can see this happening in the east where they're trying to encircle about 50 000 ukrainian forces right now and you're starting probably you're probably going to see some ukrainians trying to bug out and get into the west now because if if they get in circle they're done it's either you surrender or you will be annihilated you're also seeing this happening within smaller encirclements that are going around so you have uh chains of encirclements as they lead up towards the city of kiev itself and as far as the south goes they've already constructed a land bridge from crimea coming up north to the city of kursan and then all the way back to the east connecting it to that donbass region so a perfect example if we had a map but yeah i think we can pull up but actually if you think of sort of an inverted sea that's what they've done and they've really just pushed that entire eastern border of ukraine down and the the general goal at this point then is to come up from the south from crimea come down from the north with units that were based out of uh actually on the territory of belarus and then down and split ukraine in half north and south along that river if they're able to do so and then those eastern regions that you were talking about those predominantly russian-speaking regions who are cheering for russia will effectively well there's it's mixed it is next um you've got areas where you see that you've also got areas where there's strong resistance at least in terms of the local opinion um but you know the ground forces have been decimated by and large you don't you're not seeing these massive you know tank on tank battle in in many of these areas it's really light infantry tactics or you know gorilla gorilla front inflation is out of control and we see that more than ever in the grocery store prices keep hitting new all-time highs for meat and seafood cooking and grilling at home used to be the way to save money but with

you know you really see these guys on twitter saying stuff like these idiots saying you know go throw a molotov cocktail at a tank or you know go i saw this guy tweeting look i'm a tank engineer and i think that the best way to do is get your ak-47 and stand in the road and just aim for his view plate and if you can get the window where the guy's driving then you can take yeah that's a tank yeah yeah it's got explosive tipped shells they're going to blow you up and everybody around you and unfortunately that's what you see happening and you see them using these you can go video after video where they're putting these javeline missiles even on the top rooftops of buildings so what do you think the tank's going to do if they know they're being fired at from the roof of a various building here and there so they're going to respond again these are armored units and that's why this battalion they some people are calling it the reddit battalion they're these um these volunteers of foreign fighters that have come from the west that all went in to the u.s thinking that oh this is going to be like iraq or afghanistan we're just fighting a bunch of like um you know terrorist groups no this is a serious military so what did russia do they found the barracks where all these guys were staying and they knew the coordinates because guess what everybody had been posting there on social media and what did russia do they took it out with 30 cruise missiles wow wow is there anything more western than that here we are you know here we are so yeah i hope you guys got some cloud on instagram or you know before you got completely annihilated but this is this is i hope you got some cloud on instagram but that's sadly this is a conventional force and so you are seeing people i just saw a video even before we came on here a guy saying um american former army national guard he said look you know we snuck out in the back of an ambulance because these guys were telling us that they were going to send us to kiev with like 10 rounds per magazine and go to the front lines like that's how bad it's gotten in ukraine right now zelinski has come out from the political side and said you know which he probably should have said a month ago um ukraine will not become a member of nato yeah well he's not allowed to talk about that we just that it really was that simple i mean it i hate to say it but like it it really was that simple like nato needs to stop playing games over there if you actually cared about the ukrainian people you know and you didn't want them to go through this in which we all feel so sad for the ukrainian citizens i mean to imagine picking up your home packing up your life you know the refugee crisis that this is creating and i want to also talk to you about poland because you've had some interesting tweets um that this is creating it's it's devastating for for the ukrainian people who have nothing to do with their corrupt government in the same way that we have nothing to do with our corrupt government and the same of the russian citizens has something to do with their corrupt governments but this could have been avoided with a more sober conversation about why nato just cannot let this go and they feel the need to expand eastward into what putin has defined very clearly as his red line for decades this is not this is not new this is not uh you know took a bad shot of steroid right um this is this is a real conversation though no great power would allow a hostile military you'd be an idiot to allow a military force as a possibility threat to you on your borders you'd be an idiot if the government of mexico let's say a revolution broke out in mexico right that's i think everyone could see a revolution breaking out in mexico that's not hard to imagine and suddenly the chinese came in and the ccp installed a pro-china government an alliance with russia and china like they say oh and then signed a signed a military agreement saying that we're going to put chinese forces in mexico on the u.s border it's 100 miles away from the u.s border we're going to have chinese forces but we would always we would all be arguing we would all be arguing for an invasion of mexico and that's what people don't understand they need to actually put themselves in his circumstance that's not in support of putin but it helps you better understand what is happening

like i don't understand how you have the patience to be a congressman like literally how do you have the patience to sit there and to listen to them lie and to throw these ridiculous hearings when there's real problems i'd like to see a hearing on the opioid you know epidemic that we're facing in this country and yet they just sit here and just go we're going to just paint republicans like racists for you know every second that we get well i don't pretend that my job's any harder than the folks i get the privilege of representing and you know everyone's got to deal with government you run a business you got to do you run a business you got to deal with government all the time the taxes the regulation everything else so i don't pretend it's any harder but i do think it's a privilege and you know in the history of our great country only about 12 000 people in the in the history of the greatest nation ever only about 12 000 people have had the opportunity to serve in the united states congress if you get that chance go do what you said you would do go fight for the things the folks back home elected you to fight for and if you take that attitude then you can you can put up with maxine waters yelling at you and jamie raskin doing things like you did in that hearing and the false statements that get made about me all the time which i know you get every single day as well so you can put up with that and frankly it's no harder than than families in our district who are trying to make a go of it and do the best thing for their family and run their business and and be involved in their school and all the things that that people in this great country are involved in i mean that's a great perspective to have and i think that one of the things that people get so frustrated with is that there's just so much blatant corruption which brings me to january 6 and this ridiculous committee and nancy pelosi i think i read literally yesterday in the news she's blocking her text messages which she was sending out she was the person that was in control of the police personnel but she does not want anyone to have access to her messages meanwhile they're subpoenaing messages from people that weren't even present on the day of january 6th like cleta mitchell um what is what is your reaction to all of this well you're right why is the speaker of the house stopping not letting the sergeant-at-arms those communications that took place prior to january 6 when there was a debate about whether the national guard should be there and it's interesting we have conflicting testimony we have the chief of the capitol hill police saying he asked for national guard to be present on january 6 and then you have the sergeant-at-arms saying no you did it and it's the one who said no you didn't who won't turn over their information won't turn over communications and documents the one who said you did has so why is that well the one that won't turn them over answers directly to the speaker of the house and the speaker of house has directed at that office through house counsel who also answers directly to the speaker not to turn over that communication why is that why wouldn't you want to turn that over so um but we know this committee is is completely partisan i mean that i i put this list together you think about it democrats have objected to counting the electors every single time a republican has been elected to the presidency this century democrats spent four years trying to overturn the 2016 election democrats spied on a presidential campaign democrats did impeachment in secret based on a so-called whistleblower whose identity only adam schiff got to know democrats have kicked republicans off committee won't let republicans serve on the select committee democrats have uh locked down the capital democrats have enacted prosec proxy voting they're trying to make d.c estate they're trying to in the electoral college they're trying to in the filibuster they're trying to pack the court they're trying to nationalize elections and they're going to let illegal immigrants vote and they're already doing that in some locales and finally the january 6 committee has altered evidence and presented it to the american people lie to the american people now and yet they say republicans are a threat to democracy i mean think about that that is just craziness but that is that is the problem with this january 6 committee is they don't want to turn on the information that we need which speaker pelosi can can have happen and they want to just attack their political enemies and go after president trump before we continue with the show i want to take a moment to talk to you about inflation right now inflation is at a 40-year high and it's here to stay because here's the government's dirty little secret they want it that way think about this right now inflation rates are higher than the interest on treasury bonds so as every day that passes the government owes less on its mountain of debt imagine if your mortgage had a negative interest rate would you be in a hurry to pay it off exactly so your pain is their gain the good news is you can protect your savings now and hedge against inflation with gold from birch gold birch gold will help you convert an eligible ira or a 401k into an ira backed by real gold now that's peace of mind with thousands of satisfied customers and an a-plus rating with the better business bureau you can trust birch gold to protect your savings text candace to 98989 to get a free info kit on holding gold in a tax sheltered account then call birch and protect your hard earned savings text candace to 989898 to get your free info kit now that has been i think the frustration you know as as just a citizen watching this process is that we know that they get away with everything i mean i was living in dc nine months pregnant way before i gave birth when january 6 happened i remember my phone blowing up and so many people ask me if i was okay and i'm going are you asking me if i'm okay about the six weeks of burning down that my city has just faced because of the george floyd protest when we woke up every morning and a car was burned down something was broken into and this was totally fine when they were trying to pull down statues none of this was considered an insurrection are you asking me if i was okay during the week of the brett kavanaugh trials talking about storming the capital when they were storming into the buildings they're sitting down in the offices can you imagine you have aoc you think she almost died and she was in a separate building right could you imagine they remember when they stormed the chuck grassley's office the women a little a little hand they got slapped on the wrist immediately released people saying we're going to pay to get them out of prison and then i'm looking at these images of what happened in the capitol building and i'm going this is diet compared to what i've lived through for the last four years under a trump presidency with protests and riots every single weekend so there is this frustration and i think part of the frustration is people want to know have are republicans doing enough when they have power now of course it's nearly impossible right you just have to do as much as you can but what about you know the first two years of trump in office right we had power do we just not fight as hard or as dirty perhaps as the democrats are willing to fight well we we're going to have to fight harder and i agree with you and i think that the main point is too republicans are consistent republicans condemn violence every time it happens we condemn the violence on january 6 and we condemn all the violence that took place in the summer of 2020 where think about portland it was a hundred day siege on the federal building the federal courthouse i mean a hundred days where they were attacking the courthouse attacking federal property oh that was fine in fact so fine that democrat elected officials raised money to bail the riders and looters out of jail i mean you think about that summer democrats talked about reimagining the police defunding the police saying that actual rioters and looters who attacked police were peaceful protesters so we've been consistent they haven't and when we do get power back which i think is going to happen i don't think we should get over confident but i think we should be confident as we head into this midterm election that we're going to win if we do we have to be willing to do the investigations need to happen hold people accountable and treat the democrats if they're going to cross some of these bridges or that whole list i just gave you all the unprecedented things they're that they're doing to destroy norms and principles and and and values that we've always had in this country if they're going to do that they're going to cross that bridge and if it's good for one side it's good for the other we have to adopt that attitude and that's exactly i think that's exactly how the american people feel it's like you have to fight fire with fire eventually because it's just not working to turn the other cheek i mean they they have just gained so much in in the past couple of years and i mean especially watching during black lives matter which i think republicans were especially silent on and of course i appreciate the dilemma of like when you're a white person and they're accusing everybody being racist usually republicans just don't even want to fight it but these people were criminals that were burning down the cities by the way the inner cities that the black community lives in it wasn't even like they were doing this in white communities the black community suffered because of this fictitious black lives matter narrative that seems to make an appearance every time there's a presidential election thanks for joining me on

today", "WaWdBzR9DFo": "in many ways it seems like the world has changed so much from producing that kind of a person you know like that kind of a man yeah and I even in my grandfather passing I was just sort of like this world really isn't for him like to see what it's become a Man Who Loved to work and now this world is becoming no one wants to work and it's it's shifted so much and it has especially shifted in music as well you know and you've been an outspoken critic of those changes obviously with the Aaron Lewis song um we just recently saw Jason Aldean came out and said I love this country and he's got a lot to lose but he just kind of came out and said I'm not okay with this what does that feel like in in the background as someone who's seen this industry which I think probably feels very jailed or imprisoned at the moment people can't say anything I mean uh and a little dumbfounded you know when you think about you think about country music as a culture it was invented here as was rock and roll and was blues and jazz they're all culturally American things musics that have shaped the entire globe and think of all the artists that have come out of these genres of music that have that were invented here in America and and country music has always been obviously the themes you know God and Country and flag and family and um lifestyle and um simple and we've seen now those things going away you don't see artists like Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard and George Jones and Willie Willie's still here but you don't see those kind of artists anymore everybody's kind of toeing the line for a different thing now and that's okay I I have to be I'm an older guy now in the music business so I I have to let some of that go and just say okay everything's just changing it always does but when I see those themes go away um like somebody once asked me they said they wanted to start a like conservative record label that would concentrate more on you know like the themes of of America I said well that's that's country music that's basically what we do but he's right it's kind of gone away we will be back to the show in just a moment but first we need to talk about how

thread in all my songs and like with this Aaron Lewis song A lot of people are saying why would Jeff write a song that's this is not Jeff's style I will look back at my catalog I mean all the songs I wrote from Montgomery Gentry my town and something to be proud of were songs about my dad and songs about the country songs about America and change the world changed yeah and I've always I've been doing what I've been doing for 45 years now as a as a writer and um it's a it's a it's a strange time right now I I have a little tidbit from my dad back in the 70s when Jimmy Carter was President my my dad's business went completely down the tubes because he cut back all the metal production my dad was in the you know Machining industry and um so he was literally had to lay everybody off anyway and and um his business was busting and I said man I can't believe this this presidency what's and my my politics for getting shaped as a teenager and he looked at me said son he said we need we need liberals and I look what are you talking about Dad what are you talking about like everything he goes no no no we need him every now and then they come up with good stuff like seat belts and I was like what and he goes he goes but he goes God forbid if they ever take over because we'll lose our country and he said that Back in 77 and I never forgot that no I never thought I'd see the day where things are the way they are right it's controversial to to wave the flag and I mean we've got a song about that we do we're definitely going to Premiere it on this show at some point I would love to we really know I promise before the end of the year we're going to prepare that song I'm very proud of what we wrote um and I think it really it will speak to so many people and it's time for another um not a new national anthem but you know another country music country Anthem aside from lean Greenwood yeah and what we found out with Aaron is people want to hear it people want to hear it people and a lot of people want to hear it and we're getting it's the first time in my career I've been banned you know on Facebook and and what so you know what you know for a song you know they're they're blocking it they don't want people to hear it but it's but it's getting hurt because there is quite a silent majority of people that they want to hear it they love this country and like I always say to people that Constitution's like it's like on an upside down stool a three-legged stool and if you take you you take one of those legs out it just floats and and it's over you know you have to have God family and and morality there and once and they've been just picking at it for years now yeah and they're doing a great job yeah well that means we have to do a better job we have to do a better job and once you break one of those that document just kind of floats and it's gone yeah and it's really that simple and um it's it actually scares the you know what out of me yeah I think it scares a lot of people yeah thanks for joining me on this segment of Candace if you like this video subscribe to this YouTube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new videos if you want to watch

been added to the new york times lexicon i guess they're starting to now use this term menstruator because you know it's offensive to use that disgusting w word that we used to use so um they're you putting that into its copy to describe you know us fellow menstruators um the average menstruator can use thousands of tampons in their lifetime um there used to be a word it's just i'm going to say it because i don't curse it was that w word well no don't don't please this i don't want to get bleep so there's young people watching my show we don't want to get believed i mean this is just i don't even i i can't even i can't even respond to this if i'm being honest with you i can't even respond to this so i'm going to let spencer respond to it oh boy thank you this is this is my male privilege i'm going to mansplain this to you um yeah i need some mansplaining yeah yeah as a as the only man on this panel um no i mean what's what's this is actually heartbreaking to me what this is a story about is a woman who makes menstrual products and her whole line is about shame we shouldn't be ashamed of menstruation we shouldn't be ashamed of our of our bodily functions and i read the way that these people talk about women menstruators birthing people people with chest feeders right and it's like it's filled with shame it speaks shame in every in every word because what are they ashamed of they're ashamed of womanhood they hate the female body they hate its power of the creation of life because there's the one thing with all of their censorship and all of their robots and all of their demands that you shut up and comply they cannot create life the way the body of a human woman can and they and so they and so they make it into right and so they they dehumanize you they tell you it's weak they tell you it's ugly they tell you it's wrong you have to cover it over and go out into the world and act like a man and be strong and be a girl boss it's all because they cannot stand what women are we will get back to the show in just a moment but first let's talk about your internet security using the internet without expressvpn is like leaving your laptop exposed at a coffee shop table while you run to the counter to buy another drink most of the time you're probably going to be fine but what if one day you come back and your laptop is gone every time you connect to an unencrypted network think cafe airport or hotel wi-fi your online data is not secured any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data and it does not take an advanced techy knowledge to hack someone a 12 year old can do it that's why i recommend expressvpn expressvpn creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so that hackers can't steal your sensitive data what i like most about expressvpn is how easy it is to use you simply download the app on your phone or computer tap one button and you're protected secure your online data today with the vpn that i trust by visiting expressvpn.com candice that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com candace you can get an extra three months free and you know what it's so sad because we giving birth is such a beautiful difficult experience and they're trying to make anyone can do it it's no big deal it is a big deal it is special one of the most special moments probably in our lives why can't that be celebrated is something that we've done instead anyone can do it anyone can it's no big deal you're not special for doing this and we are special and it is special enough and i really i mean to me what we're seeing happen here is that they're committing a verbal genocide they're just they're just disappearing the concept of a woman you're just gonna say you're never gonna see this word ever again because it's offensive to men that think that they're women so we're gonna pretend that there's no differences and it's really disgusting but spencer you bring up a really good point that ultimately what they're doing is that they're reducing women to their bodily autonomy there was once upon a time where the feminists used to fight against that like you know what i mean like we're more than this and now they're saying actually you're just that we're going to reduce you with all of these ridiculous terms you know that really just talk about your private parts all the time right and we don't we no longer have a word for you you're just an understanding of private parts and i don't see how people don't understand that this is peak misogyny this is this is actually what every feminist should be out outraged about we have to understand that all of the craziness we're seeing all the pup self and demon self and these like millions of pronouns and all the weird you know trans minority all of it comes out of this it comes out of this moment in the feminist movement where it turned away from celebrating womanhood and toward making women more like men and in 1990 they start to say well you know what is a woman really you know a woman can be anything a woman can be a robot a woman can be a man that you know pretends to give birth and everything all the madness that we're seeing now is just this desperate attempt to reduce women to a set of body parts that can be sold and exchanged or or produced through surgery right and and the question is why and you think that through which it was something that i wanted to add on my instagram rant later on today probably well but when you this this what you're talking about is encouraging women to be more like men the reason for that also is because there is more state control that way when we talk about the fact that people have to say oh well my kid can't go to school unless i do this you know and you know why is it that you suddenly are so scared about your kid going to public school because they've said to women you need to be at home and working and not raising your kids right we want the state wants to raise your kids they want women to not have an active role in raising their kids they've shamed women for wanting to be stay-at-home moms there's been this sort of effort to shame women that don't want that say hey i just want to stay at home and raise my kids oh no no no no that's that's the patriarchy speaking to you you should want to go to work climb the corporate ladder and this is the result right this is what happens when women are disappeared from society we're seeing the harmful effects on our children on future generations of this country you look at what happened in virginia in loudoun county and in that state in that election and you know you know why they don't want women at home they don't want a woman at home because mom sees mom knows what's going on she has a great eyes in the back of our heads oh yeah yeah exactly everybody knows how to mother knows right and then they take action because they make the world go around i mean mothers literally not only create life but make the world go around and they cannot abide that because the family is the one defense against all of their nonsense that's exactly i can't handle it thanks for joining me on this segment

"Ori-C46whwQ": "we have to get to this headline which is is everyone okay sometimes you see a headline [Music] do you sometimes see headlines and i saw this one over the weekend woman mary's pet cat in bid to stop landlords separating them and thought i just went this is love does win i was just like i always miss scenarios go i wish i could speak to these people well guess what we are actually going to be able to speak to this person she's going to be joining us via skype deborah hodge welcome is that your husband cat hi she's a girl she's a girl what what's her name she says she's called india india i love cats by the way i'm a tremendous cat person so i'm very excited to see this all right you've got to give us the background cause when you see a headline like this you know it just makes me wonder what the heck were you thinking deborah what what's going on in england okay so uh i'm actually standing for prime minister because it's very corrupt over here but the right-wing press won't print a story about me standing for prime minister even though i'm independent and fight for world peace and climate change peter commerce um but that's better than johnson everybody's going wild over my cat my so what what made you decide to um marry your cat well i lost my job recently i was working at a company called fdm for three and a half days and i was a deputy head teacher for like 15 years and i was like oh my god three and a half days what what on earth have i done um it's that bad so i panicked and i sort of sat there in the shop for about four weeks and i was like how am i gonna pay my rent like i literally don't know i'm gonna do it and i was like well what if i have to leave india because i had to re-home two huskies when we moved here and i think it would literally break my oh she's gone it would literally break my heart if i had to re-home another pet so i was like i know uh we'll get married um i married me house before but that didn't work and i married a cardboard cutout of richard branson that didn't work either but hopefully this time third time lucky we'll get back to this important conversation in just a moment but first we have to talk about the economy everywhere you look around you realize that the economy is in dire straits and you're already starting to see those ripple effects in the housing market as people's buying power has completely diminished have you considered what could happen in the stock market if our economy stalls out don't wait until that happens take some of your profits from the stock market now and solidify

night i married uh again we renewed our wedding vows so yeah yeah okay and so now you're saying the landlord can't kick you out because you're married to the pet well it's or do you really love the pack hopefully i'll be able to pay my rent next month um help me um but it's more about if if we have to go to another property she has to come with me it's legally binding or not but can i ask about your outfit at the moment are those are those bats oh my god okay so i just have to do a little shout out that might explain it right so dolly oh who's the naked doll is that your child is your cat no okay no but it's nashville that this is going out and so jolene jolene i'm begging you please don't take my cat you know okay i'm wondering though okay what if you were married to a human and that that person was a violent murderer it wouldn't matter if you were married right like the landlord would still be able to kick that person out right so why does it matter if you're a violent murderer right well i'm not and i'm single so and also if i ever met anyone cat comes first kiss cat bloat it seems to me you you probably broke a lot of hearts when uh when this news came down i mean you've got probably just the line of these guys didn't get my hair as big as dolly but it wasn't working so i'll shove a wiggle oh i'm very in favor of this tactic here because you think if political activists are going to redefine marriage for all sorts of crazy ends this is one of the most wholesome ways to redefine marriage you just get to keep your cat i am i am very much clever all i want to do is keep my cat and spread awareness that there are people in ukraine carrying their dogs and their cats or animals and then you've got people who during lockdown got animals and then they're giving them away because they have to go back to work no all right yeah actually i'm not having that yeah i'm glad that you said that but also you want to be prime minister well i don't want to do it and i actually think that anybody who wants to be prime minister or mayor you were talking about gun crime earlier when anyone wants to do it for a career is somebody wants made do it because they want to change the world for the better no i don't want the attention i don't want to be viral i'd rather live on an island on my own but someone's got to do it and they've got to do it independently i can't be corrupted i can't be bought you know none of that i fight for world peace for the homeless um i fight for equality i've got autism i've fight for neurodiversity my cat's got three legs she's not any less of a cat she's got three legs yeah i totally agree i'm on board you guys aren't worried i think i'm sold all right currently over prime minister deborah thank you thank you very much i like you very much elvis once from nashville was he yeah no close enough i don't know i don't know triggered but anyway deborah thank you so much for taking the time out to join us on the show we had to get to the bottom of the story and we're so happy to have had you good luck on your bid to become prime minister of the united kingdom i just got to say still a better love story than harry and megan

ufc fighters let me just say the man who needs no introduction the president of the ufc welcome thank you white thank you so the the ufc has become one of my favorite pastimes for a lot of a lot of reasons and i do love the dances they do on the way in uh you guys have just exploded over the last few years what do you think it is like what is going on that it's just been like ufc yeah well first of all we're the most exciting live sporting event there is if you've ever been to one it's great on tv fun to watch on tv but it's even better live and uh we've been aggressive in taking this thing everywhere you know when you think about what boxing did over the last 30 or 40 years they do atlantic city madison square garden every once in a while in a lot of vegas we took this thing everywhere every major city in the country uh in the into other parts of the world and uh you know really focused on the live event and getting television deals and i i think that the fact that i had pushed so hard to go through covid um really helped us a lot too right you're so right there is something that is so unique and i can only describe it to people who have not been to a ufc fight but i went to my first fight last year didn't know what to expect and i am telling you when i was sitting on the side of the octagon like there is just i can't even explain the energy that courses through your body like eventually i'm going to have to pay you to get rid of the tape of the things that came out of my mouth when i was like i heard i heard you were going to get up get up destroy him like and i was just going this is not who i am afterwards i was like i don't know what got into me but there is something about it that it's it's almost primal these these these fighters are amazing athletes i don't think people understand they're like machines yeah no they're super talented they're incredible athletes um a lot of their stories are really cool most of these guys went to college and graduate you know they're not stereotypical fighters what you would think an ultimate fighter is they're the exact opposite it's and we saw that early in in the uh in the athletes and in the sport and it's part of what we sell right exactly and actually speaking of incredible stories you actually have an amazing story and and people don't often hear it but you weren't a person that had tons of opportunities in your life and you've turned this into quite the industry can you talk a little bit about your personal background um yeah you know i grew up my family's from boston um my mom was a single mother we moved to uh vegas in um 79 or 78 or 79 in that ballpark because they were my mom was a nurse and they were paying nurses more than anywhere else in the country so that's why we moved to vegas and uh you know i went to school there for a couple years then went and lived with my grandparents in maine and ended up back in boston and when i was uh 18 years old i was a bellman at the boston harbor hotel and uh one day i was standing in the lobby and i was like what the hell am i doing here you know it was good money you know great hotel great place to work great place to stay uh they you know they had all the things that you think you want in life you know i made tips you made good money every day they had a 401k health insurance all those things but i just said this isn't me this isn't what i want and uh i literally walked out the door and quit and uh there was what was that moment that was there a specific thing that happened or just in your head you just said i'm done with this yeah i i always wanted to be i loved fighting and i always wanted to be in the fight business and i'll never forget it as long as i was standing in the lobby one day you know that is your you work at a hotel you got to stand up against the lobby like this wait for pete can i help you with your bags you know that i'm like i literally said what the hell am i doing here why why am i doing this i talk about that so often it's it's almost a mentality switch when you can just kind of say to yourself i don't want to i don't want this for my life anymore right and you did this 100 and i tell people all the time you know people say what's the worst thing that can happen the worst thing that can happen is not trying not trying is the worst thing that can happen if everything failed then none of it worked out you go back to work i mean you can go get a job like that any day of the week um you know and i'm 19 years old at this time and uh you know everybody's telling them what are you going to do what are you going to do i want to get in the fight business you know and then you hear how stupid that is you know it's the dumbest thing anybody's ever heard um but it was what i wanted to do was what i knew that no matter what happened when i got out of bed every day i was going to be happy doing what i you know going to work and doing what i love to do yeah it's interesting now because you see what i'm seeing starting to shift now is that so many so many celebrities attend these you know these these are sitting uh i would say octagon side right octagon side are sitting octagon side and it's sort of becoming a cultural thing it's it's just so interesting to see what you've been able to do with the ufc um and and you definitely deserve all of the success and i have to ask you what are you making right now just talking about a popular thing that people are talking about right now of the jake paul challenging the ufc fighters what is your perspective on all of that well the the thing is in this business is it it's all about showmanship i mean if you look at conor mcgregor and how he exploded the floyd money mayweather and you know what he was able to do and turn himself into you know the the kid's a showman and he's he's calling out ufc people um to get more attention you know the kid's making money and you know can he fight i doubt it i mean if if you look at what he's done this isn't going to last long yeah but he's going to make some money yeah so you think you think it's more of a gimmick it's an absolute gimmick yeah and these these athletes like i said the mma guys they just it's day in and day out it is just such a grind people i don't think people understand what it takes uh you know to be in the octagon and and you know how much of their lives they're giving up just dedicated to this sport day in and day out and it's a life you know it's a lifelong commitment it's not something that you just wake up one day and go i'm just going to jump in jump in the octagon and try to be a fighter you know right so it's it's incredible stuff yeah no these type of athletes are wired different than anybody else you know that they're so different in that these are people that will never sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic to go to work will never sit in a cubicle and listen to somebody telling them when they can go to lunch what time they got to be back to just they're not built that way and uh you know i i've heard throughout my career sometimes i'll i'll hear people say well i'm i feel bad for them that they have to fight for a living i said well that's funny they feel bad for you [Laughter] you have to get up and go to work every day and have some 22 year old kid tell you what to do and what not to do and you know so they're they're just they're different human beings that's why they're fighters i think the ufc in general is different and i wanted to actually point to this moment because it was actually one of my favorite sports moments last year um and you probably barely even remembered it because it probably didn't even hit your register but it meant i think so much people that are watching and i think that it's a big contributing factor to the success of the ufc so i remember uh the fight it was tyrone woodley mm-hmm and versus uh colby covington who's a friend of mine um and i remember watching the two of them just looking so opposite you know one of them you got tyron woodley he comes in he's like black lives matter smile black lives matter and then you've got colby he comes in and he's like mega mega magga you know donald trump supporter like and you know it's like they're all they're talking trash each other like they always talk trash to each other and i remember uh in an interview afterwards there was a journalist that was like trying to bait you sort of into just making a comment or you know picking one side or the other maybe and you completely didn't take the beat and i actually want to throw up the quote that you said you said these guys all have their own causes things their own beliefs we don't muzzle anybody here we let everybody speak their minds i'm not going to play these games with you guys i mean can i just give like an amen to that i can't tell you i can't tell you how refreshing it is because it just i think especially for americans right now it feels like there's just nothing that we can enjoy like we can't just like say now it's just a fight and these are the individuals that are fighting it feels like there always has to be you know a corporate strategy or corporate and we just don't really want to hear it and so it was just it's been a breath of fresh air of the ufc well thank you i appreciate that and i agree with you it's like we live in this world right now where nobody's allowed to have their own opinion you know am i going to let tyron come in and talk about black lives matter am i going to let him talk about mega and somebody everybody has a car these are all grown men and women that fight for us they all have their own beliefs their own politics or whatever it is they can say whatever they want to say you know to a point i mean there's sometimes some things crossed the line but at the end of the day too this is the fight business guess what we say really mean things to each other that's how this works you know what i mean and it seems to be an adrenaline for something so so i can't say something mean to you but i'm gonna punch you in the face tomorrow and i'm gonna try to knock you it seems like unconscious right you say something mean to the other i know and i said it's exciting you know because everyone obviously knows it's not i mean it's not that they're saying it's just it's almost like they're hyping themselves up and they're getting excited and uh it's it it just thank you i think i think for everybody watching this thank you for keeping the ufc apolitical and allowing people to just be individuals well i also believe that that when you watch sports right you're you're tuning in to get away from all the all the crap that's going on in your life whether it's you know personal professional political whatever is going on in the world that's your time when you tune in never once did we talk about covid we didn't talk politics we didn't talk about anything negative that was going on when you come in and you watch two or three hours of our fights you're tuning in for fights you're coming in to watch a sport you want to hear all that crap watch any other channel anything it's on piano walk anywhere it's true and that is so true as well and you know covet 19 of course we understand this is going on but it is so true that there needs to be something that americans people all over the world can turn to that allows them to turn off the noise and the bad news right and and we we have to i think do a better job i think corporations need to do a better job of remembering that the individual opinions of indep people fine they can all have their individual opinions but can we just have can we have some fun can we have some good things that are untouched and and not marred um by what feels like just a political takeover at all times of every day so kudos to you guys you have some fights that are coming up thanks yeah let's see so this saturday i'm leaving here and flying to jacksonville we're going to be the first back with a full arena we sold out in jacksonville thank you if you're watching this guys and you have not yet been paying attention to the ufc i am telling you there's just something about it i didn't know what i was doing was that the fight but i was like i need to be back i want to be back every single time like this is this is a sport for us america we can we can just partake in something turn our brains off and just enjoy uh you know being on the side on the sidelines we sold out in jacksonville we sold out in houston and we sold out in vegas three back-to-back fights 50 000 tickets the all three combined sold in less than five minutes and i think what that means is people are done people are done people are done man they're ready to get back you know i'm going to pack this place you know with people and we're going to put on fights on saturday you know there's going to be that buzz that energy that camaraderie that people feel again about being around 15 000 people just wanna explain something together thanks for joining me on this most important episode of candace i really do believe that this subject matter is so important if you

background before i was with the daily wire i hosted michael knowles on my show uh this is actually about my a previous podcast that i had i mean and he basically said nothing wrong he was just talking about statistics uh pertaining to the lgbtq community and how you know trans people have exploded since this sort of narrative has been pushed upon them kind of going back to um what we were talking about earlier in terms of schools kind of preying on children and confusing them um anyway somebody pulled up that four-year-old clip and terry's razors saw it which was a sponsor um that the daily wire worked with and they said thanks for bringing this up we condemn the views in this video which are inexcusable at odds with our longtime support of the lgbtq plus yeah that's a lie long time support they didn't even have those letters a couple of years ago it was just the lgbt community so that's definitely a lot harry anyways we've ended our relationship with the show and are looking into our sponsorships to prevent any values misalignment going forward and so uh the daily wire hit back and here it's jeremy jeremy's razors and here you guys are we can watch a nice ad for that [Music] do you remember when there were two genders and only one and a half of them had to shave their mustaches oh hi i'm jeremy boring ceo and god king of the daily wire harry's razors used to advertise on our shows they're a great product and we were happy to do it that's before some peon who works for me went and said that boys are boys and girls or girls and that was just too much for harry's they condemned our views views held by millions of americans and virtually every human who's walked the planet until about 15 minutes ago as inexcusable and they dropped their ads from our network because of what they called values misalignment you're damn right our values are misaligned and it's not just harry's either gillette razors used to be the best a man could get then they decided that men are too toxic unless you're the kind of man who teaches his daughter to shave her beard if that makes sense to you keep buying gillette but if you've had enough of the woke  and you're tired of paying companies like harry's and gillette to hate you [Music] and buy my new razor instead behold jeremy's razors yes they're real yes they're fabulous but jeremy you say you're a stealth silver fox with a salt and pepper beard that's the envy of lesser men you're damn right i am and i want to be clear that shaving with the jeremy's razor won't actually make you look more like me could make you look more like this guy though and that's the most homoerotic moment you'll ever get from a jeremy's razor commercial what kind of man shaves with a jeremy's razor i don't know how about cowboys firefighters those guys have shot osama bin laden i mean no none of those guys have ever even heard of a jeremy's razor but imagine how much more manly they'd be if they had [Applause] right now you're probably wondering if this whole thing is a joke sure it is that doesn't mean it isn't real or that it won't be the best shave of your life harry's razors doesn't want your business i do they seem to hate you and i well i can't say that i love you but i don't mean you any specific harm our country's in trouble conservatives are being cancelled by hollywood the media universities and now harry's razors stop giving your money to woke corporations who don't think you deserve their product give it to me instead head over to ihateharris.com and pre-order your founders series razor

intelligence officer of the united states navy and the author of the new book the antifa stories from inside the black bloc welcome jack posovic so i i notoriously i see a tourist news people are so upset about it that i don't follow a lot of people online there's there's the people that do the follow culture you follow me i'll follow you back but i actually use my accounts like i like to actually follow people that i feel like are breaking news and you're one of the maybe 12 people that i follow on twitter because you seem to have an inside track to the biden administration you're breaking a lot of stories on your twitter feed cnn is stealing your stories and pretending that they're original i steal them i retweet them and i give full credit where credit is due how are you breaking so many stories about things that are going on in the biden harris administration so you know basically one thing that i learned in the intel community was that you you know an analyst an officer is only as good as their sources and so i've been able to cultivate you know essentially a source network a subsource network through the administrations through the trump administration actually some of which have uh stayed over because they're career employees as opposed to the political hires and because those people who have been able to kind of keep their heads down and maintain their position that essentially has allowed them to continue to be uh function as you know sort of sources for these tidbits of information that come out and you know when they come out and so when i get something of course you know you have to be very careful about what you're what you're using because you know you don't want to use anything that would potentially break opsec and give away you know the source of the information so you always have to kind of synthesize okay how many people knew this uh how many people are in this circle the decision circle so if you remember the the tj ducklow episode um which actually led to uh alexey mccabend which is you know they were dating alexey with the teen vogue and all that so tj ducklow was the first one and he completely blew up at politico playbook when they were um when they were going to break the story that he was dating somebody from axios and this one at lexington was still at axios and ducklo was originally protected by jensaki and the bite administration even though he said some absolutely and what i would consider i think many would consider sex's comments to uh the political reporter basically when she was asking about you know comment on the story and this keep in mind that joe biden has said if i catch anyone in my administration using this type of language they are going to be out period no question that was like his red line in the sand and so jen saki was the one that came in and to some extent i can understand she wants to you know protect her employee but she was the one really pushing well let's just give him a two-week suspension let's let's you know we don't this is day one you know we're still getting used to it we don't need this and then it was ron clayne the chief of staff who came in and said no no no no this is you know that would be understandable had you not already come out and made that that claim and made that put that red line down that said if you cross this you're done right so now you have the credibility of the administration so they must hate you the administration because you're i'm breaking this in real time and that's kind of one of the amazing things about your fees i feel like you are a true investigative reporter um and and you're breaking so many stories and i want to ask you uh what is the administration like from what you're being told because obviously from the outside it seems like there's a lot of efforts being made to protect joe biden at all costs like they don't really want anybody on the inside it's a lot of ducking and covering and we can't really see him oh copen19 we gotta keep everybody at an arm's length and they're allowed to ask questions he's got a lot of notes what is the sentiment behind the scenes in terms of what you actually can say so it's actually quite interesting because you know i kind of refer to it as team k and team b at this point so you've g you've got team b that's team biden and that's ron klein gensaki then you've got team k that's team kamala and that's pretty much everybody else at this point um so jill biden and kamala harris have this huge shade contest going on between the two of them that a lot a lot of people are picking up on but joe biden jill jill jill right the first lady so when you look at kamala's statement that everybody was scratching their heads about when she said i've never been to europe right and as a response to the border crisis they said why why is she saying that what does it have to do with him that comment was directed at jill biden because jill biden and joe they're on their way to europe they're on their way to the uk for the big g7 summit and they get kamala sent down to guatemala so she was upset so she was very upset and what they're trying to come across as well cnn is even reporting that she was not well received and she just she's always kind of had a nasty attitude but she was particularly nasty on this trip so what they're trying to do now is because they realized that sort of you know the train is coming right so they're thinking how can we throw grease on the tracks how can we throw sand in the machine they're giving kamala harris now these sort of like you know set up to fail kind of topics like we're going to put her in charge of the border and then they also said they're going to put her in charge of federalizing elections so this hr one stuff that's kind of doa because mansion and cinema have already said they're probably not going to go for it but they're giving all of these to her because they want to try to trip her up as much as possible no way but the fact of the matter remains is that joe biden and we've seen his antics at the g7 right people are talking about him on the side even justin trudeau one thing that i was told is that he was making comments we also know he was gossiping about about president trump being two-faced at the g7 while we hear he's gossiping again that he thinks that kamala will be in by the end of 2022. wow justin trudeau thinks that yeah and i think a lot of people probably think that he doesn't seem like he has his mental faculties about him i've heard other people say actually he's kind of always been that he's kind of always not really had his mental faculties about them and people know it um and i can't i wouldn't say that i feel bad for kamala because this is a woman who's still on a stage when she was running for president said joe biden was a racist she was the little girl on the bus remember remember jack she was on the bus and then suddenly she has a total flip-flop because all she really cares about is to be in a position of power so i think it serves her right um that they're diminishing that power and kind of allowing her to make a fool of herself on

expressvpn.com candace you can get an extra three months free on a one year package that's expressvpn.com candice to learn more i do want to talk about your opinion regarding putin because i think this has kind of been one of the most fascinating elements to me is that they keep almost gaslighting america they keep wanting us to focus on russia when it is just so apparent that china is the problem it's like it's like almost like don't look at china look at china they're doing everything but we want you to look at russia and putin kind of came out and really laughed at the assertion that you know joe biden is doing this tough talk but has now twice turned him down in terms of doing any sort of public interfacing or public conversations uh which vladimir putin is obviously uh very willing to do what do you make of joe biden turning down vladimir putin twice despite the tough guy talk well i think it's interesting because you know a lot of people look at the differences between biden and putin but they also actually have a lot in common um that people don't realize so both before they were presidents they were prior to then the second in command so biden was vice president um putin was the deputy prime minister um they also they're both into aviator sunglasses you know we're both super into those and actually with both of them neither one allow you to discuss how it is that they got into office yeah you're not allowed to talk about that in russia so no really the situation though is it really does drive back to china and a situation where joe biden refuses to go after china with the type of vitriol that he uses against putin and so he calls out on putin on a variety of issues cyber crimes or justice and the way they enforce rule of law in russia fine great crimea etc where's his sentiment on china when it comes to the wuhan lab where's that level of vitriol when it comes the way he treats the uyghurs the way they've cracked down on hong kong and the freedom protesters there where's the vitriol and the way that we know that china is becoming closer and closer towards encircling taiwan with artificial islands that they've built and are militarizing on our watch we send our naval vessels you know i was in the navy and we send the vessels by every once in a while and it's like well they're building them and they're getting bigger and they're getting more emplacements on them and yet it's sort of like we pay lip service when it comes to china but when it goes in terms of russia that's you know the main enemy yeah but i wanna i just wanna talk about that a little bit further because there might be people watching this that don't follow foreign policy because there seems to be so many topics of a day and i want to hit on specifically what it is you're talking about in case any listeners aren't aware so china uh seeks to be dominant in the south china sea they believe that they should control the south china sea which has an incredible amount of trade that goes on back there and if you control the south china sea it makes you very powerful so china uh actually built a fake artificial island the spratly islands and they've been building this up for a very long time and this should be something that is being discussed every single day and we don't hear about it anywhere and i know that you have actually been paying attention to this you told me since you were an analyst uh since you were an intelligence officer tell me what that was like as an intelligent officer and what did you see what year was that how long ago was it as an analyst going something is going on here in china that we should pay attention to yeah so you know looking at it's funny of my history with china um i actually first lived in china for two years um starting out as a student then i got a job was i was working at the american chamber of commerce i eventually got a job working in an international business right in shanghai so lived there for about two years uh learned to speak fluent mandarin then joined the navy so i joined the navy 2010 and immediately went into the intel track and my entire focus from the very start was china it was always the ccp and their encroachment not only on uh in terms of their own people but in terms of what they were doing in the region and what they were attempting to do what their goals were worldwide you have a country that's led by this tyrannical regime that has only one thing in mind and that's pulling the united states and the rest of the world down and having china replace them as sort of the world hegemon the world top power and they're looking to do that by 2049 they're very close to doing it and within the country that is very much the raison d'etre of the chinese people as well there are many many chinese people now there's a lot of dissidents as well but there's many people that are totally into this the younger generation is hyper nationalistic because they view the takedowns of the west as the rise of china so and this is called from a foreign policy perspective for those who are watching the belt and road initiatives that they they want the whole west to turn to them for everything and we're seeing so much of that happen now and yet nobody in the west even knows about what we're talking about people are know nothing about china and what they've been doing the average american i kind of wonder what it's going to be that really wakes up america to this and i do think that covet has been a huge step in that direction where people are looking to say what do you mean we can't manufacture masks that aren't made in china what do you mean that we can't get any pharmaceuticals that aren't manufactured from with you know with elements that are sourced from china why is this why is this all in china they seem like important things and then when you look at the whole thing it it still seems though that the elites right the elites in america are still just kind of wanting to go along with all of this because they want the china dream to be the one that blossoms not the american dream so i'm wondering if at this point when you look at belton road they're building now ports on the atlantic coast of western africa right and so those ports are then going to be dual used by the chinese navy so the chinese navy is going to be porting in the atlantic ocean i'm wondering at that point will people say this is too much and we have to do something but the real question is once that belt and road is up is it already going to be too late right and and i totally agree with you and it seems to me if you actually find it you know follow chinese dollars um they are putting a lot of money into america right now whether it's via the education system uh they are sponsoring elements the black lives matter movement um which seems that they it's almost like they want there to be perpetual unrest in america so that nobody's paying attention i mean the audacity um for them to talk about our race issues notoriously um sitting sitting down in on our soil in alaska and talking about america we've got an issue with race is such a joke to them because they think that we're almost too stupid to understand foreign policy and if they just keep talking about race which is what the media is doing if we just keep talking about race nobody will pay attention to what it is that we're doing as we slowly try to what looks like to me take over the world what that diplomat did young dhir and i actually had the ability to meet him back in 2006 when my first visits there when i was still studying this stuff he he turned biden administration's entire narrative back on their heads and back on them they say who are you to talk to us about the uyghurs when you guys are treating black lives matter the way you are you aren't tony blanken and joe biden weren't you the guys who came out and said america is systemically racist nation and so who are you to tell us uh the dictates of international morality on the world stage when you guys have all these problems in fact maybe china's better than the united states so they're they're using our own words against us and the by administration doesn't understand that they can't have one message for a domestic audience and another message for the international audience that's the world is linked now it's 21st century right they are listening to us they hear those sound clips and they're going to use it every single time they get a chance every authoritarian regime around the world is going to do this but they don't care because they've sold out these uh traditional american values for these these sort of new values and of course we talk about crt and all the different things and this is why international liberalism is you know that entire initiative has been problematic and again if people actually looked at what was important and looked at who was funding people think united nations great you know all the organizations under the united nations great they think oh the who this is obviously a body a global body no china is the number one or number two giver to all of these organizations in terms of the finances so they are funding these organizations organizations are not going to speak out against china because they're being controlled by that they they understand our system better than we do at this point i encourage everybody who's listening to discussion to really learn about china learn about the south china sea learn about the belt and road initiative and what china is doing because i promise you china is the threat to us at this moment way more so than russia is thanks for joining me on this episode of candace if you like this video subscribe to this

tokyo olympics of a reporter trying to get these women to comment on laurel hubbard the first trans woman that's competing in the olympics is quite rich look how these women respond to it at the olympics with laurel hubbard competing as the first openly transgender in a in a individual event i was wondering you know what you felt about that and what you felt that it took place in your sport no thank you i just love it i love it you know it's just it's just bizarre land like you watch more like this and it's like i'm so happy these women just go no thank you because it's so clear that they're upset about this they have every right to be so upset about this and yet the media is playing some weird bizarre game like this is progress it's so much progress that now you guys have to compete with grown men right and should you have something nice to say about that don't you have something beautiful to say about the fact that now sports are not fair anymore yeah bizarre and they're just terrified to say anything right right it's like don't break the ice you can't have an opinion you can't be honest you can't be genuine you just stand there with that one person looked like she was wearing a jock mask on her face that mask was ridiculous i you know i i think you're being too generous by saying i didn't like that response at all i understand it i understand that they didn't want to get in the middle of this and also they're they're the medal winners right and they don't wanna they don't want the story to become about this other person who didn't even make it on the stage so i get that but at the same time with this kind of madness it's not gonna go anywhere until just normal people in these situations just speak up and say the normal thing which is the normal thing that we all agree with although few will say is no of course he shouldn't have been there that's a man he doesn't belong on the stage and it was a farce and it was ridiculous that he was there let's get back to talking about us now just something really simple like that i get why people don't want to say it but as long as sane people remain silent then there's no hope yeah i feel i do feel though by saying you know no comment or no thank you you are you're making a very strong statement by what you're not saying especially when they kind of give it to you like a t-ball like what do you think about this amazing thing and then it's like you know what no thank you and also you have to think this is their livelihood right you have seen how vicious i think there is no movement that has been more vicious than the transgender agenda like they will wipe you out say you're not allowed to exist in society say you're bigoted say you're backwards if you do not get on board with something that is obviously a mental disorder right it's obviously a mental disorder and i'm not saying that as an opinion i'm saying it as a matter of i think they recently changed it but actually the dsm of psychiatric disorders said that gender dysphoria is a psychiatric condition and even if you're on twitter and you say the truth as our good friend ali stuckey did over the weekend she got her account suspended put on hold rather because this is what she tweet this is what she tweeted laura hubbard failing at the event does it make his inclusion fair he's still a man and men shouldn't compete against women in weightlifting so an actual woman got silenced right i mean and got silence because she acknowledged that somebody was actually a man that's insanity it's hateful according to twitter how dare you there was the wii spa in los angeles which has become sort of now a central point in this war where there's protests going on there because a man walked into the women's locker room naked displaying his you know equipment to everybody uh and i don't mean like tennis rackets and he and i apologize i accept it we all accept her we have to accept you okay but thank you you know the man walked in and then some woman just a normal woman had enough of it and she came out and she made a fuss about it and um and i think that's what we need that's what we need to start seeing people do and you know ali stuck you there just says a normal thing and of course i guess in a way you sort of need people to just start jumping on the grenades and i know it's easy for me for me to say but i jump in them all the time it's like that's what exactly we're a lot of grenade jumpers here we need i think everyone that's what we need to start doing otherwise we get cowed into into silence i know a lot of women can relate but i do not know anything about cars i simply want mine to work so thank goodness for rockauto.com ordering parts on rockauto.com is so much easier than walking into a store

truck be sure to write candace in the how did you hear about us box so that they know that it was me that sent you there's something tremendously perverted about it what you're talking about now we're seeing so many of the instances where people are pretending that they've got gender issues because they want to be in places they want to do creepy things and you're allowing this to happen because you're like they're obsessed with making us accept this lie this lie that men can be women and that women can be men and it comes at such a special time when everyone keeps telling us to trust the science yeah yes the science seems to be the narrative and yet with this stuff they're like no no no don't believe your lying eyes don't believe what is very clear to you you just have to wake up one day and want it and that's it yeah it's it's complete insanity and i want to send we got to send like a get well soon card to lo laurel laura hubbard because you think it's a dude you know competing for the weightlifting he's going to dominate you know and then he's in the women and then he doesn't even like that's got you got to feel low that that's that's like you know that's just a dude in a dress he's going to crush and then that's wow and i do i do also love these moments it's sort of like when uh megan rapinoe repino when she lost to the 12 year old boys hilarious hey wait they were 14 come on i'm sorry all right there are 14. big difference but it is it's always these things that remind us that biology is real because you do realize we keep saying that it's unfair for women when men grow men compete but we never hear any men complaining that trans women are competing in their sports i wonder why because they're just not i mean trans men are competing in male sports the men don't care because they're not a threat to them in their trophies right the other thing you do never you never see men at the top of their field discovering magically that they have women trapped inside of them it's always it is it's it's always men who like laurel hubbard you know that's interesting because the left they took that example of him failing out of the olympics and they said oh that proves you see that proves our point because that means that look you're you're afraid he was going to steal all the medals and he doesn't even make it so you're uh so you guys are panicking over nothing but this was a guy this is just like this out of shape normal looking dude he looks like a normal 43 year old dude who got off of his couch one day said i'll compete in the olympics why not and uh and but he was able to make it on the stage against the women it's always these guys who you know it's not going to be the guy who is crushing the men and he discovers he's a woman it's always kind of the bottom of the pack and yeah that's an interesting scientific phenomenon i wonder why that is i will accept the sigh i will put this down today throw on the gauntlet i will accept the science that men can be women and women can be men if you find me a biological woman that becomes a trans man just still a biological woman that defeats the men in athletic competitions in the olympics and i will say you know what if if a woman sprinter beats the male sprinter then i will say you've got me i have a feeling it's going to be a long time to never when that happens oh yeah we

really proud of me and i want to say burke sucks but instead of your real stuff [Laughter] that is incredible that is absolutely incredible did you expect it to have the reaction that it did with everybody in the country suddenly watching it and going oh my gosh who is this girl she's amazing i didn't know that would kind of happen though you have no idea you were just saying how you felt yeah what has been the reaction like to your your friends that have seen this and your and your friends parents have they been so proud of you and supportive i i think so yeah yeah are they are you still having play dates with them well we don't really have playdates most of the time because we don't like like set it up and stuff right that's the only reason you don't set it up well i bet they're very inspired because like you said when they were able to have the option they don't want to wear the masks either so i bet they seem that they think that that's very inspiring so now you have been suspended over 40 times is that correct no i've been suspended 38 times 38 times you've been suspended and so are they going to allow you to graduate or i think so because i've been i've been doing

prior to that she had an in-school suspension a day where they wanted to say she was temporarily removed from class versus all suspension that was her third day of discipline she had silent lunch the first day she was made to eat lunch by herself in an office hallway yes where she spent her all day segregation and her in-school suspension the hallway outside the principal's office wow that is unbelievable i mean it's abusive it is right it's absolutely abusive so are they are they going to remove these suspensions from her record have you guys won this is she now back in school she is back in school she was act she was on her 12th three-day suspension when they changed it back to parental opt-out she would have been serving she'd already been issued the 39th day of suspension that she did not have to did not have to serve for suddenly complying with the district's mandate that changed back to parental opt-out they have not mentioned removing these suspensions whatsoever dave actually told me we got a letter a few days into it that they needed a medical note from a doctor because of fiona's excessive absences they were the ones keeping her out of school and they're the ones that are keeping her out of school i was i was looking at second-degree misdemeanor charges if i didn't get her under the care of a license they were going to arrest you that's basically what it said because they're keeping her out of school exactly this is complete insanity and i mean really kudos to you as a parent for taking a stance and realizing that we cannot be complicit in child abuse because you are fearful of a an administration i mean it just doesn't make any sense these people are breaking the law and by the way i totally agree with you fiona they should go to jail what were you gonna say on actually one of those days they my teacher and my principal were standing outside the door and when i came in they said go straight to the office and i didn't get breakfast that day wow oh my god i mean this is so horrible it's bullying it's coming from adults it was bullying absolutely it seems in the beginning fiona would go to class for 45 to 60 minutes the principal would come get her they had discussions on the way to the office about fiona telling her it was against the law i think it's how she said illegal and the principal told her she was just trying to keep her job and doing what she had to do and like that was the accountability there there's zero accountability for any of this fiona what do you hope that all of the children across the nation that are watching this that are similarly forced to wear masks every single day and they don't get any opt out like what do you hope that they learn from watching you be so brave people were both the teachers were bullying you the administration is bullying you they're not giving you breakfast they're making you eat lunch outside and yet you still stood your ground what do you hope they learn from you i hope they learn to stand up for their rights when someone isn't doing the right thing i think they should stand up for the rights wow i totally agree thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you'd like to join the daily wires fight against the biden administration's unconstitutional vaccine mandates head to dailywire.com do not comply and sign our petition today", "ILRvWQzb8a8": "everyone's encouraging me i i sometimes i have to just turn the phone off because i get so many texts of support from everybody wow that's so great i love to hear it well you guys you know we usually do this segment on the show called counterpoint we skipped the counterpoint segment today and i instead wanted to offer the ultimate counterpoint to the inherent harassment that lieutenant kelly and his family face for citing with the truth i think the point of his suspension and doing it so publicly was to humiliate him right so as a counter to the leftist point we are going to publicly celebrate his bravery and in the process hopefully humiliate every person involved in supporting the lie that kelly did anything to dishonor the norfolk community he did not kyle rand house is innocent and so is lieutenant kelly you guys i promise you i was the biggest fan of ricky lake when i was a kid and every time they had a giant check on these talk shows i was like one day i just need to hold the giant check it just feels like it's more money so i started a campaign on give sen go for lieutenant kelly and his family i know they are still fighting this battle legally i don't care honestly what he does with the money i said i want to raise a hundred thousand dollars for him unfortunately that did not happen because you guys at home are amazing instead we raised north of 240 000 didn't know that until this morning and i get to hold a giant check [Applause] guys [Applause] i am living my childhood dream right now and can i just say by the way that this we had to get this printed yesterday and yesterday it was at two hundred and two thousand dollars today this morning last last i checked it was at 240 000 so there's actually even more money that was printed here but this is just printed because i need to hold the giant check thank you julie this is for you stand up this is for you thank you ma'am it will be more than this i mean genuinely i have to say this i am so grateful for our police officers i i can't even imagine especially in today's political climate what it's like knowing that you're fighting for justice and you have an entire political ecosystem um of horrible people that are constantly fighting against you fighting to defund you telling you that you're not allowed to exist unless you side with narratives that are actually lies so this just makes me so happy it's more money than we expected so i mean if you want to buy me something for christmas whatever whatever i'll take it um thank you so much to you for standing up for truth we hope you get reinstated and i hope you sue the city for what they did to you i honestly mean that thank you so much so they can take that congratulations i got the whole vagina awesome thank you so much", "yXfjkYvHnG4": "over time a thousand films in six years is a that's a lot of films yeah um what did you observe in this industry and um before we get to how you got out of it what did you observe and how did it sort of color your opinion about what the porn industry actually is yeah i mean i think um for someone who struggles with watching that content um you you believe the lie that it's it's real because if you watch your favorite you know fight you know fight movie or whatever you see the matrix or something like that you see this fight scene and there's no way that you really think that's how that happened and the the porn industry is very much like that where there's a director there's lots of shooting there's editing there's makeup there's cuts there's two people that don't want to be there and at the end of the day you're laying your head down on a pillow and it doesn't matter how much money you're making or how much travel you're doing you feel terrible about yourself because there's no way that you're proud that you're prostituting yourself right so two people that don't want to be there right so both of the actors or multiple actors that are involved in this you start to realize that they don't really want to be here and i can imagine it's like maybe 10 times 20 times worse for the woman in this scenario who tend to come from very bad backgrounds and are kind of thrust into this industry and yet the people that consume porn and this is something that i've only been i think awoken to in the past i would say four years because tim ballard who runs an organization that's really aimed at sex trafficking talks about how how many how the porn industry and american consumption of the poor industry is actually what feeds the sex trafficking industry right and it just totally made me go wow people that are seeing the final product of what you create are not thinking about the drug addicts we're not thinking about these hopeless young women who feel like this is what they have to do to be able to survive we're not thinking about some women in circumstances where porn is much grittier are actually just being sex trafficked and and their videos are being sold online um did you start to understand that as you as as it went on yeah i mean it it became both monotonous and darker at the same time where um like it was it was what i did for work it was what i did you know 25 to 30 times a month so it just became so arbitrary to me that it didn't like i didn't really think about what i was doing and me as a person i really stopped existing and so it's like i'm seeing these people who are coming on set because for the most part guys that are in the industry it's the same like 25 30 guys that stay in the industry and then there's just a constant you know influx of girls and so you see these girls come in the industry and like some some of them are struggling with this and struggling with that and just you can't help but see depravity regardless of what your worldview is right absolutely um so what was that turning point for you where you went okay actually i don't want to be here i mean six years first let's talk about family back home you know small town south carolina you've gone off and become a big porn star in l.a how's your mom reacting to that how are your family and friends reacting to that yeah i mean it was like humiliation you know like i i embarrassed my mom um so like for me um i started isolating myself very quickly from my friends and family because of shame and guilt you know very like genesis 2 to genesis 3 it's like adam and eve were walking they were naked there was no shame all of a sudden they were sin they were hiding from god and then for me it's like me hiding from the people that really knew me because if you really knew me i was accountable to you so the people that really had value my life i felt ashamed and i felt guilty so i start i stopped answering my mom's phone calls her text so then the first initial conversation was was not you know i i'm i'm disowning you it was i love you and i know that there's so much more value in you than that and that never changed she never stopped saying that she loved me she never stopped pursuing me but my view of myself caused me to dis distant myself from her it was like a defense mechanism yeah this this woman actually sees me for what i am yeah in order for me to get up every day and do what i need to do yeah i need to push mom out yeah absolutely and and that's the case for so many people who are still in the industry because you believe the live you are what you do and because of what you've done you see the rest of your life is well um i've already done that this is my value this is what i can offer this is who i am you know the big lie that many people say this is just who i am is such a terrible lie from the very pit of hell and it's going to lead you to death it's so interesting you say that because you know obviously i'm much more everything is politics so i say i'm in the political space but everything actually is root politics and talking about that idea that people can't change is something that is is very important to continually have this conversation about because as we now get into this society that won't even let children evolve from a tweet that they sent when they were 12 years old like this is who you are you said something racist when you're 12 and therefore you are racist forever and you see that we have these rates of people jumping teenage suicide is jumping it's getting younger and younger 11 year olds you know committing suicide because they did something embarrassing on snapchat and it went around the school and this culture that's actually being perpetuated by the journalists the media they're saying yes look what i found this person did 10 years ago like you're not allowed to evolve and i always say that what a death that is upon the individual what a depth sentence that is to an individual's soul to say you can't change your mind you can't change your perspective you can't change who you are that's a very scary dark i like what you said pit of hell because that's that's putting an individual in a pit of hell um and obviously your story proves that you saw something else so you said actually no i can change yeah what was the moment yeah i mean just just a caveat on like what you just said like the reality is there's 30 women who were in the industry the same time as me so i'm in my 30s there should they should be in their 30s but 30 people have took they've taken their own life due to either overdose or suicide and it's because they believe that lie that you just said it will always be this i'll always and everyone in their circle of influence is telling them that 30 people 30 people and the the terrible thing candace is that those videos are still online being consumed at an astronomical rate wow and and then the industry they flex on that they they point people in that direction it's like you know the best of this person the best of that and they monopolize on that person's debt wow but um i'm sorry i don't know that's so sad that's that's so sad because it's it's it's you know it's beyond the porn industry you're serious over and over again that people are being taught that they can't evolve and they can't change their minds and people mock the idea of even i mean even someone like me i wasn't in the porn industry but it's like you used to think more liberally right you're not allowed to be a conservative excuse me i was 16 years old i'm not allowed to evolve from the ideas from when i'm six of course i can evolve yeah you know and it's an important conversation to have so i'm glad you told me that because that's really interesting to hear that yeah absolutely i mean that's the truth is today regardless of what your life looks like and what you've done you can choose to move into a different direction you can choose to you know create a different version of yourself a better version of yourself based on truth right right and and sometimes having made the bad decision is what makes the next step even greater because you understand it you understand the depravity so i have to imagine as a pastor now as you're talking about sin and you're talking about that transformation it has a deeper meaning for you because you've been in those dark places you know what it means to be without your family you know what it means you know when the devil has taken over an aspect of your life

right we got more lockdowns we need to be triple masked you know we need to be forced back seeing everybody until she wanted to have some fun on new year's eve and she was like oh let me go to a free state of florida obviously and have a good time and somebody catches her with her boyfriend with some questionable sandals sandals on and people begin tweeting you know because this is hypocritical and the sandals are ugly people want to know what's going on and of course that is the definition of white privilege that is what white privilege looks like going out in public looking like that right exactly you have to just enjoy this and so she responds to this obvious like attack calling her hypocritical because it is hypocritical if republicans are mad they can't date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend's feet yeah creepy weirdos and then she went on in another tweet and said it's starting to get old ignoring the very obvious strange and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the republican fixation on me blah blah blah blah all i know is if anybody disagrees with me this year i'm going to say you want to have sex with me and that's the only reason i disagree with me and this is this is the new way this is the new defense right and defense it's so bizarre because first of all the birkenstocks are weird those are by the way for those who don't know he's wearing birkenstocks so that's the first weird thing about this but i think it's really interesting that she's completely just like taking that saying that people want to have sex with her i mean newsflash we're republicans we don't want to have sex with aoc right now seriously it's so childish aoc marxist antoinette right the peasants in your district are starving and they have no covet test let them drink cake martinis right let them drink the cake martini come down to florida florida has a very proud tradition of accepting communists who destroyed their homeland and have to go to florida for refuge it's just normally they came on a raft and not a first class ticket and normally they're very thankful when they get there not trying to dunk on the governor who by the way she sent a venomous tweet about ron desantis who is comforting his wife going through breast cancer treatment in tampa florida he has three children he has a one-year-old you know what that's like candace i know what that's like it's a handful maybe if aoc had children right uh she would understand this she's not having children because climate change she's on the one child policy i think she's not having children because her husband looks like that but that's just the point what i'm saying i love you mean it uh what i'm what i mean is how dare you right how dare you you are a communist who has destroyed new york's 14th district your policies have wrecked this district it is currently uh under incredible siege from covid and crime and defunded police and all the horrors going on in new york city have you been back to new york it is a hellscape and then you have the audacity to come down to florida and attack our governor as a communist such ungratefulness shame on you we'll get right back to the show in just a minute but first i wanted to take a moment to wish you all a happy new year one of my resolutions is to continue to prioritize family time around dinner

rich goes to the met gala and gets dressed and has a team of photographers following her you know locked down forever goes down to florida and is taking shots there's a video i think we have a six second video of her partying with drag queens she loves in florida she absolutely does not like she means nothing that she says and yet you still have people cheering her on i mean look at this [Applause] it's just hypocrisy is is her name you know what i mean i mean she was initially though i think that there's actual footage of her she was scouted for that position justice for democrats came in they ran her and then they ultimately have her basically pirating their policies justice for democrats to my understanding has heavy funding from george soros so you look at what they're doing the communist goals and objectives were to infiltrate the democrat party you have it right here with their policies and honestly it's going to be really important in 2022 that we can elect people that can fight the identity politics that they're putting out right you're absolutely in this i'm sorry can i end this by just saying thank you to aoc yeah i've been thinking about it here over the last 10 seconds thank you what an incredibly powerful thing she's given all of us you just want to date me anyone can say that now i know right oh you're attacking me ted cruz oh you're attacking me right like oh you ben shapiro you just want to date me right they already accused ben shapiro wong indeed her she's this is like her thing it's just her stick like it's just like you you want to have sex

to be speaking with you and i said what do you think about the climate change climate change and she said the earth is on fire and we're all going to die soon and i asked her how that made her feel and she said it made her feel angry what should i tell my daughter and how should i help her and the youngest generation bear the emotional toll of the actions that we're taking fossil fuel companies are taking to destroy our planet it would be strange if we didn't feel that way because then we wouldn't have any empathy the democrat politicians always seem to have a conversation with their kids about every single time remember how am i going to explain to my daughter that hillary clinton didn't win just tell her she wouldn't go make your bet you know i mean like my seven-year-old came to me and said i'm afraid that the world is on fire and we're all going to die i'd be like that's because you're a child and you're stupid because that's not true", "2WS1FR47hh4": "i was very surprised to find out that you made cowboy boots it was just so ironic the way that it all went down but i will say i shouldn't have been that surprised because you are quite the entrepreneur in fact you once won celebrity apprentice i did it was totally fantastic incredible good people good people i had no idea i was hanging out with the future president united states crazy and what was that like how okay what was he like before he was the president of the united states you know he's got a real uh personality he likes he likes to poke at you and jab he's like hey where'd you get those boots yeah you know he'll make like a comment you're like i don't know what i'm supposed to say right now because you're the boss you know what but but he was you know one of the i think one of the coolest things i ever saw him do that i'm the only one that saw it was we were riding on an elevator together in trump tower it was him and melania and me we're coming down probably 60 floors there's an elevator attendant standing there this this older older gentleman and uh mr trump goes puts his hand on his shoulder the guy turns around he goes do you enjoy working here and he said yes sir and he goes are people treating you well here at trump tower he goes yes sir and he goes well keep up the great work we couldn't do it without you and pat the guy on the back and the guy just kind of stood up you know and you could see some pride there and i went you know he cares about people i think that's the one thing i picked up on is he cares about people i don't think he would have run for president if he didn't care about people because he got the tar beat out of him the entire time was terrible for his business so why did he do it right because he cares about people and americans and wanted wanted to see better things happen for him so let me ask you how strange is it for you to realize that the media has that much power so you know this guy at a time when the media says this guy's great he's amazing all the rappers talked about him decades you know decades of a show put him here we love him we love him and then suddenly the media goes okay never mind never mind this guy's a horrible backwards bigot racist it's white supremacist you can't like him at all like what is that like as someone who knew him at both times well first of all are you trying to say the media is hypocritical it's just because come on uh you know i think when he you know went to a spot where he wasn't serving their purpose anymore they turn on you they'll turn on anybody they'll turn on their own they'll turn on whoever if it's not fit in their narrative or their plan whatever it is but i mean it took a tough guy like him who'd been through a lot of tough situations in his business and otherwise to take them on and go well call me whatever you want i know we need to do this and i know we need to do that and you know now you see a lot of people that voted for biden that are already having buyers remorse because they see their gas prices going up and they see the tax bills that are coming they see sheila jackson leaves a gun bill that's coming at him and biden's saying hey maybe i'll just do an executive action on guns well i hate to tell you there's a lot of democrats that own guns too and they put gas in their car too and they pay taxes too you know so i think there's a lot of buyers remorse they're going you know what you know i would trade some mean tweets right now you know to have his policies back in place yeah you know the things he did mattered they helped people a lot of people's lives become better that's why you saw the border on texas you know all those all those counties down there that were always blue counties go red you know i'm from texas so the hispanic people in texas were voting in droves for trump i think that blew the mind of the left when they saw that happen right and it maybe made them feel like they were out of control because the media was so insistent on a narrative and yet people are becoming less and less responsive to that narrative because they realize how vicious the media can be especially in the midst of cancer culture and i want to talk to you a little bit about the country music scene because i've noticed this thing there they cancelled morgan wallen who's a wonderful artist twice in the same year i think the first time it was because he didn't wear a mask somewhere so oh my god he's breathing he's got to be canceled and the second time it was something more serious he called a white friend of his the n-word he came out he apologized as you should have done but people say you know that's not acceptable we don't accept apologies around here and actually they then started going to everybody else in the country music world and saying you must make apologize and everybody must come out and declare that they're not racist and it just seemed so ridiculous to me and you really had country music stars coming out and saying i'm sorry for that video that i shot 20 years ago that had a confederate flag on the back of a pickup truck ew ew i just was like what is this what do you make of that are there real racist absolutely i've thrown some of them uh out of back stages before for saying saying things that i said would you say that around cowboy troy and they go uh well i was just kidding it ain't a joke to me get out right absolutely and i think that what's most important is to everybody who feels like they have to apologize you should only apologize if you've done something wrong right and you shouldn't make an apology because the media demands it and and that's i think it's happening a bit too much right now look at the mumford and sons you know him ridiculous what they're being you know like reading a book he's he's running away and retreating from something that he's being accused of that he didn't that he did not do or it's not he's not guilty of something that they're that they're accusing him of so in effect they can fabricate a crime a crime and so then it's up to the person that's being accused of that to either accept it and go please please please or go no i reject that i reject that accusation that is not me now if that's true about you if you really are a nazi or you really are a racist or some of the bad words they use if you're really those things all right then that's a different story but if you know in your heart that is not me i'm not that person and they levy those attacks against you you got to get a backbone and push back against it because that's the only way we're going to be able to right this ship otherwise it's just a steamroller going on and people that don't have uh feelings like that about other people they just get accused of it get run out there's a word for that you know what it's called fascism you know and so they say no we're anti-fascists and we know how that game plays we just say we're the opposite of what we actually are yeah but we all know that trick now so absolutely not giving you social justice warriors you're not guilty of what they're accusing you of reject it and push back against it i say the same thing don't apologize to the left because once you start apologizing you'll never stop apologizing uh because the social justice warriors simply want capitulation thanks for joining me on this segment of candace

expressvpn don't like big tech and the government spying on you visit expressvpn.com candace i want to switch topics here though and talk about jack dorsey who is stepping down as from the ceo role at twitter what are your thoughts i think it went from like bad to worse like there's no in between we thought twitter couldn't get any worse hopefully they just get cancelled and and they tank their stocks but it's it's pretty bad i mean twitter's never been you know favorable to conservatives but i think now it's in your face like we're probably all going to get cancelled so just follow us on getter yeah he's being replaced by parag agrawal and here's a sample tweet from the new ceo of twitter if they are not going to make a distinction between muslims and extremists then why should i distinguish between white people and racists awesome so glad you're gonna be heading up twitter prague i think that's gonna be a really fun time what were you thinking when you saw this it's it's petrifying because social media is the modern public square and the power to censor social media is the power to shape ideas and the power to de-platform remove people that you disagree with on social media is effectively silencing their voices that's why i believe that we should be regulating them just like you utility companies you know telephone companies can't just censor people or remove people that's how we should be treating social media platforms i absolutely agree i heard a statement recently it said that some of these tech companies are more powerful than any king in the history of the world and it's true they are influencing government and certain governments that are smart ones at least they're actually banning platforms like twitter because of the amount of propaganda that was actually coming from our own you know american born companies but i think that if we don't get ahead of this or at least have something that can create a competitive platform i think that our country is honestly screwed because we need it they're silencing our voices and you know we are making somewhat of an impact but what about the younger generation that only consumes information from social media right i think it's actually a bad thing that jack dorsey has stepped away like i have told a few people this but i actually met jack dorsey a few years ago and i think that conservatives have gotten him wrong um i kanye west introduced me to him i went to dinner with him a few times jack dorsey is not this character that the media has turned to that i think conservatives have turned him into because he never speaks and they kind of turned him to like this like dark lord and the truth is that he's just like a very shy techy kid um who does not have control of his own company he was a hostage at his own company he did not start twitter because he wanted to aid communists at all but am he is somebody that started twitter didn't really know how to run a business got taken advantage of and literally became a hostile zone company i remember him actually saying to me like you know we're in san francisco when we hire people we're not asking what their policies are what do you think their politics are when they're coming through the door um and the company is it's a massive campus like i went i went to the campus it's like a college campus right so you can't imagine when you go twitter took this down that's jack dorsey that's pressing that button that takes it down um so i actually always felt a little bit bad for him and a little bit pathetic for him and i'm happy he's moving on i think he'll do better things in the tech space and with a more informed approach of the world that we're in um that said join parlor my husband's the ceo of parlor uh yes thank you we got involved with carla you guys remember parlor was blowing up and then january 6 happened and apple and google colluded and took them out and completely platformed them and after that my husband and i contacted the people that were behind it and said how can we help and so when it didn't seem like it was ever going to be able to be saved we got involved and it's actually a great platform now it's finally working quickly or they're back on apple hopefully they'll be back on google shortly as well google play store as well but yeah we have to start using alternative platforms there's no question about that because um we just can't keep giving these people this much power you know exactly we will get back to the show in just a moment but first let's talk about your internet security using the internet without expressvpn is like taking a call on a train or bus on speaker for everyone to hear do you want the whole train to know all about your personal business why do you need a vpn well the big internet service providers that we all use track every single website you visit isps can then sell this information to ad companies and tech giants who then use your data to target you so what makes expressvpn so special first expressvpn reroutes your network data through a secure encrypted tunnel so your isb can't see or sell your online activity second expressvpn is so simple to use just fire up the app and click one button that's it it works on phones laptops even routers so everyone who shares your wi-fi can be protected finally express vpn is rated number one by cnet and tech raider i use expressvpn and i love knowing that when i get online my data and my family's data is protected protect your online privacy by visiting expressvpn.com candice today that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com candace you can get three extra months free hunter biden he's kind of the gift that keeps on giving um he really is the email shows that hunter biden was offered 10 million dollars annually by chinese energy firm for introductions alone 10 million dollars and of course we all knew this from the laptop ages ago when his father was running for president the media the mockingbirds they completely buried the story twitter was also implicit in in i'm complicit in burying that story saying that it couldn't be confirmed so therefore you couldn't say it i mean what now i mean the ccp state-owned companies are literally using hunter biden as a front man to funnel cash into this into the into the biden family to then get u.s contracts while biden was vice president that is he is completely compromised and now they they have him in in the highest office of the land so it's a petrifying situation that we're in especially given that we're in a pandemic that was released on by the chinese government so it's a it's a pretty scary situation i mean can we you are the company that you keep china is literally they have people in concentration camps they practice organ harvesting there was a very famous chinese athlete that recently went missing because she accused and actually i guess there was evidence of literally sexual assault on a high-ranking ccp remember she disappears i mean this country is so sick their entire everything that they stand for is against our very foundation and principles of what we are in the united states and we have a president a president that has sold our country down and his family is making millions and these corrupt people in washington dc are sitting there making money not giving a damn about what happens to the american people and we're promoting a country that wants to see us burn i mean if we don't do something soon if we don't start calling a spade a spade we will lose this country we have to fight

who is a tenured professor at rutgers university in the department of women's gender and sexuality studies brittany recently participated in an online conference titled unpacking the attacks on critical race theory hosted by the root let's have a listen the real sort of issue here you know i've heard people sort of say it is one i think that white people viscerally fear it's not that white people don't know right what they have done they know they fear that there is no other way to be human but the way in which they are human which is to so you know like you talk to white people and whenever you really want to have a reckoning about it they say stuff like you know it's just human nature if y'all had all of this power you would have done the same thing right and it's like no that's what white humans did white human beings thought there's a world here and we own it prior to them black and brown people have been sailing across oceans interacting with each other for centuries without total subjugation domination and colonialism let's pause there first and and let me just offer this first counter actually i don't even know if it's a point i think actually after watching that i have more questions than answers first and foremost out of curiosity what white person said to you that it's just human nature if you all had all this power you'd have done the same thing i really feel that you made that up when you inquired about historic oppression a white person said that to you my guess is that no white person anywhere ever at any time or place throughout history has ever uttered those words that to me sounds like a made-up narrative a made-up narrative followed up by another made-up narrative by the way i'm sorry but black people were sailing oceans interacting with each other for centuries before white people because i'm pretty sure sailing across oceans was a european accomplishment christopher columbus was the first to sail the atlantic he was an italian commissioned by spain to sail to the new world the first to sail the pacific was ferdinand magellan from portugal also commissioned by spain so when exactly in your history book the one that you are making up right now as you go along did a black person make that trip centuries prior give me the person's name you know what you are professor cooper you are living proof that we need to maybe stop tearing down those statues not because as churchill said the saying goes those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it but because as i like to say those who don't learn history are doomed to sound like an idiot we will continue the show in just a second but first we need to discuss protecting your retirement it was recently announced that social security benefits are

you there continue but i do think that all of us can sort of agree that our politics that says like there are superior and inferior human beings just isn't the way to go and that's the thing that white people don't trust us to do because they are so corrupt you know their thinking is so morally and spiritually bankrupt about power that they can't let you know they fear viscerally existentially letting go of power because they cannot imagine that there is another way to be it is either that you dominate or you are dominated and isn't it sad that that that is spiritually who they are and that they can't imagine a sort of more expansive notion of the world the thing i want to say to you is we gotta take these [\u00a0__\u00a0] out wow well okay counterpoint number two i i thought we were off to a good start there when you said that a politics that says there are there are superior and inferior human beings just isn't the way to go yeah i agree with that but unfortunately you just you kept speaking you just kept right ongoing you suggest that white people should have zero fear and fully trust in what will happen to them when they let go of power because when black people are given power in this society things are just going to be okay and uh then you oops accidentally said what you really wanted to say which is that we have to take these mother efforts down honestly i aspire to that level of zero self-awareness that you just had there that can't be easy it's not that easy to prove yourself to be an absolute hypocrite in just a few short sentences cheers to you britt but on behalf of the people everywhere who see right through this facade allow me to just say i do not care what race you are if you believe that on the basis of people's skin color they should be given more or less power if you believe that all white people are the same as described by you therefore corrupt morally and spiritually bankrupt if what you really want to say is that an entire race of individuals which span across seven consonants by the way need to be taken down then you belong in zero positions of power anywhere you and i'm speaking directly to you here brit you have ideas that should

some restrictions apply see site for details but please please professor don't let us stop you there keep it going all things that begin end white folks are not infinite and eternal right they ain't gonna go on for infinity and infinity and that's super important to remember that white colonialism and imperialism has a beginning and in my way of thinking about the world that means it has an end and so part of what we are trying to do is to imagine what it what other steps that we must take to get to the other side of this very inconvenient you know epochal interruption of like black and indigenous world making all right let let me try this actually your way ready black folks are not infinite and eternal they ain't gonna just go on for infinity and infinity and that's super important to remember blackness is going to have an end date because despite what they think of themselves they do not defy the laws of eternity how do those statements sound to you professor cooper when i switch the words white and black do they sound racist do they does it sound to you like there are words that must have been spoken from a ku klux klansman a white supremacist a mentally disturbed individual that is suggesting the genocide of an entire race is that the kind of individual that should be allowed on college campuses to teach young students if the fact that you struggle to speak proper english sentences was not indication enough the fact that you are ranting like a racist maniac should signal to rutgers that you are not fit for teaching and you should be removed from any institution where young people with impressionable minds exist but you're tenured right you're a tenured professor which according to you and your very own tweets means that you know that you cannot be fired and therefore you can say whatever it is that you want to say because there's going to be entirely no consequences and guess what you're probably right and for that reason you are yourself the final counterpoint a counterpoint to the current american education system because when any school does not have within its own power the ability to fire an openly genocidal deranged professor and that system is broken it's time to fix it america thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you like this video subscribe to this youtube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on

speeding all right let's get started it's interesting because i think the one thing that the media has been successful at it is definitely creating the caricature of candace and that caricature is an angry bitter upset always yelling person and that could not be further from the truth and i think with this show you're going to get the truth you're going to get all of the other sides of me [Applause] i think one of the most frustrating lies to contend with is this idea that i grew up as a privileged girl in connecticut people here connecticut and they think that you're wealthy and you're rich and it couldn't be further from the truth you know my life started in a very small roach infested apartment sharing one bedroom with my two sisters and i have had to fight for everything that i have and it's because i fought and because i've won that i know that pact within conservatism are the lessons that everybody needs to learn it's about individualism it's about hard work and my life story is exactly that sort of a tale it's funny because one of the things that people who work with me are always so surprised to find out is that i have a sense of humor and that really tells you how good the media has been at creating this candace caricature because my sense of humor is probably the biggest piece of my personality i can't imagine getting through life without having a sense of humor and i think in this day and age people take themselves too seriously i'm constantly having fun i'm always laughing and i'm incredibly happy and i definitely want to inspire the same in my audiences [Music] in terms of politics and being a public figure i started on youtube i'm the youtube american dream i i really just one day uploaded a video it was actually a skit which is why people that have followed my career the longest they know that humor has always been my way to communicate message and i think it was by my third youtube video it went trending worldwide and got 26 million views that was really it everything changed in a moment on youtube next day i was getting calls from networks to come onto tv and it has felt like one big rocket ship since everybody knows this and i've said it so many times but my grandfather is the person that has influenced me the most in my life he is my hero i think he is the coolest person in the entire world and blessed to still have him and i think it's really because of the things that he lived through that i could never not take the opportunities that his life provided me and to see myself as a victim it would definitely feel so fraudulent especially knowing all the things that he lived through so i'm i'm granddad's biggest fan another thing that people don't know about me which i find to be hilarious is that i have two sisters and we are all a year and a half apart and i find that to be hilarious because i guess i must come across like an only child on my my social media channels i guess i must seem like i know i've never heard the word no when actually i'm in the middle so i really never heard the word yes and we grew up fighting we were scrappy little girls we were always fighting hitting each other making fun of each other so i always say my sisters were my first bullies in life so you're going to be hard-pressed to find a comment on instagram or youtube that's going to upset me i've probably already heard it and it probably came from my sisters i feel like i've had so many look mom i made it moments but um i would say probably a moment that i will never forget would be the moment when of course kanye west tweeted i love the way canis owens thinks and the reason that moment was so big is not just because of his celebrity but because of what he meant to me growing up his music and his lyrics was such a part of me feeling like i could be something else that i didn't have to conform because he is one artist who has never conformed to expectations of him but i just see him as someone who is audacious and daring to be different and that's who i've always been so that moment to me was like oh my gosh you know when when your idols start saying that they like you it is a it's a trippy moment you know kanye and i we had two different times in our friendship the first time was when it sort of blew up in the media and i guess i just wasn't prepared to have a friend at that level where people are actively seeking to make sure this friendship doesn't happen and you know i think today we've sort of landed on the side where i've realized that not just with kanye but with a lot of other celebrities that it's best to just keep your friendships private connie and i are cool he's great and i i still view his friendship his mentorship in his music as a blessing one of the biggest rumors out there about me that drives me crazy is that i used to be a democrat and then i just flipped monday and was like okay i'm going to be republican because this is where the money's at couldn't be found from the truth i have never been registered as a democrat i have never voted for a democrat politician in my life what i have said which is true to my story is i used to be a liberal so liberal is an ideology so when i was younger i was woker i kind of you know fell for the feminism thing when i was young which is natural i think there's that old expression that if you're not a liberal when you're young you don't have a heart if you're not conservative when you're older you don't have a brain i have a brain [Music] areas of politics that i probably am caring about more and more is definitely those that are impacting children obviously i am a new mom first time mom and i've always cared about this because i think that once upon a time we sort of left the kids out of it and now it seems that the threshold is getting younger and younger and younger we are going after kids that are in kindergarten confusing them about topics like gender and all this is of course because they're trying to sort of force these leftist ideologies on them as soon as possible i think right now i'm probably the most passionate about the education system because they are not educating they are indoctrinating yeah that is hard it's hard to just say this was the number one highlight throughout my political career because there are so many and for different reasons like i don't think i'll ever forget of course holding my book my book that i wrote in my hand especially because it was such a fight to do it because the publishers just had a different idea of what the book should look like and what the book should say and i've really had to fight for every inch of my brand to stay authentic to who candace is so when i was able to walk into a bookstore i'll never forget at howard university and and i purchased my book at the counter i thought wow this is such a big deal because one time i was a little girl i always said that what i wanted to be was a published author and to be not only a published author but to be so when so many people told me that i wasn't allowed to have a voice and to make it to the new york times bestseller list and to hold that spot for weeks on end that was really cool but you know also uh blexit the black exit movement my five and one two three not for profit the first time we sold out in that event and i looked across the audience and there were minorities in the room listening to conservative principles talking about father absence and being excited and a moment when somebody comes up to a black american and they say and to me this is the most meaningful sentence that finding me made made them feel like they got their life back and that doesn't resonate with everybody and it really resonates with black americans who were caught under a liberal prison a liberal ideology that really imprisoned you because all you're allowed to be is a victim when people say that to me i feel in my heart because that's how i felt when i first realized i was a conservative i suddenly felt like a bird being released out of a cage and didn't even know that they had wings and i guess that's a a really cheesy analogy but that's how it feels so i whenever someone says that to me i just i feel it so in my heart um and those moments matter and of course there's the you know the glamorized moments i mean standing in the oval office trippy you never thought you could make it there by telling the truth and being true to who you are like how freeing is that i got here i'm standing here in the audience with the president of the united states because i had the audacity to be me that's that's pretty cool i think realizing i was a conservative uh was a process i didn't really assign those attributes that my grandparents has to a certain ideology this is conservatism or this is liberalism i never sat down and really thought about what i believed in i was very close with my grandmother she was a mother to me and when she died i sort of just recalled all the things that she had said to me in the end about just being really concerned about me and that was when i was more liberal and sort of chasing the liberal highs as i like to say and it sort of tethered me um to a moment of saying who do i want to be what would make my grandmother proud and i realized that all the lessons that her my grandfather taught me growing up they meant something you know family having faith working hard i mean these were really simple principles that were getting lost so i remember sort of since 2013 sort of questioning things and then there's no question that the media definitely was the catalyst in 2015 watching them attack donald trump who at the time i did not support i did not want donald j trump to be president and then listening to the media say that he was a racist sexist misogynist just made me pause for a second and ask myself wait a second isn't this the same guy that was on tv all the time he's the guy that says you're fired i didn't think in 2015 that he was equipped to be the president but i never thought he was a racist or a sexist or a misogynist and i think in that moment i asked myself is it possible that racism is actually now being used as a theme to strap black americans to a certain existence and when i really thought about it i knew the answer was yes and that somebody needed to break the mold and i thought why not me why can't i be somebody i think probably the ironic part is that we live in a time where the media is constantly saying we need to elevate black voices we need to elevate the voices of women black women need to be heard unless that woman is candace i think it frustrates them tremendously that i'm still here and that i'm not going anywhere maybe the best way to say it is that candace is uncancelable oh gosh when people ask me where i see myself five ten years down the road i'm like witch road if you had told me that i would be a tennessee resident last year i would have said you were crazy if you had told me five years ago that i would be leading a conservative movement i would have told you that you were crazy if you had told me that i would get on a plane and fly to london meet my husband and get engaged two weeks later i would tell you that you were crazy so i'm done guessing i'm done trying to predict what comes next and i've just accepted one foot in front of the other and it's all a part of god's design", "gMkzNLGIPbI": "and for our last question we have someone actually in the audience so I will turn and hello hello what is your name Stephanie Stephanie I heard it's your birthday it is happy birthday Stephanie thank you so much thank you for spending it with me I hope I hope it was a good birthday it was a good birthday present for sure okay I'll let you get to your question all right my question is those of us old enough to remember where we were on 9 11 and the graphic images that will stay in our minds forever remember how United America was after we were attacked it seems Americans are at constant war with each other in recent years do you think we will ever feel United again and what do you think it will take for us to be United that is a great question and I hit on it earlier that I think the reason why it was so different then was because technology was different and all we had were our TV screens and all of the TV screens uh during that time were projecting the same message one of togetherness one of Love uh did it matter race color creed religion it was you are here in America if you're an American We Stand United behind the flag now we have a much larger media it's not just uh the media on your television but it's also what's coming in through your phones um as well as an education system which is projecting the exact opposite message which is that we are all separate we are all different America is a backwards ineffective country that needs to be torn down and start from the beginning uh and and honestly that is what is having such an impact obviously if people are learning to be separate learning to be different learning to judge one another based on the color of their skin whether that means you're white and therefore privileged or you're black and therefore oppressed there's no way this country is going to come together so what I would posit as a solution um would be to remove the powers from the mainstream media Stop Believing everything you see on TV and as I say in every episode parents pull your children back at home because these education systems the education system Department of Education is an absolute disaster which should be abolished is purposefully sending down a message that is ruining our children and ruining future generations of America so that would be my answer my

Modern Art is really really bad it's awful actually it's not art at all what it really is is a tremendous effort from journalists to convince you that dogs food that's really what's happened now so for as one just one example the Guggenheim Museum in New York City Once featured a porcelain urinal yeah how's that for our imagine you're walking around the museum and you see a porcelain urinal now you'd expect reasonably that any honest person would write an article about that and say this is bad this is awful what is happening to Art but no leave it to journalists this is actually a quotation from daily art magazine about that porcelain urinal it says quote he will be pleasantly surprised how a toilet can literally have a deep meaning it literally cannot but it doesn't matter because journalists are just saying stuff nowadays they just say stuff and they tell you basically not to believe your own eyes trust us don't believe your own eyes don't believe your own ears we will tell you what's good and what is bad and typically what we're trying to explain to you is that bad is good which brings me to music that seems to be something that journalists are constantly trying to convince us is worthy when we know that it's not I talk often about cardi B but there are some other artists that we should discuss and I I describe these artists as too big to fail you know the banks were too big to fail in 08 and they're like oh it's okay we're just going to pretend everything's fine but it wasn't fine at all well there are certain artists who started and they were tremendously talented and then they got so big that no matter what they do or what they produce all the journalists tell you it's amazing one such artist is Beyonce Beyonce recently dropped her seven studio album it was called entitled Renaissance and it was anything but a Renaissance it was horrible it was a bad album if you don't believe me all you had to do was check the comments of any individual who heard her album on Twitter the whole Community black community said this is just not her best work it's not good but it doesn't matter because the journalists have to do their job and tell you that it's Beyonce and everything she does turns into sprinkles and rainbows and shame on you if you don't see that this is a a real New York Times headline about that album ready it's New York Times America has a problem and Beyonce ain't it that's the title of the article the article goes on to describe Renaissance her seventh solo album she finds Escape rebirth Community pleasure and control in decades of dance music steeped in Black queer bravado whatever that is Pitchfork another magazine went on to describe it Beyonce's seventh album is not just a pop star's Immaculate dance record but a rich celebration of club music and it's sweaty emancipatory spirit ah must be true you're obviously just pulling adjectives out of a hat it's sweaty it's queer it's bravado it's emancipatory well if you said it it must be true and even though I'm not enjoying this album at all I'll pretend to enjoy it because I guess she's too big to fail so we just allow her to drop a really bad album but never call it objectively bad so is the circumstance when it comes to Taylor Swift just like Beyonce she hasn't had a good studio album in a while the last two or three Taylor Swift albums have been objectively very bad but she does not know that because no one tells her that and whatever she produces they just pretend that it's another layer of Taylor that we're peeling back like an onion and that might be true we're peeling back the layer that's really bad and it stinks that's where we're at Taylor Swift's music is not good she just dropped an album that is called midnight and before I tell you about the album I want you to hear Taylor Swift describe the album too take a listen track three anti-hero is one of my favorite songs um I've ever written I really don't think I've delved this far into my insecurities in this detail before um you know I struggle a lot with the idea that you know my life has become unmanageably um advised and that I you know not to sound too dark but like I just struggle with the idea of like not feeling like a person um like don't feel bad for me you don't need to but you know this song really is a real guided tour throughout all the you know things I tend to hate about myself we all hate things about ourselves and um and it's all of those aspects of the things we dislike and like about ourselves that we have to come to terms with if we're gonna like be this person so uh yeah I like anti-hero a lot because I think it's really honest so mumbo jumbo nothing she said there made any sense and the album doesn't make any sense and the lyrics don't make any sense which is Taylor Swift so I don't know we're supposed to pretend that what she just said was magical and the lyrics are magical and she dropped a song I guess the main song that she wants featured and that she's speaking about is anti-hero like you just heard her describe it's the lead single and it's being described as true self-loathing and it ticks off Swift's deepest insecurities and it kicks off with this line I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser okay I'm gonna just read you some of these lyrics and you can listen to the whole song in your spare time if you want to hear where she is at as an artist but here here it is the hook the chorus is it's me hi I'm the problem it's me at tea time everybody agrees I should have laughed but it's just so not good that it's ridiculous it's so ridiculous ready this is um a couple of lyrics from the verse because it gets deeper sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby and I'm a monster on the hill ah oh my gosh that's so deep let me say that to you again sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby and I'm a monster on the hill that is that is so relatable I I feel like that sometimes too I don't know what a sex baby is neither do you but I guess this is supposed to be deep and we're supposed to think about it of course the journalists love to describe it as cryptic and there's some deep message that's in here so if you're not getting it because you shouldn't be getting it because it makes no sense actually the problem is you for not seeing how deep the porcelain urinal is because this is porcelain urinal for music right More lyrics I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money she thinks I left them in the will the family gathers round and reads it and then someone screams out she's laughing up at us from hell I don't I don't know what any any of that means but she jumps right back in back into the deep chorus it's me hi I'm the problem it's me it's me hi I'm the problem it's me hi it's me hi everybody agrees that this song sucks so I just want to bring it up because we are talking about how our culture is going down the drain in America and of course Hollywood is a big piece of this we don't Aspire towards Arch we do not have true lyricism anymore we don't produce poetry but we have a bunch of people applauding the non-poetry and pretending that we need to see this as something deep and special and it simply is not all right guys you know the next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on daily wire plus so if you're not a

addressing the Twitter files leak obviously that is a huge threat to the government and the DNC and people that have been communicating telling Twitter and other social media companies they must control the speech they must control the flow of information to accomplish their own ends they want everybody to roll up their sleeves and get a vaccine well they need to make sure that the social media companies are staying in line and censoring speech and that every time someone says I had a reaction to the vaccine or my Administration changed because of the vaccine that that person is taken off of the platforms and called the liar that a post has gone up and saying missing context right this is where fact Checkers come into place fact Checkers we know are acting they are bad faith actors that are working with in my opinion government agencies because it just seems strange that these social media platforms are seem to be supporting exactly furthering the ends of big Pharma", "Omu6nPY0CMw": "I really feel that I have to figure out more about the country stars that live here and I think you know Secrets I think you know a lot of stuff that you're not telling us about

Blake Shelton oh my gosh that's the Nashville tea Blake you know okay I played the the Grand Ole Opry one night this is the truth now about Blake Shelton I wish I had some dirt but I walked up on the microphone just sing a song it was some benefit show I was doing and Blake was the host and he he got up there and he requested a song that I had written in this I was in this band called boy howdy back in the 80s way back in the 80s with a mullet and the whole bit and he he introduced me and then he came over to me he said he goes play that boy howdy song he knew all the words to it he knew every single word to my like I'm like nobody knows this song Blake's one of those guys uh he has done his homework on everything and his influences um he wears him on his sleeve and he's one of these guys they're very hard to find in country music right right now where they they know all the history of country music a lot of guys now they don't know any of the history of the country he seems like a solid guy he's a solid guy um uh so I I have no I have nothing bad okay that's but that is that's at least a good spill we know he saw a guy okay number two Trace Adkins who has a voice like I've

rich John Rich okay John Rich uh me and John you know me and John go back to the early 90s he was a big fan of my band and I played this show in Reno one time in the sound man somehow got sick and John Rich from his band he was in a band called Lone Star and he had to uh mix the sound and so he mixed the sound that night and then and then we became fast friends and over the years John um i i i i there's nothing what am I going to say about John this is why everybody likes you because you have nothing bad to say about anybody but John but John gets a lot of rocks thrown at him yeah so maybe I'm the defender yeah I've seen John in so many situations where he's uh his heart has just poured out of his chest and he's he's uh I remember we went to a restaurant one night and it was this one guy he was so drunk and he was trying to get to his car and get in his car and drive home and John literally got up from the table walked over to the guy and talked to him for like 10 minutes and then he uh got him a car and drove him home and had somebody take his car home huh he just made his reputation even better I know and you know and then and then like like two years after that and I hung out with John a lot back in the day and um after my my boy died um I was like in this really really bad bad bad bad bad bad place and my life was just going through a whirlwind and he pulled me out of

personality like what about me yeah he's great he's dead best of both of us no this kid was driven you know as a toddler he would physically have to do something you know like hammer a door or you know just always engaging in figuring out something um as a as he got older he enjoyed sports football baseball in high school he was elected to be the captain of the football team after high school he came and worked and started his own company and was just really driven i mean we were proud of him because you know he purchased his own house at 25 and that was big doings for his generations it was a big accomplishment and so he's driven he knows what he he wanted a home provided for his family and um you know we have a very big family and we're all connected and we this is um devastating you know we've never gone through something like this before so it's unnatural for any parent to have to be looking at their son daughter or their children and realizing that they're going through something that's that's life or death yes yeah you don't i don't think you're ever prepared for that are you you know so yeah he um you know his mother all my kids you know he's you know he's um fighting for his life and we're trying to do whatever we can to help him it has been something that as a parent and as a human being does not belong in the realm of politics we're talking about someone who needs a heart and yet when this story went viral and was shared worldwide i remember reading the headlines nbc abc and you know op-eds saying this guy is not going to get a heart because he's unvaccinated good period good oh i didn't read it okay yeah nbc piece and that's good um as a mother and a father what is it like to hear people that are celebrating um that your son due to his personal medical decision to hear them speak that way about him as if he's not a person well first i'm angry very angry and then i just think that's an ignorant response personally um [Music] and obviously they don't know dj and how you know well i would love that person or whoever did that to switch places with my son and then you can continue on with the way that you think to change you know although i wouldn't wish this on anyone else because i don't think it's fair you know why don't they walk a mile in my boy's shoes before they cast judgment you know and it's just it's not right i mean doing to others as you would have them doing to you it's pretty simple you know he didn't do anything to hurt any of these trolls of these people yeah i'm choosing to essentially stereotype return my boy her son into a number and they're cheaping his worth by looking at their spreadsheet or their actuary tables or is cj worthy of getting a heart is he that much of a risk you've heard me

nurses aren't agreeing with this yeah but there are executives yeah and there are boards well we we had the opportunity to be at three different hospitals with dj during this battle of his that he's got with his art and so in all three hospitals it's just my opinion um is that you can sense the division you can sense closure with the met the professional staff because their jobs have been threatened you know we've lost many health professionals because of the mandate on the hospitals in massachusetts and there are some there are there are professionals in these hospitals that have said to us they're pushing me against a wall i have a home i have a family i'm a single parent you know these people are there but they're afraid to come forward because of those economical i mean it's it's sad because this division and the division is wrong and i you know i'm hoping that that will change soon thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this video subscribe to this

a lot of birthday fun but as it turns out if you're watching the news I probably won't make it to my next birthday because climate change let's take a look folks second year in a row the main New York metro area hit by this stuff uh let's not bury our heads in the sand when it comes to something has changed in the Atlantic the climate has changed it's called climate change folks there is a dramatic increase in gun violence when it is warmer and we are having this climate change effect that is driving that haven't the storms uh superstorm Sandy Irene last year having all of these recent storms and the fluctuations in temperature taught us if nothing else that we have a real climate problem well back to our top story the blizzard and every time we see a storm like this lately the first question to pop into a lot of people's minds is whether or not global warming is to blame and remember this is hardly the only climate related disaster that we've had this year this very well may be my last birthday guys so sad weird because when I was growing up a lot of this used to just be called weather like is I mean what has it changed now well I mean to me the big question of course is not whether climate change is happening I'm perfectly willing to accept that climate change is happening and that sometimes we now in the end of the century according to the ipcc there will be a climate change of something between 1.5 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius but what really has changed is the level of insanity surrounding climate change which is okay this is an excuse to now redistribute wealth globally it's an excuse to destroy every element of your lifestyle it's an excuse to get into your kitchen to get into your car it's a completely reshift all of human life and guess the American people are just not into it if you actually look at polls what you'll see is that the American people rank climate change on their list of worries they slightly below being run over by your neighbor's car right it really is not even in like the top 15. I just don't get how how does Al Gore still get a platform I mean he really missed it you know it was 10 years we passed it 2014 came it went and was the planet's still here so how does he still get a platform it's a good question and it's all these people who fear Monger the most about climate change are the ones who live in the mega mansions who fly private everywhere they're carbon Footprints are enormous so they don't even take it seriously and then when they get asked about it for example the climates are John Kerry they ask them why are you flying private everywhere and he's like well it's important and it's like I have to do this so I can go preach to the world about climate change Leonardo DiCaprio it's you know Leonardo DiCaprio he's got yachts and he's got to take the Yachts because he needs to meet up with gwetta thurnberg and the only way to get to her is with the you know gas guzzling yacht talk about climate change and fear is kind of the only tool they really have at this point they've been wrong on so many of their factual predictions that they realize people aren't really going to listen to our predictions anymore because they've been wrong for the last 20 years we need to rely on fear and what they're doing to the next generation is child abuse they have an entire generation now there's this thing called climate anxiety where millions of young people say they have anxiety about the climate it's kind of like going to the beach and basically your kid is like I'm afraid I might get attacked by a shark and rather than saying well we can take steps to protect you from sharks we'll probably be fine though it's like oh no if you get in the water you are going to be killed by a shark you are going to die that is going to happen it's instilling this fear in them rather than saying you're probably going to be all right maybe there's a stuff right and speaking of the children actually in an Earth Day climate con Congressional hearing that they had in California you actually had someone that had I guess zoomed in Greta thurnberg and we should watch that clip because she's basically saying like just like you mentioned her child is fearing for her life I have a nine-year-old daughter I have three kids and I told my nine-year-old daughter that I was going to be speaking with you and I said what do you think about the climate change climate change and she said the Earth is on fire and we're all going to die soon and I asked her how that made her feel and she said it made her feel angry what should I tell my daughter and how should I help her and the youngest generation bear the emotional toll of the actions that we're taking fossil fuel companies are taking to destroy our planet well it's it thank you for the question um that's a big big question and I know that there are many young people who feel angry and sad because of all the things that some people are are doing to to these planets and to to our futures and to to the most affected people already today and that's very understandable it would be strange if we didn't feel that way because then we wouldn't have any empathy I hope you're enjoying the show so far and I'm afraid to say it but at this very moment it is likely if you are using the internet that somebody is tracking your information taking your data and stealing it because that is what happens actually

CNET and wired and it's so important you guys protect your online activity today with the VPN that I trust to keep me private visit expressupn.com Candace you can get an extra three months free on a one year package that's expressupn.com Candace to learn more before we even get to Greta's absurd response can we just talk about how it just it always is that the Democrat politicians always seem to have a conversation with their kids about every single time remember how am I going to explain to my daughter that Hillary Clinton didn't just tell her she wouldn't go make your bet you know what I mean like if they always seem to have a scenario where they can insert a child into to emotionally manipulate the rest of us and they're thinking that this now needs to be addressed so I have three kids they are seven there are four and they're just above one and if my seven-year-old came to me and said I'm afraid that the world is on fire and we're all going to die I'd be like that's because you're a child and you're stupid because that's not true The World is Not on Fire life expectancy is the highest it has ever been in world history you got better if we really have to start worrying about you know dying but the fact that that Katie Porter's response is how does that make you feel not how does that make you feel you're just wrong because children are small and unintelligent right then hopefully later they become larger and less unintelligent but we now live in a world in which children are supposed to be our Guardians as a father of three children whom I dearly love I wouldn't let my kids guide me on nearly anything because they are small and they don't know things and I understand that the whole appeal of Greta timberg too was supposed to be that she's a small person now I can make fun of her as much as I want she's of majority I just turned 18. not for as much as I want the important thing for all of us to understand about Greta is that Greta disapproves of you she disapproves of you and she's disappointed in you and she looks at you and she's like I don't even know what to do with you she's disappointed I I actually wear a wristband most of the time says what would Greta do because that's all I care about in life is making Greta tunberg happy because I don't want her looking at me disapprovingly and saying how dare you that's all I care about in life this is the thing is that children have now become political props and that's exactly what's happening here it's so tragic that they're doing this and I know Ben you just said that like we can criticize her now because she's of age but at the at the same time they're still gonna be mad that we criticize because she has pigtails though somebody's gonna see this the segment and have like something to say about it that we're terrible and we're racist and we hate young women and all these other horrible things but thank you racist again you'll be surprised they'll figure out a way that what you did was somehow crediting her and her climate change Mission therefore we are right okay that's right so we gotta like somehow because the climate affects as you know black people more there was a years ago or maybe it was a couple years ago they ran the article saying that the climate affects black people more bad climate that's every New York Times headline yeah a bad thing happened women and minorities hit hardness and that's actually the point AOC made this week though which when AOC came out and said the green New Deal is no longer just about the economy it's no longer about our environment it's actually about combating racism we actually we have that clip let's actually show that clip we definitely have that clip there's no one who can explain it better than AOC we must recognize in legislation that the trampling of indigenous rights is a cause of climate change the the trampling of racial Justice is a cause of climate change because we are allowing people and we are allowing ourselves to make sure to we are allowing folks to deny ourselves human rights and deny people the right to Health Care the right to housing and education any person make that make sense here's the thing million dollars make it make sense if AOC was capable of picking up on irony which we know she's not she would realize the ironic thing about pushing the green New Deal in the name of combating racism economically speaking all the projections show that economically speaking it's people in low-income communities and its minority communities are the two people disproportionately impacted by the effects of the green New Deal this is not actually going to help people of color who she claims to be fighting for this is going to set them back economically meanwhile the wealthy people who are out virtuously about it they're going to be able to foot the bill just fine when everything goes up because everything is just a giant Mad Lib now yeah right it's just a bunch of blanks and then just fill it in with something it's like environmental justice social justice racial Justice education Justice and it's all about health care yeah look I don't know what the hell you're talking about about racism racism racism you have to insert it between every sentence so it's like Ed we want this racism if we don't get this racism if we don't get that racism and that's pretty much what we see on TV every day I'm like that didn't even make how could that possibly have to do with racism but she managed to get it in there she's so fresh and she is so famous she's talented she's a fresh face So Fresh So face yeah that's all that matters um so I actually do want to get to because you mentioned about the fear-mongering and project Veritas actually recently they've now been banned from Twitter because of this video um but they went undercover as they usually do and they got somebody from CNN admitting that they're just engaged in pure propaganda and that they're Switching gears away from Trump to you guessed it climate change let's just roll that clip real quick our Focus was to get Trump out of office right without saying it that's what it was right so our next thing is going to be for climate change awareness do you think it's gonna be just like a lot of like fear climate yeah pure cells pure cells I just don't get how they can get away with this and and yet James the person that gets banned from Twitter for having this investigative discussion I just don't get how they can get away with just constantly keeping Americans in a state of fear well I mean they need to because otherwise they can't get anything done right Biden there's an article in the Washington Post this week that specifically talked about how Joe Biden had promised that he was gonna be a moderate right who's gonna take it slow he's gonna be a return to normalcy but circumstances prevented that because there are four crises right the crises were climate change and covid and racial inequity and income inequality well three of those things were actually not crises okay racial inequity in the United States which is the single freest country on planet Earth is not a crisis in the United States income inequality in the richest country on planet Earth is not a crisis and climate change is not a crisis it is a gradually warning climate over the course of The Next Century the only real crisis was coveted and that is ending right now right so what he needs in as a lever to push forward his world-breaking agenda is the next Crisis you always need a crisis Gotta Have It thanks for

expressvpn.com candace hello and welcome last week you will recall i did a monologue addressing conspiracy theories the believable ones many of which have already turned out to be true but there was one line in my monologue one example of a widely circulated theory that at the very last second before we started the show i made a decision to delete that line read quote and there are some conspiracy theories that absent any concrete proof we all feel deep down might be true like the one about hollywood running a pedophile ring end quote i deleted that line because i thought despite my personal inclinations as to its potential veracity that it was too you know tin foily i've already lived to regret my last minute judgment call and here's why the hollywood pedophile ring conspiracy theory runs in parallel to the idea that there is an elite group of individuals in this country that are so powerful that despite routinely committing sex acts against children and despite our intelligence communities being fully aware of these acts they go unpunished because those would-be criminals serve a higher purpose for our government essentially prosecuting pedophilia ranks beneath other national interests now if you're sitting back thinking candace that sounds crazy or that sounds like something alex jones would say then you'd be right twice it is crazy and it is something that alex jones has said repeatedly that our government protects pedophiles it turns out that he wasn't lying last week buzzfeed a publication for which i normally have very little respect for put forth a stunning piece of investigative journalism that i think deserves a pulitzer the piece was 10 years in the making the journalists had to file 13 public record requests and three separate freedom of information act lawsuits over nine years to access closed investigations pertaining to our central intelligence agency the cia until finally this year the documents they requested were partially released to them and here is what those documents reveal per buzzfeed ready first it says that there's credible evidence from the last 14 years it suggests 10 cia employees and contractors committed sexual crimes involving children one employee had sexual contact with a two-year-old and a six-year-old second employee purchased three sexually explicit videos of young girls filmed by their mothers a third employee estimated that he had viewed up to 1400 sexually abusive images of children while on agency assignments another cia employee signed an affidavit admitting that he used a government laptop to view photographs and videos of girls as young as 10 years old being abused by an older guy the cia contractor logged into solicited sex chat rooms and he logged into a chat room and solicited sex from a child only to discover that that child was actually an fbi agent posing as a child one official extensively downloaded abuse material 63 videos of children between the ages of 8 and 16. the man regularly used government wi-fi to download the material he distributed it to others and he brought the photos back into the u.s after he returned from a trip overseas now that's just a few of them it goes on and on and on and on and yet turns out that only one of these sick perverts was ever charged with a crime and that individual it's important to know also happened to be under investigation for mishandling classified material in other words the cia had other reasons for wanting to see him prosecuted but everybody else nope nothing rather than prosecute these pedophiles the u.s attorney's office to whom the cases were referred to sent it back down to the cia to handle internally oh yeah you guys handle it by yourselves amongst yourselves their conclusion of course was that prosecuting these individuals would have procured public testimony that could have potentially exposed the cia's methods and sources let me run that one back to you there are young children who have been abused by individuals with top clearance in the united states government and they will never receive justice because because the government's methods are deemed more important let me run that to another way there are child pedophiles whom our government are fully aware of who are roaming around free in our society right now because methods are more important what does this all mean i don't know what does it mean that sex crimes against small children are being rampantly covered up by our government what did it mean when ashley biden the first daughter credibly acknowledged in her own diary that her father the sitting president of the united states took inappropriate showers with her and her youth which she believes contributed to her eventual hyper-sexualization what does it mean that our media many of whom are controlled by the cia chooses to ignore that what did it mean when hunter biden's laptop revealed text messages from hunter himself to his father worried that the public was going to find out about sexual allegations against him regarding his underage niece what did it mean when big tech and the press buried those allegations pretending that the entire laptop which we now know to be 100 percent authentic was little more than russian disinformation what does the current jeffrey epstein case mean i think it means that in most circumstances the term conspiracy theory is meant to gaslight the public to make us turn our cheeks and look the other way i think it means that pedophilia sexual crimes against minor children is not a crime in elite enough circles and it definitely certainly adds a new layer of understanding to administration and a department of justice that is fighting tooth and nail currently to expose children to indecent concepts in public schools oh the parents are domestic terrorists because they won't let us teach their children pornographic material they won't let us brainwash them into striving toward gender and sexual fluidity it means these people are perverts and it's time to stop being afraid to utter that truth if buzzfeed worked up the nerve i promise so can you protect our children at every single cost from

out Marching for the right to abort babies from their wombs nine months by the way now they're now we've gotten so radical this was first it's a clump of cells now it's like you know it's a full it's a full baby it's kicking in my stomach right now right now I'm about eight months pregnant but I don't care I want it taken out I want it gone because I want to live my life so in case you haven't seen it uh here are some of the marches that are taking place in Washington DC your sign says abortion is pro-life ask me how okay well I I'm admitting something that I've never admitted in public but in 1979 I had an abortion I was 21 and I now have two grown adult wonderful successful children that would not exist if I had had a child and had not had an abortion back in 1979. well I think let's stop right there not really sure that these arguments could get any worse well let me tell you they definitely can I have a fun game for you guys drink every time you hear this next woman say the word I I'm 35 years old I'm a mom um and I'm an attorney and um when I was in my 20s I got pregnant and I wasn't ready and so I had an abortion um which I don't regret at all uh because it's how I became the person that I am today I was 10 that was that was ten she said I 10 times that's what it is abortion the basis of these arguments it's a far cry from what happens if a woman gets raped it's just I I I I I me me me me using the internet without expressvpn is like leaving your keys in your car while you run into the gas station for a snack I mean most of the time you're probably going to be fine

an abortion and I talk about it and I find the more I talk about it the more people are like oh I had one too oh I had I also killed my baby it's like actually we're all just killing our babies and so like it's fine now it's like when I go to prison and I'm like hey I killed two people then I actually when I say it I look around the cells and actually a lot of people kill people and so like it's fine it's not a big deal if we're all doing it right I mean these are completely foolish and ridiculous arguments but of course the arguments have always been ridiculous and we've known that since we saw Michelle Williams take the stage talking about how Hollywood uh really determines these discussions and makes it seem like it's bold and powerful and she gave us Spirit a spirited a speech about how she wouldn't have won the statue had she not had made the decision uh to kill her child so let's rewind and watch Michelle Williams saying the exact same selfish argument that is really really understand scores all the leftist positions on abortion I'm also grateful to have lived at a moment in our society where Choice exists because as women and as girls things can happen to our bodies that are not our choice I've tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just a series of events that happened to me but one that I could stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over sometimes messy and scrolling sometimes careful and precise but one that I had carved with my own hand and I wouldn't have been able to do this without employing a woman's right to choose yeah right Yeah so basically we get it that Michelle Williams would not have been able to have the life that Michelle Williams wanted if she was not given the choice to abort her own child like so it's like you know my child I can kill you because I have a couple of career Ambitions that that's really what she's saying and in case people think that we're being dramatic when we say that some of these people take this argument that is a crucial discussion about life and they turn it into something that is almost satanic it's the celebration of death it's it's like watching them enjoy drinking blood that's how I feel sometimes when I hear them speaking about a baby a life so nonchalantly it especially is difficult for me now to hear these discussions when I'm pregnant when I'm eight months pregnant and I'm feeling my daughter kick inside of my stomach and move around as I'm sitting at this desk and to hear them talk about that life as if it's just so disposable it makes my ears bleed you want your ears to bleed well listen to this woman who was a guest on an MSNBC clip you're not even going to believe this I guess so I mean here's the thing here's my feeling about the leaker I I would like to find out who the leaker is so I could make sweet love to that person because that person is a hero to me okay and if the leaker a lot of people are saying it could be a conservative if the leaker is a republican uh and if I get pregnant during our lovemaking I will joyfully abort our fetus and let them know they're all laughing at that they're they're laughing at her making a joke that she prepared nobody stopped her she made the joke because she said I've got to admit it on MSNBC today I'm gonna make a joke about getting pregnant from a Republican and then happily aborting the fetus because I just I don't care and they're all laughing they think it's funny and that's what should disturb you regardless of whether you're pro-choice or pro-life or what your reasons are behind it what we're seeing has nothing to do with pro-choice and pro-life anymore are you pro-death are you celebrating and laughing as somebody presents an opinion or creates a scenario in which they would get pregnant and then I would just throw it away baby's half conservative I don't want that so I would just abort it hahaha I'll make love to you if you're if you're down to do that like if you actually leaked this document to allow for these radical protests for women that are broken on the inside showing up demanding the right to be able to abort their children so that they can sustain their careers and their livelihood that's the question that's for us today do you even understand what we're talking about anymore if your answer is no then you're you're like me I don't understand how we've gotten to this part of the debate where people are laughing and mocking the millions and millions of babies that never had a chance to live because the place that they should be the most protected they were violated in in the space that there should be no safer space than your mother's womb I remember having that discussion uh when I when I go and I speak in front of black audiences about what brexit means to me this black exit from these liberal policies right these liberal policies that have resulted in more than 19 million black babies being aborted I say to them here's what liberals will tell you they will pretend and Pitch this lie to you that the most unsafe place for a black person is on the streets the most unsafe place for a black person is when they see a police officer coming towards them it's unsafe for a black person when they see a white person in a room right and they and they say words and why people are speaking this is unsafe unsafe unsafe but the truth of the matter is is that the most unsafe place for a black child is in its mother's womb that's the truth 19 million plus babies aborted from their from their mother's womb black Americans since the passing over will be weighed thanks for joining me on this segment of Candace if you like this video subscribe to this YouTube channel and ring the bell to get notifications on new

than ever before and yet they're dumber than they've ever been so think about that think about that in your head how is that possible more degrees Dumber kids going out into the world I'll tell you how it's possible because our education system the Department of Education which should be abolished this was their mission their mission is not to make your children smart or productive in the world their mission is to turn them into activists for the government through their various different causes their mission is to get your children hooked to one of their many Cults that they're selling them so maybe the cult is race they want that child to come out and to scream black lives matter and to burn down the inner city communities and then to go oh my gosh we are facing a policing catastrophe even though we literally just said defund the police and now we're going to need more our money for the government to deal with this crisis that the very government created", "jNw09MJnp2Y": "where is blm now that the election is over hmm things have seemed to die down wouldn't you say but i wonder why because mission accomplished obviously um the entire point of black lives matter has absolutely nothing to do with black lives i have said this as loudly as possible for as long as i've had a platform and people don't seem to be getting it but maybe after the extraordinary effort put behind the george floyd protests and maybe now people are starting to question it just suddenly stopped just suddenly stopped the moment that biden got inaugurated and we've got no answers as to where those billions and billions of dollars went um that were raised off of so many faces and we know that we've had um the parents of some of those people who were killed speak out and say they never got any money and they feel like they're that their child's life was used to promote an organization that never gave anything back to the black community so i think that um that conversation has been furthered but of course you know black lives matter is is a political organization uh it is obviously it is a democratic run organization in my opinion we know that george soros funded them and gave them tons of money and you can pretty much guarantee anywhere george soros's money is is going to be corrupt it's going to be marxist and it's going to be about destroying american institutions and

about their race to get into college and that more than three-fourths of the people who lied got accepted but do you think colleges have gotten too political and will a college education soon be obsolete first and foremost yes he did tweet that he also deleted it uh because it was the first time that he was actually being honest about something and he realized that it signaled the opposite of what his entire brand represents which is the idea that black people are oppressed well black people are oppressed and there's this idea of institutional racism as as he suggests then why are white people pretending to be black to get into schools oh i know why because actually it's not true actually they've put in place systems that are that systemically oppress white people in terms of applying to school and it's unfair you're giving advantage based on the color of your skin it is the opposite of a meritocracy if you have anything you know if you're trans okay maybe they count that as a point are you black they count that as a point and they want to know all of these things they can hit they can hit the mark and say oh we we have at least this percentage of black people this is a percentage of trans people and they're not actually looking at students for their hard work so i am very inclined to believe that he was telling the truth and that white people are desperate to have even five percent of black and them so that they can actually uh be judged on what they know um which be actually be able to get in to the college that they deserve to get into on the basis of what they know um so i think that um in general we are coming to a place in society and i spoke about this earlier where we need to re-examine the american institutions uh when we have professors like the woman from rutgers university who is outwardly expressing genocidal uh tendencies and want pursuing this idea of white people not existing anymore and we've arrived at a problem and beyond that i'm not so sure that parents are really in touch with just how bad the universities have gotten kids are not actually having an academic education they really are having a psychologically conditioned education system that wants them to psychologically agree with with democrats on every issue they want them to come out and be dependent upon the government i i think the american uh college institution system as a whole has become quite useless over the over it's become quite useless i think that your kid would be better off going to a trade school learning a skill that they actually need than going and being brainwashed for years especially at the price point that it's at hopefully we have an actual reckoning about that one day thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if
