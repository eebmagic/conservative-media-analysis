starting to come back [Music] this is an autonomous zone 23 out of 24 hours in a cell no tv no magazines no books no nothing so anytime a customer brings a counterfeit bill you see we have plenty of them we tell them hey this is counterfeit if the customer insists then we call the police how did you feel watching the trial i thought it was a sham all right so i just want to start it with just you stating your name for the record as well as your professional background i have been a police officer in the state of minnesota for almost four decades forensic criminologist and certified medical investigator and police practices expert it's a good moment here it's like we live together almost uh i guess it was about four and a half years almost five years so you guys in many ways were some of the people that were the closest to him and i don't remember seeing your faces on the news or anybody talking to you so i guess let's just start with that you guys knew him best so who was george floyd she's right we haven't told our side of the story maybe it's time for us to tell our story you know", "UbCsRH3KcB4": "but you're told that for some like as soon as you get this degree everything is going to be great and that's not always true especially if you're a major in gender studies let me tell you and I am sorry I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand if you're majoring in gender studies because I do have nothing nice to say about that um I'm not going to call you out but it's oh give me a second so brave guys it's fine it's fine guys it's okay okay guys do you want to ask a question do you want to come down and ask a question or just Shout okay this is just a show [Music] I love it [Applause] all right can we get the Communists out of here guys honestly if you want to ask a question I want you to stay here but if you just want to shout and be an angry communist could you please just leave if you have a question stay here stay here right if you're actually here because you have ideas I want you to stay here if you don't all right then let's just get them out of here so we can continue the event great guys amazing amazing can we get him out [Music] sometimes I just want to sit here and see how long they can do this before they realize that nobody gives us like nobody cares [Applause] all right guys so brave so brave just get out [Applause] all right [Applause] and I think that kind of proves the point they never have anything smart to say they just they just scream that's it like they're just toddlers laughs [Applause] amazing amazing all right well I think we've identified the gender studies majors [Applause] they got really upset but jumping right into this and by the way I asked in the beginning if anybody didn't like me and I I always invite protesters to come inside and learn something and I actually want to hear their ideas I don't think it's good to be in an echo chamber but the problem is they don't have any ideas right so their whole strategy is to just be disruptive to act like toddlers until they have to be escorted out into timeout it's ridiculous it's not these people are not going to be productive members of society which is why they got upset because they are going to get that gender studies degree and then they're going to be met with the real world and this is what's problematic about these ideas right these ideas that this is a strategy or a way to get through life which is to essentially throw a temper tantrum the reason why I wasn't reactive to that is because I do have an almost two-year-old at home and he does that he you know he throws himself on the ground if he can't have a snack he screams when he doesn't get what he wants and that's because he can't yet fully speak English and he doesn't comprehend ideas this is the exact same thing that you just saw there's no difference they have no idea what's going on fu is not an argument so please if you are a conservative don't just stand up and say F you actually debate your ideas and show that we are the sensible side it's important to do that", "hRX4Hx8tLkE": "while Candace is here I feel like I can count on you to be with me about impeaching Biden immediately I am 100 on board providing immediately Candace already impeached him I just have one this I don't get too caught up on technicalities for what don't be ridiculous it's a ridiculous question impeachment we'll figure it out afterwards you gotta impeach him to find out what you mean that's exactly how it works why do you guys want kamo Harris so bad I honestly I do I think I do like I said before I didn't realize how stupid she was like I I honestly I was so focused on like the Trump versus I know how to say that that she flew under the radar for me and I am so impressed with her stupidity that I do want her to have a big platform I do also Camilla Harris has this thing about Venn diagrams I love nuclear fish my favorite President you get nuclear football and I love footballs and I love nukes who doesn't love football yeah how much Black America hates Kamala Harris it's incredible anyone at any risk of being lumped in or labeled on the basis of a Kamala Harris is going to hate her and so that's going to be all women that's going to be Black America and if you guys have your way and win with impeaching Joe Biden it will be all America who are suddenly being lumped in together with this it's just so unlikable and every time she opens her mouth I'm like that was really dumb my favorite thing I do love the my favorite thing store it's like Julie Andrew is my favorite things to her you have to say you know two drops and Raindrops on Roses right Venn diagrams school buses sorry I had to it actually that was that was related when she was uh she was in the DMV talking to like some random officers about outer space like looking at North Korea that was my favorite I found that very relatable actually like this is my I do like her I don't know it's my consolation tonight on Pennsylvania because if things don't go well for Dr Oz if we have the majority in the Senate and Dr Oz loses and John fetterman wins I know Republicans are going to be pulling their hair out I I do think it will be kind of funny I will get a kick out of it because we'll get control of the Senate and I'll get pretty good content for like six years so I'm not terribly upset about also Dr Oz is not a good candidate but I know we have to be unified tonight go out and vote for Dr Oz but he just is not a good candidate and so if we can keep control of the Senate and still get you know Kamala as President John fetterman as Senator that's kind of and that's my pitch because it's good for our shows to have contacts and we need Pamela Harris and we do have to fill I mean without Tiffany cross that's like at least five to seven percent of my content right that's on a regular basis so just a supply demand Pro I hear you", "pMc_EDK2S5Y": "okay so this is insane in real time right now I am watching uh Patrice colors do a live claiming that I went to her property and demanded to speak to her um and she's I I only I can describe it she sounds like she's really scared um we're working on a documentary talking about all the funding pertaining to Black lives matter obviously we know that Patrice and a lot of the founders purchased million dollars million dollar homes in white neighborhoods uh they also purchased a black lives matter property so we went to the property and asked if there was anyone that we could speak to very politely by the way we've got cameras in tow so there's no way she can it's all on camera and we just said I know we can speak to nobody asked us to leave um the person went inside it was just a white man that we saw outside that was providing security which is super interesting because obviously Patrice here is anti-police and so she's oh my God I think she's crying on this live pretending that she was harassed we like I said very politely to the guys I know we can speak to my name is Candace Owens we never went over the gate it was just me ringing the doorbell trying to speak to someone that he said absolutely nothing he started just recording us and we said okay because no one we can speak to we're gonna leave um Patrice is pretend tending to be scared because she knows that this black lives matter lie is falling apart um and she doesn't know what to do I mean people are aware of the scam it as black lives matter she's intentionally limited the comments so you can't even comment on this post because I was going to comment and be like this is a complete lie and we have it all on camera in terms of what happened so what you are seeing right now is the face of a woman who is pretending she's afraid of right-wing pundits when in reality she's being exposed as a fraud who took Millions used to faces of black people took millions of dollars to fund herself to fund her lifestyle to fund her girlfriend and to buy a million dollar mansions in neighborhoods where no black people live so Patrice um this footage that we this story that we're covering is it's just a significant one I have always been interested in the fraud that is black lives matter your fake tears your crocodile tears about someone politely ringing your gate and speaking to your white security guard and and asking if there was anyone that I could talk to because I was covering the story um not really going to cut it Patrice this is only going to commit me further to discovering the truth about what you have done with this funding black people died you use their faces to raise money you demanded that the policing be stopped you demanded that police officers be defunded but you've got a private security detail outside of million dollar homes it just doesn't work this way sweet heart so the truth shall set you free or can of someone shall set you free girl because I'm about to tell the truth all right we're still filming bye", "6PgsG-Lw1W0": "hey guys it's candice owens and today we are going to be talking and taking a look at bad parenting as an overview i would say that right now in america we have a problem with woke parenting in particular like these parents need to be parented and so they are trying to raise their children so that they can put up a status on facebook and get applause for being so loving and welcoming and at the end of the day you know kids are little rugrats and they need to be parented and told what's right and what's wrong um not that everything that they do is right there's just too much validation going on for children and parents have completely abandoned um what it actually means to rear a child my general parenting philosophy is i'm the boss you're the applesauce my husband and i genuinely believe we are the parents you are the child you know obviously you can imagine basically my husband's english so if you've ever seen like nanny 9-1-1 when they bring the nannies over from london and they're like you should not do that that's my husband and i support that kids need rules kids need schedules they need guidelines there's a time and a place you know for children to express themselves but you know they we believe in the word no there's nothing that bothers me more than parents so i mean they're like we just don't want our child to have any negative reinforcement we just like don't want our child to hear the word no and i'm like are these the kids that grow up and become like rapists and killers she's like they don't understand the word no like what kind of what do you mean you don't understand the word no you know kids need to understand that they are allowed to do certain things and they are not allowed to do certain things okay so let's dive into some of these videos that you guys have for me the school district now it's a freaking nightmare i go to enroll my child and my kiddo is standing right there i hand them the birth certificate and i say see right here this is his sex he is a boy he goes by he him i had no issues at his past school and i don't expect to have any issues here and i swear it was like karen the transphobic secretary was just waiting on us that day she said she wouldn't put my child in the school system as his name because it has to match a birth certificate but again had no issues with the last goal i told her i absolutely would not enroll my child as a female and she said you will and you are she enrolled my child as a female that sent mail to my house with my child's dead name on it at this point my child is supposed to start school on monday is rolled in the system as a female every single teacher in the school knew about my child and the students were told a little girl was coming to class this is a visual representation of my mood like and follow for part three yeah that's that's scary that's actually just scary i mean that's if you check on that child in 18 years that child is going to be so messed up and the fact that this is on the internet and nothing's going to be done about it is the worst part of it like people are basically saying i'm abusing my child i'm going to make a tick tock about abusing my child and nothing's going to happen to me because we've mainstreamed child abuse i'm sorry what oh no ma'am no well you watched it at school uh what's it called oh no no with the children white white people should not ever be talking about putting on war paint that is a racism that is appropriation the ancestors died trying to defend themselves okay so no that is not okay movies that i enjoyed that i could no longer watch because i know better homophobia transphobia mocking people with disabilities sexual assault misogyny i'm not gonna touch that one because you all know and before you go saying why can't you just let her enjoy things because when you know better you do better and when you know better you teach your children better and if i just let her go along with it and tell her it's okay then show her world thinking that it's no big deal and then she'll grow up ignorant like you oh gosh it's just so much it's first off it's so much ignorant she talks about talking about war paint obviously a reference to native americans don't let your children wear war paint because they died fighting for their lives um no you know people don't know this but the majority 90 90 plus of native americans died because they caught smallpox and the settlers had no idea that they had smallpox so that was by disease it wasn't a genocide that was trying to be committed against the native americans beyond that native americans cannibalized one another literally ate one another and you can find that even in the new york times which acknowledged that in doing an anthropological study of what was left over in colorado they determined that they did that so this whole idea that native americans were just gatherers sitting around kumbaya until settlers came is just so fictitious and ridiculous human beings have been at war since the beginning of humanity and for whatever reason the only people that they want to bear any responsibility for that war are americans and i just can't imagine raising a kid that can't enjoy basic things that kids shouldn't have to think like this i just i loved i remember actually when i was a kid i loved the pocahontas um soundtrack so much that was back when we had the little vhs cassettes that you could put in and you could just rewind it and listen to it over and over again and i just to me that's a celebration um you know of of native american culture i never thought of it as like well this is a horrible you know song and how could disney possibly do this and we're horrible people like children are supposed to be wildly imaginative and beyond that you know everything they do what is the intent behind something when a child is dressing up like something it's because they're envious you know they they go i love this so much i want to look like this person and you don't want them to feel that way it's like the disappearance of the land of lakes butter lady so your solution to the idea that we disappeared native american culture is to disappear even further and allow it to be seen nowhere i mean that doesn't make any sense whatsoever it's just sheer stupidity and yeah it's gonna really suck to to have that as a mother growing up are you sure i mean does everything have to be about race all the time oh honey i'm really sorry that happened you know sometimes we think that racism is a thing of the past or that it's about one individual person or a group of people treating others differently in reality racism is systemic that means that it's written into our laws and policies and it affects every part of our life i'm really glad you're bringing attention to it which law which policy mom uh mom can't answer it because there's literally not a single law or policy that is in place that is racist there just is not it's just a repeat talking point they just keep saying there's systemic racism and there's laws and there's policies that impact black americans then when you ask them which one specifically they can't answer the question because as i said you're dealing with parents that are stupid and they're passing down stupidity to their children and by the way the fact that these parents are always doing this online should really tell you that this is not about fighting any sorts of oppression it's about getting likes and clicks i mean there's a underlying narcissism that's happening like i said they do a lot of this stuff because they want to show their friends how amazing and how woke they are it's really pathetic and it's sad because the only people that hurt because of it are children when they're designed to see every little thing and every little interaction that they have as an act of racism so you're singing to him does he enjoy the singing and what are you singing to him it's it's a lot of show tunes because that's what i like so um you know we're raising him gay until he decides he's straight okay and on the way back from the hospital um we played britain spears because that was what justin demanded he listened to that was his first exposure to music um but yeah it's a lot of singing i'm you know writing a lot of songs for him you know everything has a song you know i got a poop in my dipped up and my daddy i mean you can make a song about anything wow well that's a catchy one um so so you're raising him gay until he says he's straight but you'll love him just the same if he is straight right absolutely not actually justin i was saying he's absolutely gonna be i could just probably be like such a straight kid who knows i'm gonna do whatever he wants but like i'm like i just have a feeling like you're gonna want to play football i could just tell and i'm gonna have to learn how to do all those things with them right well if if there is a god yes because it would be wonderful to see you trying to do that with him um so you're reading to him also does he have a favorite book um well we like some of the classics like we have about eight eight copies of the hungry hungry caterpillar um but what the one of the new books that i found that i really love is a is a book called um the the hips on the drag queen go swish swish swish you joined tick tock here's oh wow i didn't i i didn't know that book but that's a catchy one that's i like that tune better actually until the very end i thought he was being intentionally funny like it was just a joke saying that he's going to raise his kid to be gay and until he comes out a street like i thought he was just being tongue-in-cheek and it was light-hearted and it was a good interview until he said that he was reading a drag queen book to his child i have so many opinions about the whole drag queen thing i think it is such an entryway for pedophilia and that this has become a cultural phenomenon of letting you know perverts dress up around children and read story time to them and trying to normalize that like it's a normal thing for a grown man to want to dress up as a woman and be around small children has always really disturbed me yeah other than that i thought he was just being funny tongue-in-cheek but the end there i was like okay this is a weird book for you to have unless that was supposed to be a part of a skit actually yes i do and it's kind of weird because just she looks normal my family and i were talking about that and how if we had another baby say like tomorrow um that we would probably not gender that baby until they were old enough to decide on their own what they felt like it's just you i mean you can look at that person and see it this is not a person that's mentally stable because you just don't make yourself look like that unless you have issues you just don't i'm sorry and people that are trying to pretend that that's normal oh i'm just like you know i just don't conform to standards it's like no there's something wrong with you you're actually screaming for attention that that's also a reason why you're deciding that you don't want to gender your child because you're screaming for attention you want people to know that you're not being normal because you desperately seek some attention and unfortunately when you're using your child as a conduit to that attention you're also causing harm i mean the idea that children have it within them the ability to make decisions is i mean it's just it's so radical it's so crazy and the sad part is is that when that child becomes an adult and realizes that they suffered from not having an adult that raised them it will be too late they will have mostly ruined parts of their lives you know and so it's unfortunate to see that i wish that we had a proper cps system that would actually get involved and they knew that they had adults that were you know raising their son as a daughter or their daughter as a son because kids don't make that decision parents do it's like i always say that when you see the trans thing and someone says that they have a trans child or an you know non-gender conforming child it's like meeting someone that tries to tell you that their dog is vegan like you know who's making the decisions dogs eat meat and children do not think about gender and sexuality okay so these are the kids that are being segregated and forced to eat outside this isn't really bad parenting this is it's it's an extension of bad government policy um backed up by parents who would ever allow this to happen in their children i i can't even wrap my head around me being okay with this you know sending my child to school and learning that they're eating outside uh they have a virtual zero percent of catching covid and dying from it rather i just can't imagine what parents have been this adaptable to what really is just tyrannical policy um that's ultimately dehumanizing your child so i just the circumstances make no sense to me this is this is it's horrible and it's something that all parents across the nation should be standing up against i think as a final thought that shame works and that parents should feel free to comment to other parents that what they're doing is disturbing i think the reason why this has become so popular online and we're seeing so much of this is because the parents that are raising their children correctly are silent because they're so fearful that well i just don't want to be that parent at school or i don't want to be that parent that is told that they're not accepting because my child is a non-conforming you know trans robot you need to stop worrying about acceptance and actually start thinking about the society um that your child is going to be forced to grow up in and so find your voice say that you find to be disturbing and in most circumstances for me like i would report i honestly report half of the things that i see um to police officers to child protective services because it's it's really alarming to me that child abuse has become mainstreamed",

cannibalism of indigenous tribes they can forget the heinous actions of imperialistic egyptian empire the turkish empire the muslim abbasid in rashidun we can forget the fact that the overwhelming majority of the world's empire were not run by white men they also by the way choose to forget the fact that the first to abolish the practice of slavery was great britain followed by the french colonies who were then followed by the united states three countries of white men led the world in ending it", "UXTnLyLrhww": "i want to talk about why we get manipulated i'm being serious guys i'm not even trying to make this like a contentious moment because this is literally why black america loses right here because we allow people with cameras to go hear a whole speech like they do this to me all the time they take out a couple of sentences you said and they create a whole new headline and people that were not there i've been watching this i just ti gets me so angry actually go back to hear what was actually said in full context they do it to me all the time i know they do it to trump he has denounced white supremacy so many times he it's something north somebody counted up 24 times and it's on his twitter feed so if you want to fact check me go back to a couple of weeks ago when the shootings happened he said america is no place for white nationalism and white supremacy and it's issue that has to be tackled i'm paraphrasing you can go find out let me tell you why the black vote is the easiest vote for democrats to keep for the last 60 years let me tell you something if people know what you fear you are the easiest person to control the democrats have figured out that black america is emotionally responsive to the word racism she says racism you jump up and you start cheering you haven't even listened to what i've said to rebut it okay i do not consider myself a republican i do not i definitely am not a democrat but trump woke me up i used to be liberal trump woke me up to the idea that we're being manipulated by the word racism every four years that aged well i think there were a bunch of elements of this clip that were taken and it kind of turned into the ti versus candace thing and which i think is a shame because actually if you look at the comments the people that actually watched the panel especially people that were in the audience were really happy with the panel because i don't think they had ever heard me speak and i kept people kept coming out to me after being like why don't you say this stuff that you said on stage like everywhere else and i'm like i literally do you just never get to hear anything i say because people always parse out um just one element of it but t.i was the most frustrating person because he is so fake i cannot even tell you so i met ti because kanye introduced us he i don't know how he gave i think he gave me ti's number we talked on the phone before this panel tni had probably spoken on the phone like six or seven times and the opinion of everything that he gave me on the phone is so different than the ti that showed up on stage that day so he's a true entertainer so when he gets on stage he's going to say whatever he thinks he needs to say to get people to get hyped whereas everyone else in the panel despite how much you disagree with them on they were extremely authentic like especially killer mike who i still talk to today he's like such an authentic guy even sneaking mallory who i like am adamantly opposed to she was super respectful and really nice and genuine like she was she was being genuine t.i came there to entertain and um you know he's super ignorant but he's just also he's two-faced right so that was the most frustrating part of the panel was that ti was just being so two-facing next to me trying to get the the audience hyped and against me now she's like this is not the same ti if he gets the phone with kanye he's like oh yeah man i understand it's funny he's like oh yeah i totally understand and then he gets from the audience he doesn't care about what he said it's all about what is going to make the audience be hyped and hear my point so he sucks and more than sucking though is that he got his perfect karma because now ti is under investigation him and his wife are under investigation for a bunch of like horrible sex crimes and i don't doubt it he's actually very disrespectful and denigrating to women in general and you kind of see that side of him when you spend a little more one-on-one time with him but overall i was really very very happy i mean did he was sitting in the front row with the panel i think there needs to be more of it and people are always like why don't you do more events like this i'm like when i'm invited i always go i think we should always go into rooms people think they disagree with you because that's when you transform the most minds and without question so many minds were transformed in the room that day i would love to be invited to another revolt summit and i stayed in touch a lot of people that were that are on that stage even still today not ti honestly i don't think it would have been fiery if t.i wasn't on stage like doing so much shouting i was told it was a political summit i knew he was gonna be on the panel so i knew that we had different perspectives i would say killer mike is probably somewhere in the middle like he's just kind of he's just like a very kind person even though he has some socialist beliefs i don't know where he comes out you know comes out of left field with you know i i knew where they all staged there were no surprises like i obviously knew that i was going to be like the token conservative and i was fine with that because i think i mean i believe what i believe so i believe that on any stage and i'm on anywhere um and i have the facts on my side so i'm never um scared or embarrassed to go on to issue but i disagree with me", "cLRn6MbfOBg": "what what is the whole feminism like movement it's just it's so fit come on feminism is it's the biggest joke in the entire world nothing first off nothing that feminism aspires to today modern feminism makes women happy i don't even understand anymore like a guy opens a door and you're like oh yeah why are you holding a door for me i can do it myself that's what it is like what's the definition of like feminism today it's a shifting definition there's been different waves of feminism but today they pretend about equality with medicine not they actually hate men and usually the people that are at the forefront of the feminist movement are the basis of equality that hate men i mean like the you got lena dunham like who just rants and raves about how men are awful and terrible all the time who is to me the mascot of the fourth wave feminism it's like if you don't like my body for being 3 000 pounds it's because of the patriarchy no it's because nobody likes that that's disgusting it's unhealthy and nobody should want to date that like women i don't want to look at it men don't want to look at it and i'm straight like so it's a cop-out it means i don't want to get healthy but instead of me going to the gym i'm going to say that the men the patriarchy created this idea that people should be healthy and take care of themselves it drives me insane i absolutely cannot stand it what about women that always say like women don't get paid as much as men yeah i always hear that how do you respond to that it drives me insane it drives me insane but that's true it is not true when they do the same jobs as men i'm sorry you want to work at vogue and pick out pretty bags for a photo shoot but you don't get paid as much as an engineer men and women have different interests we are biologically different when i was in school every single girl that i was friends with was majoring in either comms or tmd fashion right the truth is is that if you go into a career and you want to be a buyer for macy's and men are you know taking business classes and want to go be ceos of hedge funds they're going to make more money we have different interests and our there's nothing wrong with that by the way like i men and women are not the same we are biologically different we have biological predispositions the idea that women should want to climb the top of a ladder and you know go into corporate america and be there forever women want to have kids right so there's another reason that they're not making as much money as men is because a lot of women want to stay home with their children which is an admirable goal which feminism tries to wipe away like oh if you want to stay at home something that women say to me all the time why don't you make your husband a sandwich okay is he hungry does he want a sandwich did he say something i make my husband food the last four nights i made my husband dinner like i don't understand this weird maker like they they're trying to shame women for taking care of their families like that is another element of feminism that i cannot stand there's it's an attack on family and these things that work it works men are biologically unable to have children so the aspiration to climb a ladder forever to wake up every single day and and not have to worry about being pregnant for nine months i mean that makes sense we're different creatures you know i think that's like a troll though no it's like all you're good for is like yo make me something to eat no they that whole concept came from rabid feminists like there was something wrong with being in the kitchen right okay and this was sort of this push of women get out of the home and go to work which has made so many women miserable so many women miserable and most of them when it's too late because they feel this pressure now of like oh well if i if i don't aspire to anything other than like family then i'm gonna somehow be a failure and so they take on these jobs that a lot of them take on jobs that you know they know is not going to result in some budding career like it's usually in fashion or textiles or something like that when in reality women want to be married you know happily married it's an admirable goal yeah sandwich sounds pretty good though yeah you know i i mean if my husband ever wanted a sandwich i'd make it for him you're worried about raising your your boy with how controversial you are and all this stuff like raising him in the climate that you're creating here no i mean worried in what way worried meaning like you're bringing him to a world where you're a figure that's talked about non-stop and he's going to be hit early probably as a young kid with dealing with the stuff that you kind of created and kind of he's just born in that world where you gotta get what i'm saying or no i think that's a good question it's a good question yeah i mean no the answer is no i don't think unless you want your kids to be like i'm not raising my child in the public eye i don't post pictures of my family like on the internet so i think he'll be separate from that my child's not allowed to have technology if he wants an iphone he can have it when he's 30 and out of the house you know what i mean like yeah 30 and out of that yeah how are you going to like know where he goes i'm being hyperbole he'll probably get it when he's you know off to college or something i'm i'm very against technology i think it's it's ruining children when you look at these girls and they're getting their lips and their butts done and they're like 12. my gosh no are you crazy i like all natural i thought the girls debate whether they're getting right they look so much so much full of [\u00a0__\u00a0] you're probably you are probably full of it i'm not at all no no not at all i just literally like a girl that's all natural they just actually turns me off to be honest like fake tits and like the lips are the worst the white girls on the lips that has to stop yeah it has to that's like really popular right now they look like they got beat up it's crazy like you know then then like then it definitely if it's overdone it looks terrible yeah and then it like deflates a little bit and then like one side's higher than the other and i'm like why did you do this to yourself why did you beat yourself up i don't understand it you've never gotten any work done yourself no work all night no work all natural beautiful yeah i don't i mean i never say never like maybe when i'm after i've had like four kids and uh but i'm not touching my face i have a weird like thing about touching my face like i'm just like so i'm not touching my face i don't think it ever i mean sometimes actually if you have a really bad nose girls get that job it looks good yeah yeah oh it's like kyle he loves fake racks and stuff so i don't know i do yeah you probably offer her to buy girls fake ass [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah i've never done that like hang around with me would you i mean she might need it if it's you if it's what you're into you can ask right yeah whatever it doesn't hurt yeah if she's your boo yeah um but yeah i agree i think i think girls look more beautiful covered up i think girls look more beautiful with their natural faces i don't understand this new trend and it's alarming to me how young the girls are doing it younger and younger and younger when i was that age i had braces like i was playing outside like i was a tomboy i was choreographing dances you know i just don't understand why these girls are like this now actually i do understand it's because of instagram yeah i'll agree with you there it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] up yeah every girl wanted to be kylie jenner yeah she started a whole new trend and in reality the idea that her mother let her do that to her face and her body when she was 17 years old it should have been a crime yeah like she looks a lot better now though i don't know what she was going to look like she was a kid true true think about what you looked like at 17 years old she didn't get to grow up i mean i had baby fat i do like pictures of me at 17 i'm like an entirely different person i feel like i started my face started to mature when i was 23. have you done botox or no nothing nothing i've never got an injection ever in my face ever wow anywhere in my body i shouldn't say my face i've never gotten an injection of anything in my face yeah like it's flawed you're flawless thank you very much flawless thank you i think kylie's really bad though we pulled up some bad ones that went bad but i'm black yeah look at how young she was look i mean you don't even think about she's got bangs like since she's a kid you know what i mean like yeah yeah yeah i think she was 15 in that picture natural beauty over there so she probably had time to develop yeah even a haircut would have changed her you know what i mean i understand what she did because this was what was happening all the time because her sister was in the spotlight and people kept comparing her not realizing she's a t she's a kid i mean 15 years old look at what she's wearing she wouldn't even wear this look at pictures of what i wore when i was 15. i'm like ew what was this disgusting look or the way i was doing my makeup but you know it's just you're a kid you have time to develop you grow up when you hit your 20s you start i still feel like i didn't really figure out i feel like until i was 26 really it's kind of where i was like oh okay actually that outfit looks really bad like you know we were all wearing like weird american apparel harvey leger thinking we looked cute it's just she was a kid this is kind of like hollywood now right this is hollywood though they want you to like hollywood right no i hate it they want you like you're 25 when you're 15 and people feed into it so she was just tremendously insecure because she had cameras around her house so she was going through her awkward phase and girls go through a really bad awkward phase guys have it a little better and so she changed her whole face and her whole body i don't know what she would have looked like i really don't one of my favorite feuds that you had was with um harry styles does that still talk about actually no i feel like harry and harry styles i would actually be friends i think he's cheeky i have to tell you because you did you throw shade at him which i could do he has no drip i'll give you that but girls love that guy no i think he's very talented but and personally for me i could not like a man in a dress is just not attractive to me don't care there's no way to make it trendy to me at all men should be men meant to dress like men it's just not my thing but we're kind of getting into a society where like things are getting weird i think they're just trying to be talked about when they do that that's and that was my point i mean that's what i think 100 percent is why they're doing it why are you on the honestly girls love it so when he posts in a photo of address and all the girls love it they don't they love that they do not know they love him because he's talented he's talented and he sings and it's he's got the rock star thing going on sure so harry styles being an exception women do not like men that wear dresses even if they were dating harry styles they wouldn't want him wearing a dress yeah they'd be like why are you wearing a ball gown today where are we going we're going to starbucks i'm going to put on a ball gown no woman likes that do not believe women like that what people like online is to pretend that they're woke and like oh my god this is amazing gender is a construct oh my god this is amazing like i worship oh my god like that's online culture it's not real life

haven't any of the alleged courageous leaders on black issues of oppression mentioned any of this because they aren't leaders at all they're all extortionists", "2e9N_e6L7Xk": "hey guys candace owens okay so i get a ton of questions about dating i guess people want me to give them dating advice so i'm gonna answer some of these questions now [Music] when should i start talking to my partner about marriage i'm probably the last person you should ask this to or maybe the first person you should ask this to don't forget i got engaged after two weeks and when i say after two weeks i mean i met my husband and then i was engaged two weeks later to him i'm a big believer in not wasting any time i know like there's i guess now some modern wisdom you wait two years and then you start bringing up engagement but that's two years of your life you're not getting any younger women are definitely have to pay attention especially if you want children so i think that if what you're looking for in a relationship is eventually marriage and kids you should feel comfortable talking about that right away it doesn't mean that the marriage and the kids and engagement has to happen today but does let you know that you're dating somebody that is a serious individual and is not here to just netflix and chill as the kids are saying these days what questions to ask on the first date how did you know so soon with your husband okay two different questions um with my husband it was really weird um i just looked at his face and i knew i was gonna marry him it's the most bizarre thing in the entire world like it was his face i don't know if i've seen it in a dream but i was like that's my husband no questions asked it was like a poll that i can't even explain it was almost scientific in terms of questions that you should ask on a first date definitely figure out what they're looking for i think that a lot of times men will be quite honest about that and even if they're not honest to your face they won't text you after that and just you know it'll let you know that they're just kind of looking to play around um so you should ask questions that give you the answers you're looking for if you're somebody that wants a serious relationship you should ask that individual are you looking for a serious relationship are you looking to commit or you're just kind of looking to date around as i said before if it's guys that are just looking at data around it's a total and utter waste of your time i don't think there's any reason at all for any women in the modern age to stick around the guy that's not looking for anything serious what was the worst piece of dating advice that you received and did you follow it oh gosh well i feel that any time you are dealing with women that have this sort of flamboyant oh just have fun just do whatever like it totally doesn't matter like it does matter it actually does matter and i think that when i was younger there was all this encouragement coming from various sources that like you know to be a woman in the modern age means to sleep around to date to be like a guy doesn't matter you're going to have no feelings you will have feelings i mean i think you know hooking up dating cuddling all of that is inherently something that inspires you to have feelings oxytocin for example as they call it the cuddle hormone that's a real thing um and so when people are trying to tell you um that you're going to out think that and it's not going to matter you can just have a casual relationship with a guy i think it's the worst piece of advice you can possibly give a young woman in the end it just ends up with them being hurt where to meet strong conservative man not on instagram i'm not being funny when i say that um i'm always very suspect when guys are very into social media i think that psychologically uh everything that's on the internet is almost like soft porn it's actually something that i've talked about with my husband and it's not good if guys are constantly looking at i guess advertisements for different women and i think it's the reason why we have men in the past that seem to be so focused on their families and men today who kind of feel like oh well look tinder i can just swipe to the left or i can buy a different brand as if they're shopping for cars um in different makes in different years so i think that depending on a how religious you are you can definitely meet a good person in church but in any sort of conservative institution you know i know people that like to go to political events tend to find others that are drawn by the same interest and they find that oh hey we have the same thoughts and ideas by going to a conference or something of that sort so um if you're interested in conservatism do conservative activities and you're likely to draw a conservative to yourself what are your thoughts on saving kissing for marriage you know i would say that i would not expect people to save kissing for marriage but it is funny because me and my husband did not have our first kiss until after we were engaged so i mean post-engagement but that was just kind of because we got engaged so quickly but no i don't think it's a problem for people to be kissing before they're married um i have i think that that's i don't judge you if you want to wait to kiss until you're married uh but i don't think it's a bad thing to kiss someone before you get married what are your suggestions for a relationship in a rut with a lot of frustrations my suggestion and this would actually go back to probably the best piece of dating advice i ever received was from bruce jenner on a very early season of keeping up with the kardashians he was talking to courtney about her rut of a relationship with scott disick and we know how that turned out and he said when you're dating somebody that's as good as it's ever going to get and what he meant by that was that a lot of people have this idea that your relationship's going to get into a rut and it's going to be weird and it's going to be bad but then once you get married and once you have a kid it's going to be happily ever after and so many women kind of hold this perspective it's like just as soon as i get the ring it's going to be better and that's not true i think uh when you're dating you know that is kind of the high the emotional high the oh my god this is amazing and so if you're starting to see that start to taper off and you're not married yet you're just in a relationship i'd pay attention to those signs because you may not have found that person that you're meant to do life with hi candace as a gen z i wonder where can i find masculine men you should date a 60 year old i'm just kidding don't date a six-year-old but i understand the predicament that you're in and it's partially due to this culture that is telling men to be more feminine it's super frustrating but they do exist and actually what you will find is that the more effeminate men exist in these city bubbles and when you kind of move into the rest of america you're still going to find the farmers the ranchers people that are working with their hands the construction workers i mean the qualitative difference in men from when i lived in new york and lived in dc versus when i moved here to tennessee i can't even tell you like it's just it's not even the same ballpark they're there probably just not in those cities that a lot of people tend to go into when they're in like college and you know at university and things of that nature do you keep in touch or follow any exes answer that is absolutely not i am super conservative when it comes to that i think when you are married woman i'm i'm not about that life of oh i'm just friends with my ex i think if you've ever had a relationship with another man it's super disrespectful especially in a marriage to maintain a relationship i don't buy any of that like we're just friends and yada yada yada but it used to be more it's just a definite knot for me i seem to be more mature than guys my age and makes it harder to and commit any tips i don't know how old you are but that's very common guys take a lot longer to mature than women guys kind of have to get that thing out of their system and i'll tell you a secret they never really grow up you got to see even the men when they get together they turn into little boys i mean my husband and like building himself a man cave and then hearing the construction workers talk to him oh we could put a humidor would be so cool could be like batman um so there are aspects of a guy which are very sweet they're kind of always boys but i i find that guys kind of ripen around 28 29 like in their mid-20s so if you're younger than that you're probably not i mean there's always exceptions but as a rule younger guys are a little bit more immature than women and we actually tend to mature a lot quicker and there's probably some biological aspects of that women you know we have to carry the children and these are our baby-making ages and i actually even if you look at a little kid little boys versus little girls the little girls are so nurturing and they got their dolls they're gonna take care of the dolls and the little boys are just like banging their heads into trash cans they're like it's really funny so it's super endearing they do eventually grow out of it they never really grow out of it but they will be ready to commit and be in a serious relationship so i mean i dated an older guy once um he was nine years older when i was 21 and it was great it was nice and it it felt like that was the right thing for that time for me so i'm not giving you advice to go find an older man i'm just saying they do eventually grow up if you have great communication with a guy but he's asking sexual questions do you cut him off since he's most likely like that with other girls yeah i mean i'd probably say that that signals to you that you don't really have great communication with him i just find that to be weird if you're just talking with him and he's asking you like explicit questions it's i don't really find that to be appropriate i mean i don't know the nature of a relationship but i would think that that that's pretty telling of what's on his mind um what's a primary concern on his mind and i don't think that unless you're looking for that i would imagine that that's probably all the red flags that you need best place to meet quality women that aren't fickle church eight years together i called off engagement because he's still not ready can't leave each other though leave oh my gosh i can tell you horror stories of girls that do this i mean i know two girls that were in relationships for 10 years with a guy and gave these men their best years because you know men kind of age like fine wine and you know they don't have to worry so much about their reproductive vitality and women are not the same and so if you're giving your this guy eight years to make a decision and the decision is still i don't want to make a decision then i am telling you he is the guy i've seen it happen twice that is then going to meet a girl like you're just there you're a placeholder he's going to meet a girl and he's going to be engaged two weeks later and three weeks later and you're gonna be like what happened to the last eight years of my life and i feel so terrible for those girls but they knew they should have left earlier they didn't have the strength to do it have the strength to do it leave don't be somebody else's placeholder i'm 15 and there's a girl i like and i don't know how to ask her on a date just ask her the worst thing that can happen ready is she's going to say no that's it and you know what you're gonna have a bruised ego for a couple of days but i'm telling you your ego will be made up by the fact that you did something that was actually really cool and manly asking a girl on a date girls are missing that guys that hold doors or have the strength to ask now on dates and not hidden behind these apps or sending an instagram message i mean just ask her say hey do you want to grab lunch sometime hey do you want to catch a movie sometime and if she says no oh well she's not the one and you'll meet somebody else at home date night idea i love cooking so i always think cooking together is fun my husband is is also a good cook so that's a great thing other than that if we're at home it's usually making dinner and then we love to watch shows together so i know that sounds like i'm an old person because we do like to stay inside a lot more these days we have a son so it's just easier for us to um do a dinner date night okay guys i hope you enjoyed that advice coming from me dating advice i've been out of the game for a little bit and i have a kid but i think there are some good mistakes that i've made from the past that you don't have to make so hope you enjoyed

order for johnny depp for prevailing in his trial against defamation trial against amber heard but more importantly there is a congratulations in order to all of the women like me who for the last words have been four years have stood up to all of the attacks for refusing to back the metoo movement which has been an absolutely idiotic movement from the very beginning and it really just for me it begs out of all of the stupid movements and for all of you people who jump on instagram and twitter looking for something to care about like you treat every social cause like it's an ice bucket challenge like you guys like i don't know like oh thank you for nominating me to care about black lives today i'm going to post a black square well thank you for nominating me to care about ukraine today i'm going to post a ukrainian flag even though i can't even point to it on a map thank you for nominating me to put a mask on and take a picture and say mask up save lives um i'm going to do that because i'm an idiot and i just do whatever i find on instagram that seems to be popular at the moment like to you people who just never think just never suspend yourself for a moment to think right and keep being proven over and over and over again that you're falling for fictitious narratives falling for fictitious organizations lining the pockets of predators and supporting liars because that's what the metoo movement was all about from the very beginning the metoo movement trended with the hashtag believe women okay a bunch of men out of nowhere were getting fired based off of allegations absent anybody ever exploring the details or observing the facts people were just going oh okay a woman said it so we must therefore believe women what believe women hashtag blanket believe women have you maybe you guys live in a place a fairytale land i don't know where women are all wonderfully honest and you didn't grow up with around the same toxic females that i went to middle school in high school i have seen like when it comes to lying women do it in a way that men aren't even capable of i have seen women do the grimiest things to their best friends to their cousins to their sisters like and you want me to just one day pretend that i've never seen a woman do a bad act and just tell me blanket believe women half of the stories that were coming out made entirely no sense i mean amber hurt is the first one but do you understand how many men have been accused of being rapists and abusers that on absolutely meredith meritless claims that actually fail to pass the common sense exam take for example matt lauer right i can't stand that man obviously i'm conservative leaning and i didn't feel bad when anything happened to him because the truth is that matt lauer to me at the end got his karma but the claims of him being a rapist did you look at the details of the story some girl who worked at abc you know decides to sleep with the boss at the olympics she claims he raped her at the olympics but then when they got back from the olympics she proceeded to have a year-long affair with him going all around the city going to his apartment you just decided to date you're a rapist for a year oh but then me too started trending and suddenly she wanted to check from abc and she got the check and that's it blanket just believer that i just i don't know people i guess just start dating their rapists i guess like let's not ask any questions can't stand matt lauer but that's a case that needs to be examined kesha honestly she's number one okay kesha the girl who jumped up in the morning and brushed her teeth with a battle of jack right every one of her songs is about partying suddenly she wants out of her sony contract she accuses dr luke luke of raping her and she's put onto a platform and everyone's like oh my god look at the photo of her crying in the back of the courtroom like obviously she's telling the truth because like she's crying in the back of a courtroom and no woman could ever make this face unless she was telling the truth like how basic are you guys like no proof no evidence nothing just she cried in the back of a courtroom so everyone needed to believe her and then what happened she quietly after getting all this attention performing at the awards oh my gosh she's amazing she quietly dismisses her claims against dr luke because she wanted to just release new music so like yeah no he sexually abused me i got the narrative out there that he sexually abused me but now i'm gonna quietly dismiss my case against him um even though like it definitely happened but i just like i want to move on with my life and i want to release new music and also don't forget i was crying in the back of the courtroom memorizing this [Music] youtube what is wrong with the internet like is are people trying to be stupid on the internet like is you just looking for something to do do you need a hug is that what it is when a hashtag comes around you just need a hug and you're just like i love it it makes me feel good hashtag me too me too was always a movement and yes there were a few exceptions there are women that actually have been raped and sexually assaulted i've always believed rose mcgowan she strikes me as a different kind of person i believe that something happened to her right but for the majority of these people these were crazy women who had an opportunity to empower themselves you had women that had a vengeance and wanted to get back a moment they couldn't they couldn't stand you had women that were at the bottom of their careers who wanted to climb to the top and it worked it worked and so yes amber heard is the first but she should not be the last i hope that dr luke prevails in his case against kesha i hope that that gets re-examined by the press i hope that the matt lauer thing that he sues people i know that he quietly signed an agreement to leave abc and this was more of a corporate decision but you don't i can't stand them you don't just call a man a rapist because you can't stand them that's just not how it works okay prostitution by the way oldest trade in the book suddenly we're acting like there aren't women who are actively sleeping with men because they want i don't know record deals or they want promotions like are we all actually pretending like women are just these innocent little flowers that are walking around society again where did you grow up i would love to believe in that version of womanhood i just want to know where you grew up where you have not seen women do the grimiest shistiest things um ever to get what they want usually to get a guy half the time that i've seen things where i'm just like wow she was just sleeping with her best friend's boyfriend the whole time behind her back but she cried in the back of the courtroom it's very simple men lie women lie right both sexes lie all the time both of them do terrible things you should never blanket believe women you should never blanket believe men you should never blanket believe anything but facts okay when somebody makes an allegation you should demand to see the facts and then you should just do a little common sense test ask yourself if the facts line up if they make any sense you know johnny depp just didn't pass the smell test to me you're telling me you've got a man who's been married for over a decade he's had all of these top you know these girlfriends that are in the public eye and just like at the age of however old he is 50 he decides to become like a crazy abusive person like wouldn't his wife who divorced him divorces are never pretty right wouldn't she be like no there was that one year when he was drunk that like he used to whoop my butt all the time like there was just no one in in the history johnny jeff strikes me as a drunk pirate really honestly i look at him and i think this brand is actually who you might be i totally buy that he wasn't a sober person but a violent person he just was getting away with it forever like i mean just like raping and beating women with bottles and there wasn't a single person that could testify that he put their hands on him like on her like it it just never passed the sniff test you know what i mean and i just am really saying this because i hope that going forward as these various movements collapse like black lives matter and we're seeing now where that money went certainly didn't go to black communities but darn if all your friends didn't post black squares and demand that you do too as we're seeing the death of the metoo movement as we're seeing that all of these little trends like more will come out about ukraine of course we've just obviously laundered money to through ukraine obviously we didn't leave afghanistan and jump into ukraine because our politicians are suddenly caring about eastern europeans right as all of these narratives fall i hope that you pause and you consider the fact that you don't have to jump on a trend like it's actually cool to be an individual you don't have to do what everybody else is doing you do you don't like it's actually super super dope to not do what everybody else is doing it's like you know what i actually don't know anything about that and so i'm gonna keep my mouth shut like maybe you're like me you just like to garden and like i don't know make some soups at home and watch your kids you don't you don't have to post a black square you don't have to use the hashtag me too and if you're a guy and you're going through the profile of a woman and you've noticed that she's both posted like i don't know i love you dr fauci mascot save lives hashtag me too and um a black square don't date her just don't date her red flags for days doesn't have a brain cell that's the last thing i'm gonna say congrats to me and to all the women who never cared and to jump on the trend and could admit that women lied just as much and maybe even more than men do thanks guys bye-bye", "U5oohuE7qBM": "hello hello okay so i'm supposed to be on maternity leave but sometimes every once in a while you just see something that is so egregious and so offensive and i have just had enough out of amy schumer for a while now i mean if there's a picket sign anywhere amy schumer picks it up she just is like i have to be outside screaming about something my life is overprivileged and amazing and i have to be upset but i'm not gonna allow this because i'm going to speak up for black americans this woman got a got a megaphone today and decided to speak out about the roe v wade overturning and had the audacity to correlate to slavery okay this is a hollywood trope almost the white wealthy women in hollywood love to basically say i either get what i want or i'm going to correlate to slavery this is their thing right it's like if i don't get what i want i'm going to say that it's just like slavery or else like it's wrong and i need to get what i want until you give it to me i'm going to use black people i'm going to use the pain of the past i'm going to use racism and i'm going to call something racist that has absolutely nothing to do with grace until i get what i want amy schumer did this today she got on a platform and said that the reversal of roe v wade in the supreme court is exactly what slave holders would have wanted makes entirely no sense obviously abortion did not exist um you know as a clinical service back when slaves were alive um about i mean back back when we had slavery in america pardon and yet she's using this because she's being whiny and she's being bratty and she thinks it's acceptable to harness black pain to get what she wants and this is similar to what we saw during black lives matter tons of money raised none of it went to the black community but damn if every white person didn't put a black score on their profile and find this way to pretend that they understood the struggle of black americans so let's just first off give you a historical lesson if you are today deciding that you want to donate to planned parenthood on the back of what happened today then you need to be told that you are donating to a racist organization okay the history of planned parenthood is never going to change no matter how hard liberals try to obscure it it was created by a woman that hated black americans it was initially called the negro project she put it together because she was a eugenicist and she did not want black americans to procreate not just black americans by the way also people that were from southeast europe that we were getting a ton of immigrants during the progressive era and a bunch of genesis got together and said if these italians and these at the time germans and these people in eastern europe and these black people continue to have babies it's going to dumb down our race in fact the most read book at that time the most popular book at that time was called the passing of the great race it was written by a man named madison grant and it's spelled out um from a scientific perspective science trust the science that unless they did something you were going to be producing a dumber breed of people that the races were going to be dumbed down in came margaret sanger right a progressive yes we a left person who spoke in front of the ku klux klans women's um gathering the wives of the ku klux klans gathering and petitioned for abortion she wanted abortion because she thought this was a good mechanism to get rid of undesirables as she called them undesirables unfit they also included mentally challenged people that were undesirable this was going on at the same time as other extreme measures uh to make sure that black people were not procreating like the mississippi appendectomies where they were telling women that they needed their pet black women that needed their appendix removed and in fact what they were actually doing was making them infertile okay so you have to imagine my surprise when this woman margaret sanger created something so horrid like planned parenthood planned parenthood clinics exists majority in minority communities to this day she has been successful in what she set out to do we know that they have killed more than 18 million black babies we know that the black community black america our population is not going up right now right she has been successful she's she's arguably one of the most successful progressives in history in terms of setting out to what she wanted to do and she's so successful that planned parenthood got into the classrooms in the 1970s and said rather than even hiding obscuring what we're doing we can actually actively teach women to want their abortions to teach poor people to want their abortions to brainwash them planned parenthood began in an effort in the 1970s to get into the school system they're still there this is when sex education classes started okay to teach people that it's their right to get an abortion that they should actually be out there arguing for their own genocide the black population today would be double what it is today if it were not for planned parenthood so consider amy schumer who is getting up on stage saying to people you need to donate to planned parenthood to deal with this because this is exactly what the slaveholders would have wanted a reversal of roe v wade it's so deluded and it's so kooky and it borderlines on mental illness in my opinion because you are relying on black americans to be so stupid about their own history that they should be celebrating the reversal of something that helped you genesis right it is absolutely ridiculous by the way if you are pro-choice and you are still out there saying that i don't want a man to speak for what happens to my uterus okay then you would be celebrating today because seven white men decided on roe v wade there wasn't a single woman who decided i'm roby wade what are you talking about literally what are you saying do you just not like care about history do not study civics do you not even know what roe v wade is are you just kind of watching the cultural arguments are you following your favorite celebrities who are saying my body might are you following miley cyrus eating an abortion cake is that your educational bandwidth for what you know about this issue at all there was like it was decided by seven white men arbitrarily women never got to vote on this or decide on it if you want women to actually have a choice on this then you're going to be happy that the supreme court has sent it back to the states because it's unconstitutional there is nothing in the constitution that enshrines your right to abort a baby how could there be this was created by you genesis this entire program was created by people who did not want other certain people to reproduce right it's it's it's racist in its origins for a thousand different reasons it's not only just racist it's as i said was meant to attack people that were disabled so i just don't know where people get off on these arguments if you are if you're going to be pro-choice be authentic by the way about being pro-choice and how you can be authentic at being pro-choices by acknowledging that the reasons that most girls get abortions is because they're terrified and they're being peer pressured okay my first introduction to abortion a family member of mine got pregnant when she was 16 years old and the entire family she did not want to have an abortion the entire family pressured her to get one okay so so much from my body my choice when in reality there's these are scared kids that are being pressured either from their family members or being threatened from boyfriends who say their lives are going to be ruined and they don't want to take care of a child that is the majority of abortions that are happening i know this i know six people that have had abortions i have another family member who her boyfriend at the time wanted her to get an abortion and he became domestically violent breaking into her home i remember what that night was like how traumatizing it was because he did not want her to have her son and she wanted it these women that are getting abortions are not amy schumer over privilege i just want to like maintain my acting career or whatever it was that michelle williams said these are women that are operating under duress that are terrified because they have teachers that are peer pressuring them an education system that is telling them that they won't be absolutely nothing unless they get an abortion a b they have a threatening boyfriend that's domineering and telling them that they want nothing to do with nothing to do with this kid if you don't get an abortion which is a daunting idea for a woman to be a single mother b or c parents that are peer pressuring them telling up they're going to ruin the rest of their lives that's the majority of abortions these are not there's not majority rape victims okay which is such an extreme argument that you only take because you can't come up with any valid arguments because you know that what your what you're defending this industry that was built by your genesis in this industry that has murdered millions upon millions of innocent children 45 million plus babies that would be alive because you can't defend it so you'd come up with extreme arguments be real if you're going to be pro-choice and you have the audacity to be pro-choice then be real then say it you know then then then say it with some air on your chest say it with some hair on your chest right like get out there and say i am pro-choice i understand it's a baby i understand that it actually is something that is harmful to women i understand that most women that get abortions come out of it emotionally traumatized and are hurt and some of them then become even more radical because they haven't addressed the hurt from their first abortion they don't want to acknowledge what they've done so it's easier for them to pick up a picket sign and go to dc and protest outside of brett kavanaugh's place because they don't acknowledge what they've done admit that that that's the normal circumstance admit that and also admit that these women are just like i was for the 25 plus years that i was pro-choice are brainwashed before they even are able to think or understanding what they're supposed to be as women right but which is nurturing our our spiritual our spiritual bodies our spiritual necessities are to nurture as women it is what makes us so beautiful and so unique like becoming a mother has been the biggest gift to my life i mean as a woman you will be refined by this experience you will be you will you will become a superhero because of this experience all of that is being stripped away because before we even have the ability to grow up we are being brainwashed into a cult because that's what it is i really believe that i was a part of a cult when i was a pro-choice and that cult was designed for me by planned parenthood as soon as i got into school as soon as i got into a sex ed class before i understood anything about the actual science against it i was a i was a cult member that's what it is mostly women are are in a cult and they don't see it because when you're in the cult you don't understand it and when you start to wake up and you realize that it's all lies that it's not a clump of cells that i saw my son's hands and arms moving and ultrasound at seven weeks that i knew his personality when he was sitting in my belly and i was right about his personality and i kept telling my husband exactly who he was when you start understanding the miracle of life how it will soften you how it will enlighten you how it will enrich you how it will refine you you will realize that as a mother nothing is impossible that that that is your superhero you know that is what makes you a superhero anyways i'm ranting because i'm just mortified and also probably a little hormonal just sitting here listening to people be ridiculous in their arguments and and knowing sadly that in liberal states what's going to happen now they're going to pass extreme abortion laws they're going to be like oh well you can now have a abortion when your child's five because that's what they have to do and in conservative states they will ban abortion women will get on a bus and they'll go get one if they want one but what's going to be interesting is the data that comes out of these cities you're going to realize that when women are no longer brainwashed and taught to believe that abortion is just like birth control they will change how they their relationships with men and we have gotten beyond in america we are like no other country on earth in terms of abortion we are actually like north korea when it comes to abortion my husband is english he's mortified when he sees american women he goes i've never seen anything like this women marching in the streets demanding a right it's this is not the way that people even discuss abortion in europe it's it's barbaric what we're doing here in america threatening to kill supreme court justices because you want a right to be able to kill a child listen to what we're saying here like this is not who we are as women this is not what we are meant to be as women this is not as god designed us and you know deep down that that is true and that is the last thing that i will say amy schumer you are just i don't know what to do with you i don't know what to do with you i guess you're you know what you are you are chuck schumer's niece you are chuck schumer's niece girl goodbye", "VSOVDyhBoNI": "I really do believe that modern feminism encourages male absence it encourages it because it's become toxic they use terms like toxic masculinity right and I say to myself all of their examples the idea of what it means to be a man now is toxic they think oh this is a man masculinity is wrong there's something inherently wrong with being a masculine man and to me I always say that it was toxic masculinity that saved me you know I had a healthy fear of my grandfather nobody played around with my grandfather they we still don't play around with my grandfather you know and it's just there's a certain level of respect when you're in his home there are rules and and because I had that healthy fear I I was I guess more responsive to that sort of authority when I had to go out in real life you know I believed in structure and yet this version of feminism today we have women that are basically promoting men should act like women right and women should act like men there's all this confusion you can pick your journey you can do what you want and ultimately what I think it's doing is feeding into this idea of a breakdown of the family", "2K1pS1AGv40": "hey guys it's candace owens here and i will be watching my most viral internet moments with you of all the people that republicans could have selected they picked candace owens i don't know miss owens i'm not going to characterize her i'm going to let her own work he said before he characterized me for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about adolf hitler i agree i actually don't have any problems at all with the word nationalism i think that it gets the definition gets poisoned um my granddad behind me what i don't want so when you think about whenever we say nationalism the first thing people think about in at least in america is hitler you know he was a national socialist among two hours of sleep and i wanted to make germany great this woke me up i flew from la the night before on a red eye so i was literally on charge of sleep miss owens said quote if hitler just wanted to make germany great and have things run well okay fine the problem is that he wanted he had dreams outside of germany so when people try to legitimize adolf hitler does that feed into white nationalist ideology i think it's pretty apparent that uh mr lube believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the full clip in its entirety he purposely presented an extract an extracted clip this will suspend for a moment it is not proper to refer disparagingly or with to a member of the committee uh the witness will not do that again see he wasn't expecting me to be able to respond if it wasn't for guy ruthlessberger saying his last name wrong i always butcher it but he i would have never been able to respond to him and that's how they play in congress they game the system you didn't listen to what i said may i continue please as i said he is assuming that black people will not go pursue the full two-hour clip and he such a coward extracted he cut off and you didn't hear the question that was asked of me he's trying to present as if i was launching a defense of hitler in germany when in fact the question that was asked of me was returning to whether or not i believed that hitler was a whether or not i believed in nationalism and that nationalism was bad and what i responded to was that i do not believe that we should be characterizing hitler yeah what a jerk i mean that was incredible but i remember i was just boiling as i was like i'm not gonna be able to respond to this because he knew exactly what he was doing he knew that he could use all of his times whenever he wanted he wasn't expecting me to be able to respond unfortunately for me guy walks in and he a lot allows me to respond and ted lou wasn't expecting that but i just remember i i was so angry my hands were shaking i had my granddad behind me my husband behind me and i was texting my husband after he went and i was just like i'm not going to respond with me to respond i it took everything in me not to like stand up and shout but fortunately i was rescued and i was able to respond and we created this viral moment which i was not expecting that was my first time testifying in front of congress i didn't know what to expect but i did not expect for the democrats to be i guess just so machiavellian and trying to strategize to paint someone as something that they're not and then not even giving them a decency to respond to it in the end he got what he deserved a viral moment uh showing him to be the jerk that he is i mean it just it's a bizarre thing to be characterized as a a hitler supporter i'm black i mean it doesn't make sense it's just so ridiculous but you know ted lou is a slime ball and so he was going to try to get away with what he got away with and so it went viral everywhere i mean it was literally by the time i left there it was going so viral i was shocked i've never i had never seen a c-span clip go viral um it was genuinely everywhere or your or any of your brothers or any of your family members if they are caught out there by a policeman who is in a covert undercover white supremacist and get gunned down this constituency will have absolutely nothing to say about that please let me ask you these questions please let me ask you this question and we can't and although what you're saying is abs a lot of the things that you're saying are absolutely factual a lot of the things that you're saying have merit but i can't even get to that before i address i will address it right now i'll address it right i love it i love this question i will address it zones i love that we're talking about white supremacy i've been watching this i just ti gets me so angry i want to talk about why we get manipulated i'm being serious guys i'm not even trying to make this like a contentious moment because this is literally why black america loses right here because we allow people with cameras to go hear a whole speech like they do this to me all the time they take out a couple of sentences you said and they create a whole new headline and people that were not there get in sense and get emotional and don't actually go back to hear what was actually said in full context they do it to me all the time i know they do to trump he has denounced white supremacy so many times he it's something north somebody counted up 24 times and it's on his twitter feed so if you want to fact check me go back to a couple of weeks ago when the shootings happened he said america is no place for white nationalism and white supremacy and it's issue that has to be tackled i'm paraphrasing you can go find out let me tell you why the black vote is the easiest vote for democrats to keep for the last 60 years let me tell you something if people know what you fear you are the easiest person to control the democrats have figured out that black america is emotionally responsive to the word racism she says racism you jump up and you start cheering you haven't even listened to what i've said to rebut it okay i do not consider myself a republican i do not i definitely am not a democrat but trump woke me up i used to be liberal trump woke me up to the idea that we're being manipulated by the word racism every four years that aged well i think there were a bunch of elements of this clip that were taken and it kind of turned into the ti versus candace thing and which i think is a shame because actually if you look at the comments the people that actually watched the panel especially people that were in the audience were really happy with the panel because i don't think they had ever heard me speak and i kept people kept coming out to me after being like why don't you say this stuff that you said on stage like everywhere else and i'm like i literally do you just never get to hear anything i say because people always parse out um just one element of it but t.i was the most frustrating person because he is so fake i cannot even tell you so i met ti because kanye introduced us he i don't know how he gave i think he gave me ti's number we talked on the phone before this panel tni has probably spoken on the phone like six or seven times and the opinion of everything that he gave me on the phone is so different than the ti that showed up on stage that day so he's a true entertainer so when he gets on stage he's gonna say whatever he thinks he needs to say to get people to get hyped whereas everyone else in the panel despite how much you disagree with them on they were extremely authentic like especially killer mike who i still talk to today he's like such an authentic guy even sneaking mallory who i like am adamantly opposed to she was super respectful and really nice and genuine like she was she was being genuine t.i came there to entertain and um you know he's super ignorant but he's just also he's two-faced right so that was the most frustrating part of the panel was that t.i was just being so two-facing next to me trying to get the the audience hyped and against me and i was just like this is not the same ti if he gets the phone with kanye he's like oh yeah man i understand it's funny it's like oh yeah i totally understand and then he gets from the audience he doesn't care about what he said it's all about what is going to make the audience be hyped and hear my point so he sucks and more than sucking though is that he got his perfect karma because now t.i is under investigation him and his wife are under investigation for a bunch of like horrible sex crimes and i don't doubt it he's actually very disrespectful and denigrating to women in general and you kind of see that side of him when you spend a little more one-on-one time with him but overall i was really very very happy i mean did he was sitting in the front row with the panel i think there needs to be more of it and people are always like why don't you do more events like this i'm like when i'm invited i always go i think we should always go into rooms people think they disagree with you because that's when you transform the most minds and without question so many minds are in the room that day i would love to be invited to another revolt summit and i staying touched a lot of people that were that are on that stage even still today not ti do you want to be a hero for the holidays how about getting your loved one a new iphone that's right puretalk has iphone 12s starting at just 479 dollars

owens puretalk is simply smarter wireless some restrictions may apply see save aside for details honestly i don't think it would have been fiery if ti wasn't on stage like doing so much shouting i was told it was a political summit i knew he was gonna be on the panel so i knew that we had different perspectives i would say killer mike is probably somewhere in the middle like he's just kind of he's just like a very kind person even though he has some socialist beliefs i don't know where he comes out you know comes out of left field with you know i i knew where they all staged there were no surprises like i obviously knew that i was going to be like the token conservative and i was fine with that because i think i mean i believe what i believe so i believe that on any stage and i'm on anywhere um and i i have the facts on my side so i'm never um scared or embarrassed to go on to issue but i disagree with me i just have to say that i object strenuously to your use of the worst object strenuously i strenuously object sounds like it hurts you're of course not responsible for the words of somebody writing that document but i do think that laughing at it is a reality i instantly seem to point out the fact that this was a hearing on the rise of white supremacy and i am the only black person that was invited to speak on this this is incredible democrats just don't even it's like they're like black people are suffering so we're going to call in a bunch of white experts talk about how black people are suffering and then all three of them proceed to lecture me on my own suffering but telling me that they're like you know i have a phd in white supremacy and i know that you are suffering and you're not understanding well i've got you know i'm a doctor in white supremacy and you are not understanding the diagnosis that you are suffering as a black person i mean it's like the person that never stops going to college that person like they really think that you can just learn something in college and that's it so like they've learned what it means to be black and they just need to help this poor black person sit next to them understands what she's living through as opposed to maybe asking me okay and mr clay so we have two members who have not so i'm gonna go to the two members who have not yet i'd also like to point out again talking about their tricks in congress this is the end of the hearing so every single congressman got to speak and this is how they run their game so jamie raskin who was chairing this committee was like great goody all the republicans have gone and now it's just me and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna end i'm gonna end this hearing by allowing all of these white people to turn and yell at candace and then i'm gonna say hearing concluded so this is once again setting me up to essentially not be able to respond which is just so vicious it infuriates me so there were no republicans in the room before a literal hail mary happened um in the form of mark meadows to respond for a second i'll yield thank you uh i believe miss owens when you used the word hilarious it was in it was referencing the fact that no one had asked you a question it wasn't to the subject matter of the hearing is that right that is correct and for to have another witness insinuate something that is not accurate is just not appropriate mr chairman for how witnesses are supposed to behave in front of this committee i also think you didn't say it doesn't matter about the subject matter of today's hearing you said there are other subjects that matter as well and maybe we should so mark meadows had walked in and he was like shocked at what he was seeing and he was like take all my time and i've said that i said that in my opening and i will say it again you know that white supremacy and white nationalism is nowhere near ranks nowhere near the top of the issues that are facing black america and the reason that you are bringing them up in this room is because it is attempt to make the election all about race as the democrats not in my case i'm sorry please do not characterize my motive mr chairman it's my time it's my time you've got your time mr meadows i'll give you three more seconds every four years you bring up race and you knew exactly what i meant when i said hilarious and you just tried to do live what the media does all the time to republicans to our president and to conservatives would you try to manipulate what i said to fit your narrative okay i was not referring to the subject matter that is hilarious i said it's hilarious that we are sitting in this room today and i've got two doctors and a misses and nobody can give us real numbers that we can respond to so we can assess how big of a threat this is because you know that it is not as big of a threat as you are trying to make it out to be so you can manipulate yeah i crushed that i was so mad i was so mad i was just like just the idea of lecturing someone how to be black it just i don't understand like how could you just be so removed from reality that you think having a phd in white supremacy allows you to lecture someone on what they're going through it's just it's totally bonkers but it happened and that was the last time dr kathy baloo probably lectured a black person on being black in america ever again such a meaningless degree by the way how do you get a degree in white supremacy doesn't make sense like you know just none of it makes any sense she's got a phd in white supremacy what does it even mean done the exact same thing every four years ahead of an election cycle and it needs to stop actually the best part about this entire clip is the face that jim jordan makes afterwards when he realizes that it was a hail mary and after i finished speaking he just like does this like warm fuzzy christmas smile that's so good he's just like hahaha jamie raskin it was a good day it was a bad moment like i wanted to actually strangle someone but it was a good day because i think it really exposed them for you know what they are so in my opinion uh george floyd was a criminal he was a criminal and just because he was a criminal doesn't mean i'd like to strike the record not my opinion definitely a fact doesn't mean that i am not going to play a part of the broken black culture that always wants to martyr criminals why are we pretending that this criminal should be upheld as a citizen of as a martyr in black america so this entire narrative is complete smoke and mirrors it's all made up it's just election fodder it's white versus black because it's an election year not because black americans are suffering at the hands of police officers more than white americans candace owen that rotten she's the worst i can't think of a worse way to make money she's most articulate i didn't make money on that video she's so articulate she tell you how stupid she is precisely they killed him and that wasn't right so he's the guy we're not desperate for heroes in the black community anything that survives this nightmare is my god damned hero so first and foremost that video i'm it's still you know is number one most viral video i've ever done which shocked me i mean it was such a casual thing i was sitting up there talking to my husband outside in dc and i was just like i can't even stand this anymore it's a bizarre thing to me because i've grown up with uncles are addicted to drugs it's very weird to me to try to turn somebody who is a drug addict turn somebody who is a criminal into a martyr it's very weird that there are murals and statues erected of george floyd at the same time that they're like they're fighting having a statue erected of clarence thomas it is really a symptom of how cancerous the black community has become so i'm talking about isn't it about it i'm just like this is ridiculous i'm not gonna allow this lie to make its way around the world and i just ranted literally i was sitting on the floor in our guest bedroom and i just ranted uh you know felt like it was a blink went upstairs i think i took a nap and the video went viral as an understatement 100 million views it was insane it was everywhere people contacting me from turkey from the uk from australia i mean celebrities everywhere were contacting me and the number one time it was thank you because they had actually bought into the media narrative because they were just seeing every night this is what's happening to black men in america was happening with black men and nobody had talked about the fact that this guy was a career criminal it's very hard to get arrested nine times you know to spend nine times in jail and in prison before you turn 40. like that is the one remarkable thing that george floyd did is that he was able to spend that much time in prison before he even turned 40. this man was a drug addict i mean he died of drug overdose everyone watched he didn't he did you know he was obviously having a drug overdose you know what role derrick chovin played and not stopping or getting him the help he needed um is can be a matter of debate but there's no question that you i mean fentanyl in your system 50 times 50 to 100 times more deadly than morphine nobody wants to talk about that stuff so i just wasn't gonna allow that narrative to get out um because it says at the end of the day it's just harmful it's a harmful thing to have black americans conditioned to think that every time one of your criminals dies you need to go protest and boycott for them this would never happen any other community not the jewish community when's the last march for a jewish criminal that you remember what about asian it was a lot last march for an asian criminal it doesn't happen it's just our community and it's because we have people like dave chappelle making you think that in order to prove that you're a real person and again i never i allowed i allowed dave schuspell to say what he said because i think that there does need to be a protected space for comedy um but if we're really getting at what he's implying here it's that you know it's incumbent upon every black person to defend their criminals i am just i believe the exact opposite if you are a criminal nothing to do with you if you really care about black lives and you will address the fact that this man tortured black americans entire life he spread drugs in the black community he you know was arrested for attacking a woman who had a small child uh forcing his way into her home um you know with a gun and and spent real time in prison for these things so i don't care what race you are if you're a criminal i have no time for you um i have absolutely no time for george floyd i've never edited my opinion that once um again that is that remains exclusive to my opinion on derek shoving i'm talking strictly about george floyd he was a career criminal career drug addict and he died committing crime and doing drugs so i'm just i'm candace 24 7 365 and sometimes it picks up and it goes viral but um i've never once regretted anything that's been viral internet i i say what i say and i mean it also it was kind of cool to have dave chappelle who's like one of the most famous comedians ever mentioned me so i mean that's influentai", "q1H4JmPvXBs": "hey guys it's candice owens we're gonna have some fun today because i'm going to be reading mean tweets and trust me there are a lot of them candace owns the queen of denouncing liberal identity politics and then playing victim when people call out her white supremacist talking points and claiming it's because they're racist what a effing hypocritical clown i just want to be clear that the person who's saying that i play victim is literally the guy who has made a name for himself after a school shooting so cameron caskey i'm not going to take that to heart also i always think it's weird when it's a white person calling me a racist i don't know if a person thinks that's weird but i think it's a little weird from tony candice owens blocked me when i called her a gigantic hole two years ago and i see she is trending but i can't see why so i'm just going to assume it's because she's a gigantic [\u00a0__\u00a0] you were right i was trending because i am a gigantic what that's actually objectively funny so i'm gonna give you credit for that tony that's a good one i can see why candace owens is so confused says pam keith esquire she is one truly unaccomplished college dropout who got attention from yiannopoulos and cernovich for attacking liberals in quotation marks in a doxing dispute she became a conservative overnight now racist pay her to validate their racist views see i feel like that's just not like funny or clever and it's just like pam keith from florida needs attention and she tweets this um okay pam keith esquire i feel like the esquire you have something a bit more clever going on but at least you finished college so we should assume that you're smart question is does candace owens realize white nationalist kyle rainhouse would be shooting at her if his ar-15 rifle was not in wisconsin police custody question is does joey putin know that kyle rittenhouse literally killed only white people if he's a white supremacist or a white nationalist he sure sucks at it right wingers saying canis owens should be on the supreme court is a hundred percent proof that they drink their own piss okay okay amy a hundred percent you caught them exactly that's right and what is sonia sotomayor proof of what are you guys drinking we're concerned oh gosh this is going to be hard mean tweet because i'm going to have to try to read it and that's the hardest part of this mean to it's mean to make me try to read this tweet but i'm going to go for it cardi b yes you are right i have the number one song and i have a huge platform and i can make millions go vote to get the man that used you why would people be voting for the man that used me i don't want to argue with you candace i really don't have the time i honestly just feel sorry for you you really don't have the punctuation cardi to be arguing with me on twitter that sentence makes no sense you're saying i can make millions go vote to get the man that used you people don't vote to get somebody um i don't know what else to say other than i really really feel sorry that you do not have the punctuation of a third grader or the grammar of a third grader but hey i like some of your music let's just be friends cardi let's just be friends candace owens isn't qualified enough to pick up my glad i'm very sad that i will not be able to pick up your dog's poop um i guess i'll try to get a different job other than having to pick up your dog's poop and i'm glad that you are qualified to pick up your dog's poop when racists say i have black friends they mean candace owens i have seen that so many times copy and pasted it just is such an unoriginal thought um okay that's just cool this is from marlo gosh marlow hates me this is he's from the daily beast he's like one of those people that i've really gotten under his skin and he just perpetually mean tweets me the most that he can and he does not know how to use um a capital letter for first names last name so we've got candace owens claims she's going after christine because she cares deeply about suicide when she openly mocked meghan markle for having suicidal ideations and kurt cobain for taking his own life did not openly mock either of them um meghan markle claimed that she was suicidal as a princess which is um interesting to say elise i think we're kind of living in a culture where people that have the most privilege want you to feel bad for them which is just ridiculous they have everything available to them she's wearing blood diamonds literally to her wedding and she wants you to think that that was a terrible life and i'm just really tired of over privileged people doing that kurt cobain i didn't mock i just said that he's not someone people should idolize i think that's a pretty fair point i don't think that somebody who was a drug addict who eventually killed himself is somebody that we should be aspiring to um when they use example of idols of men that wear dresses they say kirk cobain wore dresses i would like to remind people that he didn't have a fantastic life he ended his life and he was a drug addict might be relevant some american guy says get this anti-american propaganda off my feed hey you can literally hit unfollow that's all you gotta do unfollow you don't have to tweet it you don't have to spare any letters just unfollow me let's be fine she believes trump's lies and malone distorts the truth um dr malone and i did not talk about trump even one second of the four hour interview so i don't know where you're at james weir but maybe when i watch the interview and learn something garbage i mean okay i'm gonna take that i'm just gonna take that straight to the face candace owens was outraged that minnie mouse would wear a pantsuit while wearing a pantsuit i loved this random attempt to try to get me on something jessie waters for those who have not seen a show is always having fun and we were having a good time mocking the outrage of people that felt that minnie mouse needed to be changed in the first place it's ridiculous nobody cares if minnie mouse is wearing a dress and then they tried to make it seem like i cared that she was wearing a pants too it's like no you're the one that changed your outfit you care you're not gonna put this on me you're the one that cares what minnie mouse is wearing and it's weird it's weird and creepy leave minnie mouse alone i like her and i liked her polka dot dress she made that a cool thing oh did minnie mouse tweet me oh minnie mouse tweeted me oh candace always made the wrong enemy it's like that's funny like that's actually funny i like when liberals are funny well gosh i don't want to feel this sick burn but i'm going to read it anyways it's going to be a sick burn candace owens attacks me for wearing a pantsu and that's okay but tell me this why does the far right try to tear down characters like big bird in me oh gosh this is sad the far rights waging a culture war and i'm committed to not letting them win retweet and follow me as i expose them i will retweet and follow you minnie mouse and minnie mouse's suit i think this is this is this is powerful you're amazing i love you and i'm sorry that i'm a far right person trying to tear you down wear the suit mini candace owens dropped out of college she doesn't have a degree let alone a law degree she doesn't have credits to be a substitute teacher eating butter biscuits and being a white supremacy apologists are not the skill sets for supreme court justice more like corchester okay question what's wrong with buttered biscuits literally nothing so you lose bishop college dropout candace owens adamantly believes the moon landing was fake stay in school kids yeah that's really good to take a joke thread that we were talking about funny conspiracy theories and trying to turn it into something else but i don't know i always feel like when i tweets like this i just sense like a desperation to get me anything like we were talking about minnie mouse and the moon landing it's like come on guys just make something funny i appreciate a good joke i like a mean tweet but it's gotta be something that actually stings or is funny this is not i know you you don't have kids stop lying that's that's actually just scary that's not a means that's a scary tweet tony wrong who is he's talking about kyle kashuv or me and he's just saying i don't have kids and i'm lying that's really weird and we should find out who operates that account it is my child he's my child i birthed him i do have a child leave me alone and you don't know me that's even weirder whatever you say ms information i'm happy to be ms information i prefer to be mrs because i am married but i will be misinformation no not candace owens trending during black history month i did not wake up to allow this violence on the timeline be gone demon i think it's pretty clever that's funny i didn't see that retweeted that i'm sorry tanya that's objectively funny andrew kimmel says as if you need another video to prove candace owens lacks any intelligence to be taken seriously here she is on joe rogan he's swinging this 2021 i think this interview is from four years ago talking about how she believes climate change isn't real good on roguing for pressing her yeah no i'm gonna go ahead with climate change is a scam and they change the well climate change is real climate changes honestly seasonally but it's a total scam that kids are freaked out about and every generation has their climate disaster that never comes mine was global warming people before me were global cooling there was the ozone layer there was acid rain and the acidic oceans it literally never ever ever comes true but they raised billions of dollars in the process the ipcc is a total scam organization governments are stealing from you wake up kids you're not going to die candace owens can [\u00a0__\u00a0] the [\u00a0__\u00a0] off that is a potty mouth that is not a nice thing to say to somebody you need to clean up your language i have a swear jar at home you need one at your house black people wouldn't vote for candace owen for office the disabled community wouldn't vote for madison cawthorne i'm lgbtq but i won't be voting for caitlyn jenner just so we're clear i'm so glad we're clear george we will come back to you and consult you on any other questions that we have pertaining to who everybody in america will vote for people probably vote for candace owens candace owen i met her and she is a disaster and i wouldn't vote for her not definitely not getting my vote so i agree with george all right guys that's it for bean tweets honestly if they're good i laugh and they're funny be funnier i want everyone to be funnier and be meaner", "w85UrcCU7x4": "you guys can get degrees now i looked it up latin x study first off what the hell is latinx you can get a major in gender studies that should be pretty easy there's only two that should take a class maybe five minutes you've got women's studies there was like a course called social justice and civic responsibility i don't even know what that means or why you can get a major in that but i do know but if you do get a major in that you are not going to make any money in life because it's not a real major it's made up and the kids don't know this so it to me i feel bad when i come across you know college students because there's propaganda you're learning that this is real this is reality and then you're going to get out into the real world after saying i took gender studies for four years you're going to realize there's not a job for that there's not a way for you to make money and what that creates then is a bitter angry person because you go but i've got six degrees and why is this idiot kid talking about you know the rest of america who went to a trade school didn't rack up any debt and is making more money than me fixing air conditioners because he actually knows something", "xKbtmmR0tEY": "okay guys i have no idea why but apparently you really liked me giving you dating advice in previous videos so i'm going to follow up by answering more of your questions about the dating sphere so let's jump right into it [Music] first question how do i tell a guy that i'm waiting until marriage to have sex that's from molly i would say you just tell him just like that you just say it i feel like when i was growing up that would have been a super weird conversation because it used to be the scenario that a woman taking her clothes off was like oh my gosh that's people don't normally do that and guys were super attracted to girls that took their clothes off now it's just so available everywhere like it's just every girl is taking their clothes off for attention that i think men today would find it to be really interesting and cool and different to be the kind of girl that keeps her clothes on so i think don't overthink it just say it and if he finds it to be at all weird or it's not what he's looking for then take it as you dodging a bullet next question what are some red flags people don't really know to look for okay i'm not sure if the person asking this question is a guy or a girl so i will give you some a red flag for guys and a red flag for girls so if you are dating a girl i would say a red flag is if she says she's a feminist um and i'm assuming we're talking about younger people but and or she has that whole thing about like oh don't open the door for me or i don't need you to do that like i don't cook and she kind of like denigrates femininity that's just long term going to be a really big problem i think when guys are looking at women they should be looking at the kind of young women that could potentially grow up one day to raise their children and trust me when i tell you that a woman that is trying to constantly be you and constantly be masculine all the time is not going to be the person that you want raising your children into the future so i always say young feminists are a red flag and they also shriek louder than anybody i know if you are a young lady a red flag to look out for with men something that i caught on with later are guys that can't do anything for themselves and they have to call their moms for everything like basic things like booking a flight i don't know how to do that my mom does it for me or like my mom normally does that you will find in a relationship that a lot of guys are kind of looking for women to be their mothers later in life and it's just super unattractive and time consuming like i always say that a policy that women should have would be that you want to date a man before you date your son because that's what it will feel like eventually feel like you're raising a child rather than dating somebody that will eventually be a partner in your life so no babies it's obviously great call your mom have a great relationship with your mom those are good things but need my mom to you know pick my classes in college and go through the catalog or i need my mom to pay off my like ten dollars on my credit card bill i don't know how to log into my own account that stuff is super lame so look out for that red flag it means he's a toddler next question should i date a liberal if he's hot lol if you want to i hope he's got some other qualities going for him should you date anybody just because they're hot would probably be a better question and the answer would be no i would go for personality doesn't really matter if he's liberal that all liberals are bad people often say that if you're not a liberal when you're young you don't have a heart if you're not conservative when you're older you don't have a brain you know being a liberal is kind of the default setting it's like getting your iphone the factory settings are liberal you know and so it doesn't mean anything but i would definitely say perhaps dig a little deeper than just what he looks like next question 28 29 year old couple dating for two and a half years i'm ready for him to propose tips to get him to i would say emily and you might not like this advice but i am strongly opposed to women trying to kind of egg men to do that i've seen that before where women really stress themselves out and they're trying to get a man to propose and i always just say like don't you want the man to want to propose without having the idea put into his head i think the best relationships are the one where both people are just so excited about the prospect of their future that that all falls into place naturally it's okay to say to any person that you're dating like i want to be married i hope that we're on the same footing that you know we're looking at marriage in the future but i don't think that you want to peer pressure anyone into giving you a ring i just don't think that long term that works it's not like if you force one into marriage your relationship's magically going to get better or it's going to be sprinkles and rainbows and glitter and whatever else is shiny is there a particular age that you think is ideal to have kids no i don't think there's an ideal age but i do think there are ideal circumstances i think it's good to have a job it is good to have a place to live and it is good to be able to create a home and environment that provides stability for that child and a lot of people think about that stuff after the fact and i think it's super unfair to children to grow up in unstable environments and in a relationship i mean under a relationship where their parents kind of just got married because they had a kid or mom just got pregnant because she thought it would fix the relationship or or you know vice versa whatever it is so it's all about the environment if there's a stable environment then the more kids the merrier next question if my boyfriend is hesitant for me to meet his family is this a red flag yes it is it's a huge red flag um it it signal it should signal to you that he is not as serious about the relationship as you may be uh for a guy taking you home to mom and dad is a very big deal because what it signals to his parents is i'm very serious about um this young woman and if he's declining to do so it's because he's got a few question marks in the back of his head or his parents are completely psychopathic either way it's a red flag so steer clear next question how do you talk to your significant other if you find out they've been cheating on you my recommendation is you don't i have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to cheating i just think it is the most disrespectful thing that anyone can ever do it takes five seconds to send a text and say sorry i don't want to be in this relationship um and i think that the hurt that people put one another through because of a moment where they just refuse to do that and don't want to have that tough conversation is just so disrespectful i think if they couldn't honor you with the respect of at least breaking up with you then you certainly don't have to honor them with the with the conversation i had that happen to me once when i was in high school and i am not kidding he was my full fledged boyfriend i didn't even pick up the phone didn't speak to that person for three years and i think it was one of the most empowering things i've ever done in my life even though i was a wreck about it and i was crying at home i never honored him with a conversation about it so that would be my advice next question what should i do if i'm 18 and i've never had a boyfriend that's great i love that i think it's you don't have to have a boyfriend before you're 18. there's no reason to feel pressure about that if it's you if you're saying that you want to be in a relationship it's a it's a very different world now um but i would say just go out and be social i'm kind of against all of the apps i think it's sort of completely denigrates people in a way it kind of reduces us to what we look like and people are becoming more and more anti-social even though they believe they are social because they're on apps so i would say you know go out with your friends head out to a restaurant go out wherever people are hanging out on the weekends and try to meet somebody naturally if that's what you're looking for but if you're just going oh i'm 18 i should have had a boyfriend that's not a good enough excuse to have a boyfriend 18 is really young not many people that i know meets the person that they're going to be with forever when they're 18 years old i know that i certainly didn't next question should more men approach women more often your thought yes absolutely assuming that this person is not some weird hyper feminist and modern feminist i should say hyper modern feminist and sees it as a threatened attack i think actually what we've created is a society of women who are so exasperated with the fact that no men are being men and stepping up to the plate um to ask us out on dates and the reason is because you have a bunch of women that have signaled that oh no it's not okay and everything is a toxic culture and toxic masculinity i'm pro bring back uh masculinity full stop i don't find it to be toxic at all i think there's nothing more wonderful than the tradition of men asking women out for dates men holding doors men pulling out chairs men putting a jacket over a woman's shoulder i am number one cheerleader for all of that so yes yes yes yes next question thoughts on online dating i kind of already answered this in a previous question i think it's horrible i think it reduces everyone to how they look and i also think worst of all is it's giving everybody relationship add it's really interesting it's something that me and my husband have talked about a lot because he's not on social media at all and he often he talks about that lack of focus when you think about your grandparents you think how are they married for 72 years well they weren't able to refresh and look at different women and to develop these unrealistic beauty standards of not realizing that you know women age you're not you're constantly unintentionally shopping and seeing a younger version every time that you refresh your page and i think it's leading to the death of relationships and it's also making people massively unhappy because it's impossible to live up to those sorts of standards so less phone time more getting the zone time face to face last question any advice or words of wisdom for long-distance relationships obviously i am the right person to ask this to because my husband is from england we met in england while i was giving a speech we got engaged two weeks later and now we are happily married so my advice to you would be that where there is a will there is a way where there is love there is a way and if it's meant to be it will fall together without you even having to put any thought into it that's just the way the world works so good luck to you and that is it guys that's a wrap on more unsolicited dating advice from me because for some reason you guys keep soliciting it", "H-GiGUODoQY": "i see people who have whose country has been ravaged by atrocity after atrocity earthquakes hurricanes the clintons like these these people are hopeless and they are trying to make it to the land of opportunity i'm not having a whole debate but as a christian i feel compassion for those people the imagery when it first hit looked terrible right now even looking at this it does evoke like i would love for you all to look up a study by the american psychology association about racial trauma right because it's really a thing and it has a similar effect as ptsd any soldiers out there you might know what i'm talking about but pete with that ptsd looking at this it makes me think about slavery now they came out with the the and i'm gonna finish quick with respect um the story about the whips i was like wow this is effing horrible right but i see people in a really destitute 15 000 people who are starving who are just seeking a better opportunity and i see them being exploited by the media by this administration listen when the mexicans were at the border and trump was in office all of these same democrats aoc pelosi schumer they all ran to the border right trump is the worst person in the world but i was stan the one standing up in the dark the lone voice saying obama's immigration policies were atrocious trump's doing the same thing now biden's doing it all again all over again and flip-flopping camela two months ago said i can't do anything about immigration it's out of my hands it's too much to handle the the fact of the matter is democrats nor republicans have figured out i immigration say i would say yeah well we didn't have this going on when trump was president though obviously the numbers that are coming in right now are like nothing we've ever seen before um and i think a wall would work but also maybe not because they're taking flights yeah why do you think they're coming now what those haitians weren't there there were thousands coming to the border when trump was president like people come to america we did not have a certain come to america most of the people here we realized we did not have a surge of hate showing up at our border when trump was president so i'm just asking a question why do you think they're coming now you know what the world is in a destitute place we were ravaged by kovitt whether you believe in covet or not econ the economy was shut down there's been a lot of problems like america has a problem with black migrants with migrants of color when it was when they were rounding people up i didn't see one russian person in handcuffs like when we had the raids in new york when i used to have to go to make sure that ice wasn't beating the crap out of people it wasn't in white neighborhoods so you mean to tell me sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry illegally america has a problem with black immigrants are you incl or brown immigrants what are you saying i want to get this straight from you well i don't know are you including mexicans yes do you know what they account for over 50 of all of our immigrants we have a problem with over 50 of all of our immigrants but what about the asian immigrants well they can't run over the border so they actually come in legally so they're pretty far wait wait wait wait we we've been here before yeah we've been here before how many there are two borders people sneak into this country of all walks of life stop making just how many how many illegal asian immigrants do you think we have in america give people the truth i'm telling you the truth everybody comes into the country and democrats and republicans alike make these these these exploitative uh mockeries of immigration by just pointing to the ones who are of color who are politically poignant listen can immigrants come here legally no no this is just not true hulk i can't just let you say something just makes no sense african immigrants come here legally asian immigrants come here legally uh they're separated by ocean so yes that's the reason why i'm here illegally as well but not not in the issue that we have right now not in a search yes there are some yes there are some illegal african immigrants there aren't 200 000 at the border trying to come in okay that just is not what's happening be realistic the illegal immigration problem is almost exclusively a problem that's happening at the south of the border you paint with these wide brushes and you deny people the truth you're not painting with yourself to everybody who's watching stop listening to people on tv and read an effing book okay google let me just figure these things out three times let me jump let me jump in listen listen i thought let's talk about black authors who i read like i'm a huge fan of james baldwin like just because i don't read what you thank you you can clap you can clap it's all right it's a right to be an alone person in the majority it's really okay it's real especially when people are trying to suppress your thoughts nobody is suppressing your thoughts i'm i'm suppressing what is actually incorrect and i'm correcting it and you're getting upset when i correct it with an actual book you say that book is not good enough and then when i correct it with an actual fact you say go read a book this is very simple we have immigration laws it's very simple if you want to come come to a port of entry nobody gets rejected at a port of entry you go through a proceeding now if you go under the fence you go over the fence you start getting caught out in on the real grand yeah you're going to get detained it's very simple it's very simple we can work on some of our immigration laws but we do allow more immigrants in our country than any other country in the world millions in here legally yeah and the overwhelming majority are immigrants of color so i'm slapping down your lie that we're somehow oh here's let's let's go from the immigrants that we're accepting no but you stopped talking when she talked that's what i'm saying you've been talking for like you got a whole show going ahead let me i'm just gonna say this it's like a breath of fresh air to some when we talk when we talk about racism and you talk about the bias against people of color i mean the border patrol agents are 60 hispanic so most of the border patrol are people of color in the first place so i don't believe in the racism that you are portraying when i look at what happens um with all seeing them running to the border when it was when trump was in office because they were trying to draw attention to make trump look bad now they don't want to go to the border because they don't want you to know what's happening you're talking about 15 000 people not only have they came over here illegally not only have they breached and and pretty much invaded our country they do not have satisfactory conditions that they're living in we cannot offer them proper food we cannot offer them proper housing we cannot offer them safety and the reason why they're going to do that the reason why they're coming here is because our administration is pretty much telling them it's an open border you come here you get in you have amnesty this is that is the reason why they are coming here and putting their lives on i'm with you right i'm with you like listen listen to what i'm saying listen to what i think that was like 40 seconds right there i did that okay i'm gonna do it real quick i'm gonna do it real quick no he's not as a christian no he's not probably won't right as a christian like a black person as a christian if people are fleeing political persecution they're fluent fleeing a a country ravaged and devastated i have a heart i care about people now if you want to talk about this country the the the the um the the democrats saying hey it's an open border it's a lie bro okay listen to what i'm saying so what i'm saying this is why i can't finish in 47 no i don't understand listen you're saying they're encouraging them seeing them that it's open what i'm saying is a lot of the problem is the problem is what they what politicians say to you and what they actually do is not a new concept this american is apple pie so they're saying yes when trump is in office come come come now they're in power they're like stop i can't do anything for you like i'm not here to argue politics i just love people yeah i also want to say that to that point earlier that you said about ptsd what did you say post black syndrome or something which is like people in the middle of racial trauma racial trauma and you said when you saw these whips for you know same with slavery what you said is akin to ptsd of people that were in the military and you said it's a similar thing that you experienced when you when you at first thought that people were being whipped the haitians were being wet imagery has an effect imagery has an effect i do want to also say just like out of respect to the military men that have ptsd they actually served in the war you were not actually a slave i find that to be a bit effective wait wait wait wait wait wait wait no no no no i want to say absolutely who has mental issues you bash people with mental illness that's what you do and you just kind of try the story here you bash people who have mental illness so of course you would well yes you know what i think it is if you think that you're suffering from ptsd from slavery you've never been a slave i'm not bashing you i'm just calling it out after that ptsd do not correlate it to the military men who are suffering from something they actually experience", "UxnpQZ12fVA": "i'm i'm very against technology i think it's it's ruining children when you look at these girls and they're getting their lips and their butts done and they're like 12. my gosh no are you crazy okay what'd you say he said when you're 18 i like all natural i thought make the girls debate and when they're getting right they look so much so much full of [\u00a0__\u00a0] at all you are probably full of it i'm not at all no no not at all i just literally like a girl that's all natural they just it actually turns me off to be honest like fake tits and like the lips are the worst the white girls on

terrible yeah and then it like deflates a little bit and then like one side's higher than the other and i'm like why did you do this to yourself why did you beat yourself up i don't understand it you've never gotten any work done yourself no work all night no work all natural beautiful yeah i don't i mean i never say never like maybe when i'm after i've had like four kids and uh but i'm not touching my face um but yeah i agree i think i think girls look more beautiful covered up i think girls look more beautiful with their natural faces i don't understand this new trend and it's alarming to me how young the girls are doing it younger and younger and younger when i was that age i had braces like i was playing outside like i was a tomboy i was choreographing dances you know it's i just don't understand why these girls are like this now actually i do understand it's because of instagram yeah i'll agree with you there it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] up every girl wanted to be kylie jenner yeah she started a whole new trend and in reality the idea that her mother let her do that to her face and her body when she was 17 years old it should have been a crime yeah like she looks a lot better now though i don't know what she was going to look like she was a kid true think about what you looked like at 17 years old she didn't get to grow up i mean i had baby fat i do like pictures of me at 17 i'm like i was like an entirely different person i feel like i started my face started to mature when i was 23. have you done botox ever in my face ever wow anywhere in my body i shouldn't say my face i've never gotten an injection of anything in my face yeah like it's flawed you're flawless thank you very much flawless thank you i think kylie's really bad though we pulled up some bad ones that went bad but i'm black yeah look at how young she was look i mean you don't even think about she's got bangs like since she's a kid you know what i mean like yeah yeah yeah no i think she was 15 in that picture natural beauty over there so she probably had time to develop yeah even a haircut would have changed her you know what i mean i understand what she did because this was what was happening all the time because her sister was in the spotlight and people kept comparing her not realizing she's a t she's a kid i mean 15 years old look at what she's wearing she wouldn't even wear this look at pictures of what i wore when i was 15 i'm like ew what was this disgusting look or the way i was doing my makeup but you know it's just you're a kid you have time to develop you grow up when you hit your 20s you start i still feel like i didn't really figure out i feel like until i was 26 really it's kind of where i was like oh okay actually that outfit looks really bad like you know we were all wearing like weird american apparel harvey leger thinking we looked cute it's just she was a kid this is kind of like hollywood now right this is hollywood though they want you to like hollywood right no i hate it they want you look like you're 25 when you're 15 and people feed into it so she was just tremendously insecure because she had cameras around her house as she was going through her awkward phase and girls go through a really bad awkward phase guys have it a little better and so she changed her whole face and her whole body i don't know what she would have looked like i really don't one of my favorite feuds that you had was with um harry styles does that still talk about actually no i feel like harry and harry styles i would actually be friends i think he's cheeky i have to tell you because you did you throw shade at him which i could do he has no drip i'll give you that but girls love that guy no i think he's very talented but and personally for me i could not like a man in a dress is just not attractive to me don't care there's no way to make it trendy to me at all men should be men meant to dress like men it's just not my thing but we're kind of getting into a society where like things are getting weird i think they're just trying to be talked about when they do that that's and that was my point i mean that's what i think 100 is why they're doing it why are you on like honestly girls love it so when he posts in a photo of a dress and all the girls love it they don't they love that they do not know they love him because he's talented he's talented and he sings and it's he's got the rock star thing going on sure so harry styles being an exception women do not like men that wear dresses even if they were dating harry styles they wouldn't want him wearing a dress yeah they'd be like why are you wearing a ball gown today where are we going we're going to starbucks i'm going to put on a ball gown no woman likes that do not believe women like that what people like online is to pretend that they're awoke and like oh my god this is amazing gender is a construct oh my god this is amazing like i worship oh my god like that's online culture it's not real life there is no woman who wants her man wearing a ball gown there isn't she doesn't exist", "VzFvo94pj4I": "i just have to say that i object strenuously to your use of the word object strenuously i strenuously object sounds like it hurts you're of course not responsible for the words of somebody writing that document but i do think that laughing at it is the reason i instantly seem to point out the fact that this was a hearing on the rise of white supremacy and i am the only black person that was invited to speak on this this is incredible democrats just don't it's like they're like black people are suffering so we're going to call in a bunch of white experts talk about how black people are suffering and then all three of them proceed to lecture me on my own suffering but telling me that they're like you know i have a phd in white supremacy and i know that you are suffering and you're not understanding well i've got you know i'm a doctor in white supremacy and you are not understanding the diagnosis that you are suffering as a black person i mean it's like the person that never stops going to college that person like they really think that you can just learn something in college and that's it so like they've learned what it means to be black and they just need to help this poor black person sit next to them understand what she's living through as opposed to maybe asking me okay and mr clay so we have two members who have not so i'm gonna go to the two members who have not yet i'd also like to point out again talking about their tricks in congress this is the end of the hearing so every single congressman got to speak and this is how they run their game so jamie raskin who was chairing this committee was like great goody all the republicans have gone and now it's just me and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna end i'm gonna end this hearing by allowing all of these white people to turn and yell at candace and then i'm gonna say hearing concluded so this is once again setting me up to essentially not be able to respond which is just so vicious it infuriates me so there were no republicans in the room before a literal hail mary happened um in the form of mark meadows to respond for a second i'll yield thank you uh i believe miss owens when you use the word hilarious it was in it was referencing the fact that no one had asked you a question it wasn't to the subject matter of the hearing is that right that is correct and for to have another witness insinuate something that is not accurate is just not appropriate mr chairman for how witnesses are supposed to behave in front of this committee i also think you didn't say it doesn't matter about the subject matter of today's hearing you said there are other subjects that matter as well and maybe we should so mark meadows had walked in and he was like shocked at what he was seeing and he was like take all my time and i have said that i said that in my opening and i will say it again you know that white supremacy and white nationalism is nowhere near ranks nowhere near the top of the issues that are facing black america and the reason that you are bringing them up in this room is because it is attempt to make the election all about race as the democrats not in my case i'm sorry please do not characterize my motive mr chairman it's my time it's my time you've got your time mr meadows i'll give you three more seconds every four years you bring up race and you knew exactly what i meant when i said hilarious and you just tried to do live what the media does all the time to republicans to our president and to conservatives which you tried to manipulate what i said to fit your narrative okay i was not referring to the subject matter that is hilarious i said it's hilarious that we are sitting in this room today and i've got two doctors and a misses and nobody can give us real numbers that we can respond to so we can assess how big of a threat this is because you know that it is not as big of a threat as you are trying to make it out to be so you can manipulate yeah i crushed that i was so mad i was so mad i was just like it's just the idea of lecturing someone how to be black it's just i don't understand like how could you just be so removed from reality that you think having a phd in white supremacy allows you to lecture someone on what they're going through it's just it's totally bonkers but it happened and uh that was the last time dr kathy baloo probably lectured a black person on being black in america ever again such a meaningless degree by the way how do you get a degree in white supremacy doesn't make sense like you know just none of it makes any sense she's got a phd in white supremacy what does it even mean done the exact same thing every four years ahead of an election cycle and it needs to stop actually the best part about this entire clip is the face that jim jordan makes afterwards when he realizes that it was a hail mary and after i finished speaking he just like does this like warm fuzzy christmas smile that's so good he's just like haha jamie raskin it was a good day it was a bad moment like i wanted to actually strangle someone but it was a good day because i think it really exposed them for you know what they are", "ZNy3-e9wk7s": "what's up Instagram Kanye said it's Awards a war we've noticed a war obviously a cultural War we are battling for the soul of this nation you know the drill you're probably wondering why I'm so excited to tell you to delete your PayPal account um I don't know I just I'm in a good mood today I've been I'm exhausted which is why I look like trash but it's all chill I've been to Paris and Back in case you missed that and I don't know I just feel it in my gut and in my soul that we're gonna win this so anyways woke up um to some news that PayPal which you're seeing in my stories PayPal has gone full communism you know we know they're all jumping in that direction and they've decided to update their policies to reflect the fact that if you are a perpetuator of misinformation uh also known as since it's just they're gonna censor you right also known as if you're a conservative also known as if you say anything against the state decided narrative if you speak against the government the over governance also known as if you don't think maths work also known as if you decide you don't want to get a vaccine also known as anything the state wants right that they will actually find you 2500 like they actually wrote this in their updated policies that they would have a right to finally they could also shut down your accounts and aside from misinformation if you shared anything that could be considered harassment against uh a uh gender identity so if you say I don't know something crazy like only women can give birth PayPal could be like oh 200 taken from you and some people were like oh I don't even keep twenty five hundred dollars my PayPal account um read your policy agreement again you've linked your bank account so I would I'm pretty sure that means that they could just take the money out of your bank account directly that's solution that you have agreed to when you give PayPal access to your bank account um so that's insane and it's crazy and it is one of these things that I feel is a God moment because I have been experienced this a lot like for whatever reason I feel like God is using me as an instrument God is using you as an instrument like we there is something going on like the energy just feels different it and the time feels like now if we have this narrow window to save our country and every time I like get this inkling to do something like I have to fight within my capacity which is every day because I have kids dude my daughter is 12 weeks old my son is about to turn two in January and this is going to be their future so every time I feel like I need to fight in my own capacity something happens something like this and it is a message that I'm supposed to use my platform to share what I've been up to to the world so I basically wanted to tell you guys a story and ask me as any questions many questions as you want in the comments I want to be as transparent as possible and how I got involved um so basically at the end of last year uh I turned to my husband it was when General Michael Flynn got that letter you remember and it basically said I don't know if it was to him or to his wife and it basically was from JPMorgan Chase bank and they were like we don't want you at our bank anymore because of who you are wow mind-boggling scary right think about the fact that if you're a criminal or You're a murderer you could literally leave prison and you could open an account at Chase tomorrow but if you're a conservative God forbid gasp and there was it wasn't just Michael Flynn this happened I think first person it happened to like all the banks were kicking her out was Laura Loomer um they've been coming inward right they're like oh they're radical okay but these people are not murderers and Killers so how do you decide they're not allowed to bank or partake in the economy right and so this happened and I went to my husband and I said to him like obviously I feel that we need to leave this bank I have been a Chase Bank customer since I was 18 years old so it was a big decision for me and they had been a basically good bank but I'm not getting that letter and I'm not shutting up so um you know goodbye so we pulled out our money at Chase and opened accounts locally here in Tennessee but the banks that we are with like didn't have all of the same services swear God is always looking out I'm in Dallas doing an event and a billionaire and you can look him up his name is Toby nugabauer basically ambushes me and he asked me to like come to his house for meeting ambushes me he's got a team of people in his house and they're all working like from laptops in Nova's living room and they're basically like we've built a financial services company like we built it we have built what everyone's looking for and it's credit cards debit cards it's eventually going to offer like insurance and all these things down the line and they're leaning into conservative principles he is a strong conservative the initial investors which I will not name but obviously will come out they're all strong conservatives um you know billionaires and I put their money in realizing that this is where we're headed and they basically ran the number and realized that conservatives are the ones that pay their bills and yet you have all these companies that are telling us that we can't be a part of their economy and so I became an investor a co-founder I said I believe in this glorify glorify.com glorify spell g-l-o-r-i-f-i so glorify with an eye 100 I want to be a part of this I want to be the face of this whatever you guys need I know this is what's happening so I joined and I've been a part of the beta testing for the last couple of months this is actually my card making sure the number is not showing they actually make it out of bullet brass which amazing they when they launch their products like insurance companies they're going to give discounts to responsible gun owners like they are leaning into conservative principles this is real this is not imagine this is not a fluke this is not built it is my the app is better than Chase app um I moved my money into that account we've been like I said we've been in beta so we weren't planning I wasn't planning on making a video about this for another month but then PayPal came out and did this and I just went you know what today is the day to tell you guys about glorify you can download it in the App Store you can open a checking account in 15 seconds a credit card you can apply for a credit card in seconds it's faster than any other um any other accounts that you may have any apps that you're using go ahead explore you're not even you can open it without moving your money so you should just do it because I'm telling you to do it and and then you can decide for yourself and your family what your future looks like let me tell you something right now the future looks like all of these Chase Wells Fargo's basically telling us that we better abide by puberty blockers being given to children or shut up and I'm not shutting up and I'm not abiding by puberty blockers given to children so um what I am doing is constantly using my platform to shine a light on the people the organizations people like Kanye West who are willing to stand up to the Mob of Hollywood uh people like you know glorify getting involved with them and like I said I invested like I am like I'm one thousand percent in I'm one thousand percent and I moved my money I made sure it worked I'm traveling with it I'm using the card like this is not this is not a joke um and I'm doing that because I know that the conservative economy is just beginning ladies and gentlemen the conservative conservative economy is just beginning they have messed up Paypal knows they're already trying to backtrack and say oh it must have been we don't know how we sent this out without it being proofread no you said what you meant you hate us we as conservatives need to stop giving our money to people that hate us and that's been hard in the past because there was no other alternative now there is okay so I believe in this so much that I want you to screen record this I'm gonna drop it my Instagram if I am wrong about glorify come come come for my head come for me and say Candace you lied to me I have tested this through and through uh there's there is no fluke here um there's just it is what it is guys God is with us God is good I'm telling you I just feel it in my bones that all will be exposed black lives matter if you're attending the funeral that's on Wednesday you know wear black watch documentary all of this evil is coming to a head and goodness is there to meet it so again guys glorify.com actually use the app the app is way better I'm trying to think there's anything else I should like warn you about or anything that I haven't told you just ask me in the comments all right love you guys be good be happy we are going to win the spiritual battle bye", "YZpUxO0OXhA": "of all the people that republicans could have selected they picked candace owens i don't know miss owens i'm not going to characterize her i'm going to let her own work he said before he characterized me play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about adolf hitler i agree i actually don't have any problems at all with the word nationalism i think that it gets the definition gets poisoned um my granddad behind me what i don't want so when you think about whenever we say nationalism the first thing people think about in at least in america is hitler you know he was a national socialist but if hitler just wanted to make germany great and have things run well okay fine problem is that he wanted he had dreams outside of germany he wanted to globalize he wanted everybody to be german everybody to be speaking german miss owens said quote if hitler just wanted to make germany great and have things run well okay fine the problem is that he wanted he had dreams outside of germany so when people try to legitimize adolf hitler does that feed into white nationalist ideology i think it's pretty apparent that uh mr lube believes that black people are stupid and will not uh pursue the full clip in its entirety he purposely presented an extract an extracted it is not proper to refer disparagingly or with to a member of the committee uh the witness will not do that again see he wasn't expecting to be able to respond if it wasn't for guy ruthlessberger saying his last name wrong i always butcher it but he i would have never been able to respond to him and that's how they play in congress they game the system you didn't listen to what i said may i continue please as i said he is assuming that black people will not go pursue the full two-hour clip and he such a coward extracted he cut off and you didn't hear the question that was asked of me he's trying to present as if i was launching a defense of hitler in germany when in fact the question that was asked of me was returning to whether or not i believed that hitler was a whether or not i believed in nationalism and that nationalism was bad and what i responded to was that i do not believe that we should be characterizing hitler yeah what a jerk i mean that was incredible but i remember i was just boiling as i was like i'm not gonna be able to respond to this because he knew exactly what he was doing he knew that he could use all of his time so whenever he wanted he wasn't expecting me to be able to respond and unfortunately for me guy walks in and he a lot allows me to respond and ted lou wasn't expecting that but i just remember i i was so angry my hands were shaking i had my granddad behind me my husband behind me and i was texting my husband after he went and i was just like i'm not going to respond to respond it took everything in me not to like stand up and shout but fortunately i was rescued and i was able to respond and we created this viral moment which i was not expecting that was my first time testifying in front of congress i didn't know what to expect but i did not expect for the democrats to be i guess just so machiavellian and trying to strategize to paint someone as something that they're not and then not even giving them the decency to respond to it in the end he got what he deserved a viral moment showing him to be the jerk that he is i mean it just it's a bizarre thing to be characterized as a a hitler supporter i'm black i mean it doesn't make sense it's just so ridiculous but you know ted lou is a slime ball and so he was going to try to get away with what he got away with and so it went viral everywhere i mean it was literally by the time i left there it was going so viral i was shocked i've never i had never seen a c-span clip go viral it was genuinely everywhere", "ByjXeilefJs": "black-on-black crime no I'm not talking about the extraordinaire sophistic switch points the fact that police violence should be the least of our community's worries I'm talking about the new epic Marvel movie panther if you are black you have to see this movie it's an all-black cast and a black director this is for us calm down I didn't see the movie because I'm black I saw the movie because I'm a Marvel fan similarly I saw Wonder Woman because I liked DC Comics not because I'm a woman is that allowed anymore am I in trouble don't care let's recap what I loved this movie for those of you that haven't seen it this movie is about the thriving hidden african community of Wakanda locanda hides itself from the rest of the world including from the suffering black communities in America they don't allow the struggling outside people into their society because and I quote refugees bring their problems with them of course the villain of the movie sees this mentality as a problem he feels that what Condon's have betrayed their own race he feels that these advancing blacks should join him on his path of vengeance he encourages them to burn down their own neighborhoods literally to set fire to their own plans because he wants to rage war against the people who colonized the Africans now have I heard this backwards thinking vengeful nonsensical burn down your own neighborhood I hate everyone mentality before excuse me so what condo was a thriving black nation because they were tough on borders realize you shouldn't give asylum to refugees but rather should help them try to fix their problems on their own land and the wakandan people were focused on the opportunities of their future rather than obsessing over the details of their pasts or these Africans alt-right as the Washington Post on an expose declaring them all racist yet I mean I'm assuming that everybody celebrating this movie is a major supporter of Donald Trump and his policies right look I'm gonna give out any major spoilers from this movie but I will say this it's theme is timely I speak out every single day I'm what I perceive to be a very real split taking place in the black community those with the victim mentality versus those with a victor mentality those who view themselves as down with the cause and those of us who realize that the cause is bringing us down there are virtually no white people in this movie which was wonderful because for the first time ever the black community had to try to solve its own issues without pointing the finger without looking for some imaginary handouts lack conflict black solution this must be why they say art imitates life thank you guys so much for watching [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "vlJ0Z1Fu-eQ": "all I know was what I grew up around where Haitians african-american so my parents they both came over here from Haiti my dad is strong believer in working hard his work ethic paved the way for him he had his own business he didn't want anybody to control him he wanted to work and provide for his family which he did really good family but you know we can't really discuss politics like that Iowa's told both Democrats and I didn't know why I didn't question it everyone around me was doing it I didn't have a brain at that time to think for myself I just pretty much followed the crowd I wasn't in form or even educated on what the beliefs were between you know the parties so I worked in this Democratic campaign where I was volunteering it was a lot of manipulation going on they know most of the people that they were reaching out to were educated anyway they would go into the low-income communities they barely speak any English and it was just using them to get them to vote and when I started seeing what was going on behind the scenes they were saying one thing but it was something totally opposite from what they were saying to the people and there were it was a lot of manipulation going on so I was like this is not what the people need I literally told them you guys are the devil and I walked away and then I called my dad the same night and I was like dad I don't want to be a Democrat anymore and he loudly said oh my baby has a brain now so he was always conservative I just never knew because he was very you know quite about it [Music] it grieves me that they're still oppressed they're in slave not knowing that there's freedom on the other side I want them to know if you want it if you want a better life for yourself for your children and whoever you can do it you can

when we hear this with michelle williams when she accepts the statue and says i would have never won this award if i had not gotten my abortion i was reading a book um ronnie starks how the west was won how the west won um and in it he sort of depicts this temple that was being raised native americans far from the pocahontas depictions they were actually you know they were cannibals and asked aztec warriors is what he was talking about raising this temple and they sacrificed children and adults every time they would build these temples and he talked about this one temple that they raised where they sacrificed 26 000 lives unimaginable today right and we're looking at this going oh my gosh how barbaric how archaic this could never happen today look at american society we're sacrificing 890 000 babies per year why for convenience for narcissism because i'm not ready because i think i could go further in my career if i don't have this child that's really sick", "H3kb3wZHpIE": "look at the experiment of black america today right a group of individuals who in the 1960s when patrick moynihan issued his report they were shocked they said there's there's an epidemic going on because 23 percent single motherhood rate in the black community 23 percent of black children are growing up without a father in the home an epidemic today that number is more like 77 right from the 1960s to today think about that the family breakdown and then i think okay but it's not just like we're seeing it in the category of welfare incentivization or that it's just focused on black america they've widened it right suddenly now we have black lives matter you can go explicitly to their website and they state explicitly that they want to dismantle the nuclear family think about that billions and billions of dollars going to an organization that is not even hiding what they're after and by the way to this day nobody can answer this question when you log on to black lives matter and you donate a dollar where does the money go it's a huge mystery it's like a hole right oh we i think we know where it goes we don't no no but we know right where it goes billions of dollars they raise using black faces right look over here brianna taylor look over here george foy quick quick quick quick get your dollars out the only way to stop this is to donate and nobody knows where it goes there's no black lives matter college campus there's no black lives matter office building there's no i mean is it possible what is the employee structure what is the corporate structure you've raised billions where is the money going it's a mystery we know what their goals are the breakdown of family and this isn't the only system let's not just put the whole honest on black lives matter and then i said well another thing that seems to be after the breakdown of family is the radicalized feminist movement right i'm probably one of the proudest non-feminists in america [Music] you have women running around telling other women that they don't need men that that is a token of your security in life that you don't need men the good news is that biology will take those people out right i mean that's it's not going to end well right we don't have to fight that too hard okay that they'll finish themselves off eventually with that mentality but what an idea to tell little girls that there's something fundamentally wrong with being a woman in general we've seen this attack on femininity right it's like the uglier you can get the more points you earn in the world of feminism shave your head dye it purple right wear baggy clothes don't shower this is like progressivism unleashed right the grimier you can look then you're sticking it to the man the patriarchy but at the same time feminism also says that the height of feminism is taking your clothes off right right cardi b and [\u00a0__\u00a0] right that's the number one song you can laugh it's the number one song there are girls on the internet doing this dance popping on the ground wearing less clothes this is the direction that culture is going because you know what we also celebrate promiscuity now is what radical feminism is about sex should mean nothing it's okay if you want to have sex it means this is it this is liberation let me tell you something if you think that the only way to make it in life you have to take your clothes off you are not free you are in bondage okay that is not freedom and by the way if you needed me to to say it by the way if you think you're winning because you want to free the nipple one of the many radical feminist campaigns take your clothes off and be naked and you think men are gonna be upset about that the patriarchy might be winning okay they might be winning you have girls that are pretending that this is progressive right you shouldn't aspire to marriage but you should aspire to sexual promiscuity the radical feminism what are they after at the end of the day the breakdown of family right they want you to think that you're going to be happy at the end of the day if you stay away and you don't value these things if you don't value yourself and have respect and want to look for a man that respects and values you let me tell you something there has never been a country in the history of the world that has survived without strong men right value masculinity right and that push that radical feminist movement is also seeping in to men and suddenly testosterone and masculinity is wrong right gillette commercial don't let the three-year-olds wrestle right it's just toxic masculinity whatever that means right made-up phrases the left is very good at making up phrases right they sound very important and they mean nothing right men being men showing any signs of of manhood is suddenly wrong and i look and i do these college campuses and something's happening there's there is something weird happening i see these skinny little boys come up they're not standing up straight you know i have a question how could you possibly say candace owens that you don't see the horror of ben shapiro you know and i'm thinking how old are you and he'll say to me i'm 20 you know and i'm thinking wow a couple of uh generations ago let me tell you this is you are not the 20 year old that could have ended world war ii okay something is happening [Music] and that should scare everybody that's just everybody to think that just a few decades ago the average age of those boys that landed on the beaches of normandy an absolute horror show if you can make it without crying through through watching and i shouldn't say netflix's you should have canceled it by now but maybe some of you saw they did the world war ii in color they put together a documentary and they went through all the video on the clips and they colorized it and it did something different when you could see the faces of these boys and i'm not just talking about the american boys right they did this documentary so well that you cried for the japanese boys you cried for the the young german boys you realized how young they were right you cried for the american boys you cried for the british boys because you realized my goodness right this war was fought by men that were 18 to 20 years old on average think about that right and there was a survivor of omaha beach and he's talking and he starts crying and he starts talking about how in on the boat over in omaha it was just bad luck luck of the bad luck of the draw the worst beast you could have landed on would have been omaha and the americans got that beach and he's talking about how in the water on the way there it was so choppy going across the channel that they were all just vomiting on the way there and some of them were crying saying i'm never going to see my mother again it was the same you know when they were talking about the japanese boys who were told that they had to kill themselves and they were just crying because they were they were basically ordered to commit suicide and they were terrified and i'm sitting here and i'm crying watching this thing and realizing and the the armored ships dropped too soon which allowed so many of them to just be killed and they still ran and they were using one another's dead bodies to shield themselves and the average age was 22 years old on that beach and i just think my goodness my goodness right we had these people that you would think should be boys should be home with their parents and they were going to save western civilization right and then you fast forward to today and you have kids boys the same age literally crying outside of my events because i'm being handed a microphone like that is the peak of their suffering right there right like oh my god candace owens is coming to speak and it's incredible it's incredible right and this is what happens when there is this attack on masculinity they don't these boys wouldn't know what to do with the screwdriver if you handed it to them and gave them three days to figure it out right i mean and it's pathetic and it's sad it's sad because they're being encouraged that you shouldn't want to do these sorts of things like if you know you shouldn't want to be able to put things together you need to talk about your feelings you need to talk about this you need to talk about that and i'm looking at this culture and i say that right there the attack on manhood telling women to be men telling men to act like women and what is it about the breakdown of family and the breakdown of society",

that i cannot stand there's it's an attack on family and these things that work it works men are biologically unable to have children so the aspiration to climb a ladder forever to wake up every single day and and not have to worry about being pregnant for nine months i mean that makes sense we're different creatures you know i think that's like a troll though no it's like all you're good for

matter I was obviously able to discern that they were using the faces of dead black people to get you guys to run around act like fools get your sons and daughters arrested in protests wearing signs painting streets BLM BLM not realizing this is free marketing this is how marketing Works in business everybody ran around to be a billboard for black lives matter they got white people you owe me an apology too white liberals running around with their guilds opening their wallets bending down to Black lives matter and nobody asked the question about where all the money was going if you guys did not recognize that it was a corporate scam how do you think they got the NBA on board so quickly the NFL on board so quickly how do you think they managed to transform America so quickly with politicians demanding that there was black lives matter squares and black lives matter signs I mean you were looking at a business that was being built very quickly around a suspicious time election time when the riots seem to keep happening black lives matter they were telling you covet didn't matter protesting was more important anybody with common sense knew that this was a money laundering operation anybody with common sense knew that black lives matter was raising money for something other than black people you're looking around there was no headquarters there was no intent to say they were going to build a school that they were going to give out scholarships to black people there was nothing that was done other than demanding Your Allegiance and some of you guys a lot of you guys got on board and got angry a can of summons and other people too who were telling you that this was a scam you called me so many racist names and said that I betrayed my race when in reality you were

90 million dollars okay they were funded they were bust all of this stuff was paid for by white Democratic operatives right where's the rest of the money they're getting you focused to look at the three black people but those people are at the bottom of the organization okay these people were just dogs that were willing to betray their race or willing to let black people get arrested or willing to allow you know black Americans to Riot in the streets for these young kids to get records they didn't care right those were just your average day Hustlers these three women right these three black women were just your your regular day of scam artists right like that's just the stuff that you see how do you guys ever gonna scam artists but they're at the bottom who's at the top that's the question you should be asking yourself it's not going to be a black person it's going to be white people right because it's only white people it could only be a white person that is sitting at the top when you looked at who was pouring cash initially into black lives matter right I kept telling you it was using Black Faces as a front and they were raising a bunch of money it's gonna be a white person right they said they raised over 90 million dollars so far we've accounted about 10 11 maybe 12 million dollars that has been scanned from you guys start maybe it's time to look into all the Charities that said that they were backing black lives matter when they were lying saying that they were 501c3 they were never a charity black lives matter Global Network was never a charity but you

whatever it is that she wants but then she wants you to wrap it up bring it to her at a shower she sits in a pretty little chair and she opens the gifts one by one and pretends to be surprised for each gift that she picked herself and then we have to go oh and then she goes oh it's this it's the spoons that i wanted everyone goes oh yay oh thank you then she opens another one look it's a box

interests and our there's nothing wrong with that by the way the idea that women should want to climb the top of a ladder and you know go into corporate america and be there forever women want to have

wanted to send black america back they're going to put you all back in change how did i come out of high school believing that and the truth is is that i was taught that what really opened my eyes to the idea of a modernized updated plantation was actually frederick douglass's autobiography the first couple of pages the first chapter he talks about what it was like being a slave and he says something that sent a chill down my spine he said that he felt nothing when his mother died because of the system of slavery was constantly moving people around one of the things that held that system together was the breakdown of family remove that familial connection that thing that you're supposed to be so center and important in our lives the breakdown of family was central uh to slavery everything that you learn in school is a lie lyndon baines johnson is taught to be a hero because he inked the civil rights bill in 1964 people go oh he saved black america this democrat president saved black america and they leave out all of the portions of the fact that he was an avowed racist he used the n-word all the time but i've got to prove that it discriminates and i can't prove in texas it won't vote now white folks so we're learning a partial history another thing that seems to be after the breakdown of family is the radicalized feminist movement if you look at the cause of male deaths speeding and violence and you know you add them all up the women's movement and the dissolution of gender roles means that you would have about five more years of life to live you have women running around telling other women that they don't need men that that is a token of your security in life will you forever be self-partnered even if you do have an actual partner 100 what an idea to tell little girls that there's something fundamentally wrong with being a woman you have girls that are pretending that this is progressive you shouldn't aspire to marriage but you should aspire to sexual promiscuity and that push that radical feminist movement is also seeping in to men and suddenly testosterone and masculinity is wrong men being men showing any signs of of manhood is suddenly wrong and it's sad it's sad because they're being encouraged that you shouldn't want to be able to put things together you need to talk about your feelings and i'm looking at this culture and i say the attack on manhood telling women to be men telling men to act like women what is it about the breakdown of family and the breakdown of society the last thing which was so important they control hollywood cnn msnbc this is why they control culture this is why taylor swift says it's her mission to get conservatives out of office this is why cardi b is sitting down with bernie sanders

of course not responsible for the words of somebody writing that document but i do think that laughing at it is a real problem because these are real families that are impacted by this violence and i think our efforts towards talking about this have to start from a place of mutual respect which is what i've heard from from this side of the table now the reason we don't have those numbers i want those numbers as much as you do but the number to say the numbers don't show something is simply not supported by the data okay and i have 38 seconds left ms mulligan if you can if you want to respond within that time the only thing i would add is that um it's in the name terrorism domestic terrorism it terrorizes us it terrorizes us in our homes it terrorizes us in our schools um and the and to the points made by the other panelists it is disproportionate um to its impact on any individual life and it's not you reject the idea of something that doesn't matter or it doesn't really matter absolutely reject okay all right so here's where we are every every member now has had five minutes and okay and mr clay so we have two members who have not so i'm gonna go to the two members who have not yet and then and we'll give an opportunity for a closing thought to any member who wants before we go my next to responders mr medellin i thought mr meadows okay mr meadows and x and mr clay then to you mr jordan uh miss owens obviously this is a gang up on you you know we we're we're giving uh these witnesses the ability to do a rebuttal on you and so um you know i i find it unfair miss blue i mean you know candidly for you to show mutual respect and then you to go after miss owens it's not appropriate so miss owens you can have four minutes and 34 seconds to respond for a second i'll yield thank you uh i believe miss owens when you used the word hilarious it was in it was referencing the fact that no one had asked you a question it wasn't to the subject matter of the hearing is that right that is correct and for have to have another witness insinuate something that is not accurate is just not appropriate mr chairman for how witnesses are supposed to behave in front of this committee i also think you didn't say it doesn't matter about the subject matter of today's hearing you said there are other subjects that matter as well and maybe we should spend some time on those is that accurate that is correct and they matter much much much much more and i have said that i said that in my opening and i will say it again you know that white supremacy and white nationalism is nowhere near ranks nowhere near the top of the issues that are facing black america and the reason that you are bringing them up in this room is because it is attempt to make the election all about race as the democrats not in my case i'm sorry please do not characterize my motive mr chairman it's my time it's my time you've got your time mr meadows i'll give you three more seconds every four years you bring up race and you knew exactly what i meant when i said hilarious and you just tried to do live what the media does all the time to republicans to our president and to conservatives but you tried to manipulate what i said to fit your narrative okay i was not referring to the subject matter that is hilarious i said it's hilarious that we are sitting in this room today and i've got two doctors and a misses and nobody can give us real numbers that we can respond to so we can assess how big of a threat this is because you know that it is not as big of a threat as you are trying to make it out to be so you can manipulate and the audacity of you to bring up the christ church shooting manifesto and make it seem as if i laughed at people that were slaughtered by a homicidal media maniac is in my opinion absolutely despicable and i think that we should be above that to try to assign reality or any meaning to a homicide homicidal maniac writing a manifesto which by the way let the record show also stated spyro the dragon the child's cartoon as a source of inspiration he also cited nelson mandela as a source of information i don't think i don't think that nelson mandela has inspired mosque shootings you can correct me if you think i'm wrong you would rather assign meaning to a homicidal maniac than to actually address that i said to the things that i said today that are actually harming black america number one father absence number two the education system and the literacy rate illegal immigration ranks high abortion ranks high white supremacy and white nationalism if i had to make a list again of 100 things would not be on it this hearing in my opinion is a farce and it is ironic that you're sitting here and you're having three caucasian people testify and tell you what their expertise are do i know what my expertise are black in america i've been black in america my whole life all 30 years and i can tell you that you guys have done the exact same thing

de-incentivize no we don't well isn't there a way to demilitarize our kids i'm not saying defund them but do do we need for the police to be like storm troopers running around the country kicking down doors because somebody might be smoking a joint there's got to be a way to reign the police in a little bit no let's be clear the police are not kicking down your door because you're smoking a joint okay so that is like that's like that's like left is a fantasy land like i'm just smoking good joy and the police always just kick down the door and because they're just like military right now like come on that's ridiculous like maybe you're a drug dealer and you happen to be smoking a joint and the police came at that moment but let's let's be real about that secondly i have this crazy i'm trying i'm trying i've just spoken to joy man i just came in here guns are waving um but what i will say i'm a big believer in teaching your kids to respect police officers so somebody can point to me to um the case this year where the person who we saw being you know aggressively pursued by the police was listening to the police officers um instructions then i would say okay maybe we do have an issue with police officers every single case that is brought to the public forefront the thing that never gets discussed is why couldn't this person listen to police orders and i mean we're not talking about like the police snapped on the i'm talking the police officer is saying 18 20 30 times giving them an instruction and they don't do it and they keep coming towards the police officer a police officer's life needs to be protected too um and these people are crazy what we saw in philadelphia with that guy walter wallace wielding a knife i mean and and still black lives matter protested and rioted and looted and because he was shot and killed as he should have been shot and killed because he tried to kill police officers um the problem is that we have arrived suddenly into a society where people do not believe that they have to respect adults period and this is what happens when you have an entire generation of people who have grown up without fathers in the home you know the idea of listening to any type of authority feels to them to be like an assault why should i have to listen to a police officer why should i have listened to my teacher why should i listen to my guidance counselor we have an authority issue in this country in terms of having basic respect and and it's not a hard request when a police officer pulls you over i've been pulled over i listened to his instructions that's the first thing right now you have parents teaching people you don't have to listen to police officers instructions if you are black but when we look it's going to lead to more black death when we look at a lot of these videos we see incidences where police seem to be using excessive force right now the most extreme example is george floyd who lost his life but then there's other examples where we look at the videos and we go wait a minute what in god's name is happening why are the cops doing this why are they sitting on a guy why are they cutting off his airway like can't shouldn't cops be trained to basically get someone in cuffs and then put them in a police car and not use a lot of these techniques that they're using whether it's a chokehold or something where you can do serious damage to somebody wouldn't that be good to kind of do more training i mean more training is not a bad idea right for the police saying when is it when is a cop done a choke hold on somebody without asking them to first abide by basic instructions let's use george floyd as an example because they refused to release the full tape in its entirety until it leaked to daily mail you know some eight months after the riots had stopped right he was asked to get in the vehicle he was already in cops and was asked to get the vehicle he resisted getting in the vehicle as he was standing he was already cuffed said he was claustrophobic and didn't want to get in the vehicle and asked to be put on the ground right this is after he had they had gotten him from a car so we knew he wasn't claustrophobic when he was in the car trying to get rid of his fentanyl right then they try to put him in the police cruiser and he starts saying i can't get in there i'm claustrophobic saying i can't breathe as he's standing up right so once again we have a situation where we're so keen to say what police officers could have done differently what can human beings you know people that are not police officers do follow basic instructions well we got to imagine that the their interests are not to put you in a chokehold right but the job the job of a cop is you're dealing with people when they're not at their best right now i have people that i know that are cops that tell me our job is we're if we're at a situation you're already dealing with somebody that's not at their best they might be drunk they might be on drugs they're they're basically this is not the best moment of their day and i just think that it can't be like hey abide by me or the immediate next step is chokehold there does have to be some value in de-escalation training or we cannot stand on someone's head i'm sure you agree with the george floyd you know that like what they did to george floyd was was murder it was crazy i mean i agree with that and i've said it over and over again that situation even though i do feel it's important to point out that george floyd by his you know um according to his death record he did not die from a choke hold he died from a fentanyl overdose i'm sure the chokehold didn't help i'm i'm sure it didn't help but he he he was not restrained in a way that stopped his breathing media misrepresentation that should be clarified right um but regardless if i don't think a police officer should be on anybody's neck for nine for nine minutes right um and so i will agree with you on that assessment but i what i also am disagreeing with you on um is the idea that this is the standard across police officers you know what i mean i mean millions and millions of arrests every single year and we're talking about 20 of them um that go wrong all right and nine black men where the situation went wrong this year down from what obama was in office so we're hyper focusing on an issue um nine arrests that went wrong in all of in all of 2019 despite 2020 despite all of these arrests um and why are we doing that human beings are not perfectable so you're never going to be able to beat that amazing number of nine going wrong right but and this is the reason why we know the names of every single black person that has ended in an unfortunate circumstance with police officers because it doesn't happen often so we're able to know every single one of their names and um you know again i believe in personal responsibility and accountability i think police officers are treated horribly more often than the other way around and and the data and statistics back up my point police officers are killed by black men 18 and a half times more than black men are killed by police officers so you're now you're you're you're putting the honest on police officers to be even nicer even though they're 18 and a half times more likely to end up dead than the other than the other way around um no it doesn't it's a dangerous job it's a dangerous job and it's one of those jobs where i think like a nurse like i joke around about nurses now that are yelling and screaming on facebook about how tough their jobs i get it it's a tough job but when you were a nurse you also signed up for the idea that sick people were going to come into hospitals this is part of what you signed up for so i just feel like with cops like they signed up for a job that was potentially deadly it was very dangerous and they are not the ones complaining and protesting right all right yeah she's you know but but listen sometimes they complain when you do when you ask them uh to you know potentially you know you know like take a look at their behavior or their culpability i've heard cops just like rejected out of hand but i've heard other really smart people go that our police go listen there should be more de-escalation training right there should be more training cops should be able to use other tools other than a physical hold immediately or a chokehold or something like that there should be more psychological training about immediately i hate when people say that because they don't do that immediately that is not an instinct of a cop it has not been the instinct in any of the police videos we've seen even this year do assess it always escalates that situation after a long period of peace", "uFcQeRgeH5s": "the black conservative movement is very no it's not covered by the media at all and you're the biggest voice in it but there's tons of people out there coleman hughes whatever a lot of different people and the media ignores this like it's not happening and some of the most interesting conversations that are happening online are are black conservatives that are talking about uh american policy and and and disagreeing and and and it's very very interesting trump made gains with minority voters you know what do you think explains that because we've had the most strenuous year for race relations probably in in in that i can remember and donald trump is a very volatile figure gains with minority voters what would you attribute that to people like me independent voices uh people are not buying it anymore and and goes back to what we talked about earlier the fatigue of victimhood i mean if if you weren't tired of being just black this year when everything oh you're struggling you know you're just being black i mean at a certain point i kept saying black america is going to wake up to this game you can't just keep doing this every four years and popping around and then black lives matter black lives matter disappearing like a magic act and then jumping back in you know for the next election cycle eventually black people are going to get smart um and and that's what's happening you know we're having conversations we have our own platforms this is the reason why the left is ignoring us but at the same time pushing for social media censorship because it's problematic when people like canis owens can gain you know millions and millions of followers and you know they are no longer relying on the mainstream narrative about race right they have another option and that option sounds a lot better than waking up every day and being miserable just because of the color of your skin and seeing yourself as a victim like it's it just feels better i have a better product right you get to go out and be happy and live your life and you can do anything you want because this is the greatest country in the world versus you are a victim permanently a victim your life is going to suck forever because you were born with brown skin but i think it's i i think it would be fair to say that black people face a different set of challenges than white people they they you know in many in many cases right and that specifically well i think that if you look at where i grew up i grew up in long island and long island a lot of my friends were able to inherit homes because their parents got loans after world war ii or their grandparents got loans after world war ii to buy these houses and they created the suburbs i think a lot of black people were excluded not only from those loans but also from like those communities like realtors that show black people houses would be threatened and it was like so the suburbs and the house which seemed like the the engine of wealth for a lot of middle-class families right building equity in something ownership if black people were excluded from that so i feel like there is a little bit of catch-up being played certainly if there's not because it doesn't explain or account for the reason that black americans during my grandfather's time did better than black americans during my father's time so that defeats your entire argument right well what do you mean so what happened from you know the 1950s through to the 1970s that black americans became more impoverished you know owned less homes and became more reliant upon the government structure and the truth is is we married the government welfare and now whether you want to argue whether or not that was strategic and whether it's the fault of the government and lyndon baines johnson uh you know for opposing the great society act which is what married black women to the government that's an argument you can have but you can't say it's because there's this long-standing black american just couldn't break away if you look at the 100 years following slavery black americans did well the fact that black americans performed better economically under jim crow laws than they are doing today you just cannot point to a systemic racism it has to do with choices the choices that we made to marry the government and the fact that we cannot out think this government structure that you know black americans still believe in the victimhood and will take the handouts that black americans will take to the streets and demand you know aoc right now is saying we need to make sure you know black and brown people the government pays them to stay home well hello welfare policies that you know were the first in that couple black america in the first place that they're being reintroduced right now under cloven 19. so i always see right now we have a choice right now if we're going to give another 100 years to black poverty by all the saying yes to more government handouts we don't need government handouts that's the biggest issue is more and more and more from the government the government is not our parent it's not our mother it's not our father it was an attack on the black family um but if we don't wake up to that we're never going to get ahead black people make the worst decisions out of every um out of every group in america and and you can compare us to who who is the most successful group in america it's not white americans so your argument about you know white americans is it asian it's asia i forget who it is is it yeah so nobody wants to talk about asians because it you know it defeats all the arguments well why people had it easier because no one's going to say asian people during world war ii were japanese people were internment camps right well that should be the title by americans today the title of your next book should be nobody wants to talk about asians can't buy candace house yeah i do understand but as as a white person i always say to myself i was a druggie i drove around i did not get pulled over nearly as much as my black friends i feel like they 100 are more likely to get pulled over and more likely to go to jail and we're doing a lot of the same things right i was uh you know irresponsible reckless human being and i just feel like i maybe had i definitely had certain advantages that put me in a better position versus a kid you know just the idea that i had money for a lawyer so if like if there's a black kid who got caught smoking uh blunt and went to jail um and he went to jail and my parents could maybe get me a lawyer to get me out of it that to me is it's easier being white than if that's the right but here's what's wrong you just brought up a good point and then you racialized it okay rich people yes yes economic privilege is a real thing it didn't happen because you're white right so it didn't matter if you think that puff daddy's son is not going to be better off being pulled off if he has pot right than some poor white kid you're wrong but you've accepted the argument because of the color of your skin not because of your economic circumstances right because of your economic circumstances oprah winfrey doesn't have any offstring but i'll guarantee you that if they ever got into trouble they'd be able to get out malia and sasha obama who we know like to smoke pot good you know good for them they're you know they're enjoying their uh teenage years right they are not going to go through the same things that a poor white trash kid is going through stop racializing people have more privilege do you think we have common sense do you think we should legalize weeds so that we don't have this crazy drug war that's putting people in jail no i mean listen i i i i have to think through those arguments more because i do think that first and foremost i i think conservatives that pretend like pot is the worst thing in the entire world are just completely crazy and out of control um but the issue is the slippery slope argument and we know that's real because right now in california what are they doing trying to um with a heroin and methamphetamine they're trying to make it so you just get a ticket and keep going so the problem with the left is that you never just stop at one thing you're not like okay you legalize pot and they're gonna be done right they're like already in california pushing for decriminalizing methamphetamine and heroin and and this is now an argument that we have to fight so it's hard to find what the right answer is when you know that it's it's never enough to do one thing meaning a couple years ago it was all about just gay marriage just gay marriage i mean the second the supreme court passed gay marriage we were on trans rights and we it's been shoved down our throat uh and now we're at kids picking their gender and bathroom signs need to all to be all inclusive and men name tampons in their restroom so i mean i i don't know where i stand on it completely because i i understand but isn't there a little bit of a you know listen slippery slope argument certainly makes a lot of sense but isn't there so much pain happening because of non-violent drug offenders being in jail for so long it's disproportionately affected people that are as you said economically disenfranchised lots of them happen to be black and hispanic i just feel like there's so much pain there's so many real world consequences to that particular law that we should especially when it is legal yeah it is legal in certain parts of the country and people are becoming millionaires yeah okay so criminalizing is different than saying making it legal um and and i agree with you i think we spend a lot of time uh you know the idea of anyone being in prison for smoking pot is just ridiculous where are you where are you are you strictly pro-life no abortion no matter what see i don't know we don't know where candace owens feels about every single issue we don't are you like 100 never can have an abortion or is there any gray area with you the problem is that there's no gray area with the left right so i'm pro-life i'm unapologetically pro-life because i understand now as someone who used to be pro-choice um just how brainwashed you are as a young girl in school about abortion i mean until i was 25 i thought it was just a clump of cells which is crazy i mean that's just so that's they're fundamentally teaching you um that that abortion is birth control um and that you it is the responsible thing for you to you know kill your child and when you look when i actually understood the history of abortion and studied margaret sanger and understood that it was actually a eugenicist movement um where people were trying to get rid of black people having any offspring and we look at the numbers and you realize that it is black americans that are giving disproportionately uh the black population would be double today if it wasn't for abortion that's a scary thing to even say and that these clinics are being put strategically in black and hispanic neighborhoods um you know i haven't i have an issue with what abortion was designed to do and the fact that it's been largely successful um you know by margaret sanger but you know through and through is as an american success story you know she wanted to make sure people um that were black and brown as well as immigrants from eastern europe were not able to have any offspring so i have an issue because i'm educated about it", "vwazTtFAvX0": "is a very important year it's actually a very important time in america i know that's why so many of you guys are in this room um and it's it's it's really it's so important and and this mission of blexit is so close to my heart because there's something that's gone very very wrong in this country particularly in the black community can we agree on that um when we made the the video that you just watched i wanted images to be put together of the black community that i grew up with what i mean when i say that um is that you know i was a 90s child growing up in the 90s i always call that the golden decade right liberals weren't crazy yet um people seem to be getting along and i i remember such positive tv i talk about that all the time such positive tv for black america so when i was growing up i was watching the hutstables the jeffersons at nick at night right staying up late the cosby's they were just just wonderful images on tv of what it meant to be not just a black american but an american to have goals to have your family be together you know they'd have their issues throughout the episode and then every episode would end with the moral of togetherness and then i don't know what happened but then sometime over the next couple of decades that kind of tv left and it was replaced with something else it was replaced with violence for black america i believe the most popular tv show that's on right now is love in hip-hop right the breakdown of people trying to aspire to make it um as rappers people that come from strippers you know being strippers and trying to make it um in the music industry and i wanted to ask myself a question of how did that happen who who is trying to realign our goals as citizens who's trying to make us think that as minority americans we should be aspiring to be ballers and rappers and not lawyers and doctors like they were when we watch tv right um so the blexit mission became very close to my heart and i said um i don't i don't think america will ever be fixed if we don't wake up minority america if we don't get hispanic americans and black americans to wake up to what's going on and the only way we're going to do that is through education the pushback that i got instantly was that people feel that today it is harder believe it or not it is harder to be a black american today than it was 60 years ago i find that to be completely insulting to the people that lived 60 years ago as black americans the idea today that's being sold to us throughout the media is that we are being held back because of slavery i find that to be completely ridiculous i've said this a thousand times i've never been a slave and i'm never i'm not going to start being one to appease to liberal orthodoxy but then i started studying and i said okay well what was slavery right what were what were the tenets of slavery and this is important so i want you to pay attention because i believe a left has has played a trick and they've done a very good very good job at doing it i was reading frederick douglass's autobiography in the first couple of pages you know he talks about his life as a slave and he talks about how um when his when his mother died and when his sisters died he didn't feel anything he felt nothing it was there was no attachment because part of being a slave meant that you were constantly being traded right you you weren't with your family forever that was the idea and that was that was twofold one is because they wanted the best slaves and that was just a business model and the other part was that they actually didn't want um black americans to have a sense of family to have a sense of togetherness you know they wanted to keep them working like machines so the breakdown of family was necessary um a second attribute of slavery which we all know very well was illiteracy um they it was illegal for slaves to learn how to read it was so illegal in fact but if you were a white american and you were taught teaching slaves to read you could be prosecuted that's how serious it was the reason for that is is obvious um an educated mind can't be enslaved right if if slaves were reading they may have picked up on the abolitionist movement that was happening in the north right they may have found out that there were people that were actively working to free them so they had to make sure that they that they were not allowed to read what's interesting about that is we've we're all of these years past slavery and we're in the exact same predicament the black family is still broken down right but slavery doesn't exist in in the 1960s a single motherhood rate was 23 percent today it's 74 percent 74 percent of black americans are growing up without a two-parent home without a father in the home and larry elder will talk to you more about that because he really is an expert [Applause] [Music] illiteracy all you'd say well we've been put into schools what is what is our public school system teaching us these days when 70 of black boys in california can't pass a basic literacy exam when in inner cities like baltimore they looked across five public schools and couldn't find a single child that was proficient in reading or writing right this is happening right in front of our faces and nobody's talking about it there isn't a single politician on stage that's talking about illiteracy rates right well that's because in an uneducated mind if you don't know your facts it's very easy to enslave you they'll use images they'll use culture right they'll tell you they'll make you feel like something is going on when it's not hence black lives matter right this idea that we're all under attack from police officers now we're under attack by by really a really shoddy public school system is what we're under attack by you know um and then you think about how how is it possible that we got here and no one's talking about it how is it possible that i start talking about and everybody starts freaking out like it was this big secret that this was all going on and nobody was ever supposed to know and that's simply marketing marketing 101 i think if you have to take your hat off and say something that the left and the liberals have done brilliantly um it's marketing it is they they are they have a way of marketing things to us and they sound amazing even if they're horrible like pro-life that sounds amazing i i mean saying that you're pro-choice right pro-choice sounds amazing i want you to have choices i want choices they're just leaving out the fact that that means that they're murdering babies right that 17 uh that that uh 17 million black babies have been aborted since 1973. i think that number's at 19 million as i say on the stage today and that the black population has stagnated it's there's no more black population growth in america it's completely flatlined right nobody's talking about that they're talking about ushering illegals over the border because illegal uh will be the new black soon they're not going to need they're not going to need black people anymore because they have a new market of victims that they can go after and get addicted to government dependency why is no one talking about that right there's there are so many ways that the left has has taught us to oppress ourselves my belief is that minorities that are oppressed in this country are oppressed by ourselves by our mindset by our belief that we've bought into that we're victims and that we can't get ahead and here's the truth if you believe that you can't you won't it's that simple", "KrwmLH8QD7I": "today we are counting down 3 times the left to mean absolute and utter mockery of black people

like she doesn't even care yeah I just want to sit in on a DNC strategy session okay here's how we get the Latino vote and bananas I'll say that I love bananas i bailando to enrique inglesias okay here's how we're gonna get the Irish vote potatoes so insulting and easy to see why number two on our countdown is when Hillary Clinton pretends to be a jay-z without further ado I would like to introduce to you how stupid the left thinks we are oh my god it's jay-z and Beyonce I always do whatever they say I can guarantee you that Hillary Clinton cannot even name - jay-z albums and yet just a few days before the election and while Donald Trump was out on the ground speaking to real people she opted to throw a jay-z and Beyonce concert in case you don't speak liberal allow me to interpret that action for you hi black people I know your communities are suffering but you are too stupid for me to waste my time speaking to you about that so instead I'm gonna throw you with jay-z and Beyonce concert you guys like hip-hop right so insulting it actually pisses me off she doesn't even think she needs to speak to us about what is happening in our community and how she is going to fix it if you guys watch that concert and thought oh my god Queen Bey and Jay or hashtag with her then congratulations because you are considered an easy targets by the left back when I used to babysit the three-year-old that I watched was obsessed with Barbies whatever I want her to do something I would tell her that Barbie thought it was cool Barbie thinks cleaning your room is cool that is

die a happy death this means progress because his skin is black like mine I'm not gonna lie I was fooled first to back in no 8 when a bomb ifirst came around just think somebody that looked like me made me buy into the illusion that perhaps this country was headed in the right direction and then I woke up and I will never repeat never ever be fooled by the color of someone's skin again just because you are a woman does not mean that your primary concerns are for women just because you are a black man does not mean that your primary concerns are for black men lessons learned the hard way anybody I want to be very clear on the takeaway here the left thinks black people are stupid they rely on our interests hip-hop culture music hot sauce apparently to distract us from the truth which is that we are in fact ignorant we are ignorant because we do not know our own history we are ignorant because the left controls the academia the media and Hollywood q JM day and they have purposefully thrown off our sense that we would never discover the source of our own pain and misery slavery segregation welfare you name it it has and always will be orchestrated by the left thank

but i was like that's my husband no questions asked it was like a poll that i can't even explain it was almost scientific in terms of questions that you should ask on a first date definitely figure out what they're looking for i think that a lot of times men will be quite honest about that and even if they're not honest to your face they won't text you after that and just you know it'll let you know that they're just kind of looking to play around um so you should ask questions that give you the answers you're looking for if you're somebody that wants a serious relationship you should ask that individual are you looking for a serious relationship are you looking to commit or you're just kind of looking to date around as i said before if it's guys that are just looking to date around

head and i was able to identify three really important verticals that the left has been tremendously successful at hijacking the first vertical is family they broke down black families if you ever want to make an entire community go amok break down their families they remove the black fathers from the home and then the black youth started getting into a lot of trouble and and what who does the black youth turn to if they don't have mom and dad together to tell them what's right and what's wrong they turn to culture they turn to hip-hop they turn to media they turn to music they turn to jay-z they turn to kanye west they turn to beyonce to tell them who they should like lebron james tell them who they should vote for they in many ways become mom and dad so i understood that culture

the first question i would ask them is how many pregnancies um are derived from rape instances and get the answer from them it's obviously going to be very low and then you say do you believe that that justifies the slaughter of this many million babies that's taking place every year do you think that that justifies the slaughter of 19 million other babies the majorities of these circumstances

an entire concept around when men interrupt women but you literally just interrupt me and you don't identify as yourself as a toxic feminist the fact that you're a woman is completely irrelevant to me but maybe it's irrelevant to men as well when they're into when they interrupt people", "uoFdI1jvOBE": "this is Danielle take one when I think about blex it and in one part it is an exit it's an exit from status quo it's an exit from you know what was traditional to us in the sense of you know indoctrination not really kind of exploring and I think of it now as like a homecoming it's not what we're walking away from is what we're walking towards and we're walking towards the values that are important for our community it's walking towards voting those values in that will build our community and really strengthening ourselves and those things that matter to us you [Music]", "NBYcGVE1A4U": "every single person in this room remembers whatever it was that was their fear climate campaign when they were in school i was a generation global warming we were showed a video of melting polar bears al gore's video inconvenient truth was shown to us and they said in 10 years the whole world's going to be underwater before global warming scare there was the global cooling scare if you ask your parents or grandparents this is this was a real thing they told people that it was actually the climate was cooling so much and eventually the whole world was going to freeze over so you had children that were terrified every winter thinking like this could be it the world's going to freeze over and then you had a generation and some of you guys might have been in it that had the acid rain scare personally i think that one's the most traumatizing you're okay if you're a kid in arizona it doesn't rain much but the poor kids in seattle must have been traumatized growing up", "TQ5yKAka_g0": "men are biologically physically stronger than women as a rule maybe there's some you know some scrawny guys obviously that some stronger girls can be but they're always exceptions but as a rule um and we should be living Our Lives according to rules and not exceptions and then the left these radical leftists are demanding that we now live our lives according to exceptions rather than rules so it's in this case it's exceptional when somebody goes through gender dysphoria they're now trying to make that a rule and say we all now we gotta change the bathroom signs to accommodate this less than one percent issue that we have now we've got to allow these people into sports and

should stick your nose up to culture and say that's not the way that we go that's the way that the left goes well this is why the left has been winning they've had a stranglehold on culture they have a stranglehold on hollywood and hip hop and music and all of the idols it's why don lemon pretends to care about lebron james opening up a school because all he cares about is that five second sound bite when lebron james says something against the president the the cnn the left they understand this um that that's how much it matters because those kids when they're growing up in the projects and they're growing up in the hood and they don't have a father that's at home they look up to these idols they put on a jay-z track they wonder if they can be like lebron james culture is an incredibly important aspect and it's something that andrew breitbart understood it's why he said he was the person that said the quote that politics is downstream from culture and it's incredibly important that we as conservatives embrace that", "YeV_wChdgw0": "[Music] hey guys all right you asked and as always i deliver today i'm going to be making what i call at home a summer pasta usually when we think about pastas we think about heavy we think about red sauces you think about very very creamy sauces and this one i feel like if you're still craving carbs if you're pregnant like me you're always craving carbs but it's summertime you don't want to feel that heavy this is a great substitute now my producers are fancy they decided to name this lemon pesto bucatini with brussels sprouts and manchego so we're going to be making that and later on we're going to also throw in a little springtime strawberry balsamic green salad i make this all the time for george today i'm going to be making it with bacon bits i've already made the bacon and i've cut it up and it's in this bowl but my husband's super catholic so he does not eat meat on fridays and so you can sub that out don't look you have to do bacon you can leave the bacon out all together and make it a vegetarian meal all right so first thing we're going to do is make sure that your pasta water is boiling and i also put a ton of salt in my pasta water second thing so you have that leftover fat from the bacon do not throw it out that is really great because you're going to use that to make the brussels sprouts so i'm going to throw in a few of these most of them not all of them right into where the bacon was formerly cooking at the same time you can throw in some garlic and a little bit of red pepper flakes there's no such thing as too much garlic i've tried the challenge doesn't exist put as much garlic as you want but go easy on those pepper flakes and while that's cooking this would be a very good time to throw in your bucatini and in terms of how long i cook the brussels sprouts it's kind of up to you at your preference i personally hate a soggy brussels sprouts so i like them super crunchy and the good thing about brussels sprouts you cannot burn them i swear the more burnt they are the more delicious they get so great i told george i was i'm gonna go um on set to cook what i make you at home but just know when i get home i'm gonna be too tired from cooking on set it's cooking for it now it's a brand and so i can't cook for you anymore this is how i like my noodle a little bit al dente now before you actually pull the noodle from the stove and strain it you want to use some of the starchy water now that seems like totally crazy but you're going to use some of the starchy water drop it right into the brussels sprouts which you are then subsequently going to move from heat once that's done it's time to strain now we're going to grab those noodles which are nice and al dente tongs are what you want to use and just kind of start mixing that around now i like to add a little bit of manchengo cheese you can use whatever cheese you want now i do the cheese first because the noodle is still hot and you're going to want that to kind of cook down go back to your tongs give it a nice little flip a little bit of pesto here and this is basil pesto by the way i know there's all different types do not forget to add lemon mmm this is why i call it a summer pasta something about the taste of lemon makes me go oh it's summertime ladies and gents do not forget your bacon unless your husband's catholic and it's friday and what we have here is just some basil you can add right to the top there [Music] now i'm actually not that great at plating so this is about as pretty as it's gonna look if you're in the uh owens household [Music] okay [Music] it's just i absolutely nailed that that's all i can say i literally know that it's delicious do exactly what i did and your husband your son your brother your cousin they're going to love you all right guys everything has magically been cleaned up because if you're like me you have elves in your kitchen now to go with the summer pasta you got to make a summer salad even though nobody really wants to see the salad it's good to look like you're a health nut and to make one and put it on the table so what we're going to make today is a nice strawberry salad but always always always in my salad i always put pine nuts in i don't know why i mean my husband were obsessed with pine nuts it's very easy to make obviously pine nuts produce their own oil now you want to watch them because they do go from like a nice crispy brown to like a burnt popcorn kind of experience very quickly so you just want to kind of keep moving them until they get a nice kind of a golden brown on them toasted pine nuts honestly smells so good yeah these are good okay so you see that how quickly they can start to you want to pull them right now that's what this is the color that you want all right pretty simple here pretty straightforward you've got your pine nuts in there now you're going to add some strawberries as many as you like today i'm going to use it's but for me it's either going to be the balsamic dressing or lemon i use a little bit of squeeze of a lemon and olive oil i'm not oh the taste test moment we're going to add some mantego again whatever cheese you want all right pretty straightforward now we're going to taste it let's go it's just delicious obviously so easy to make you're going to love that so that wraps it that means we have our summer pasta now you have a summer salad now you can make this at home and if you do make it you have to tag me because i've gone through this extraordinary effort i even put an apron for you guys the least you can do is tag me use my handles like subscribe that was so much fun you guys i'll see you next time [Music] you", "yQ30tmn_IcU": "well and i want to talk about the education system because in my opinion i think it's the most important discussion that we should be having right now is what's happening to the american education system it's completely collapsed and if you look at what they're trying to do in terms of radically transforming the education system so first they started this initiative you know when i was young it was you have to go to college you have to go to college the pressure from the guidance counselors go to college you're going to be a failure right well when you think about that those are really the early seeds for taking over the minds of children making them think that the only way that you're going to be successful is to go to college because as we're learning today these people are going to school and they're learning to become activists that used to be reserved on a college campus we're seeing these people come out of college they're angry they're activists they're coloring their hair purple they're woke to the world they can tell you about feminism racism sexism give me ism and they can tell you about it but they can't do basic things like change a light bulb right so what we're doing right now is the education system especially with this new initiative called critical race theory which is an abomination we'll get into that in a second it's an absolute abomination you're teaching children how to hate one another it's the exact opposite of what martin luther king's dream was right teaching people how to hate each other to say to a child on the basis of their skin color you are oppressed is racism to say to a child the basis of their skin color you are privileged is racism you do not get to look at somebody's skin color and assign a bunch of attributes to them that's a literal definition of racism but why are they starting this initiative in my opinion the star english initiative because first and foremost they seek to divide people but also because what they're simultaneously doing is they're replacing hard academics meaning kids today they can tell you all about the problems in the world but they they can't solve their math homework right so they're not learning the hard academics like math engineering we're producing right now in america and i learned this through a thomas so book this is the dumbest kids that have ever existed and that have ever existed in america they know nothing they're failing their sats and yet interestingly there have never been more degrees handed out so they're not passing the tests but they're all getting degrees the question is is why why are we handing out meaningless degrees in feminist dance theory in latinx studies latin x studies which is like if you even use the word latinx i can tell you real quick you're not a latino right the whole language would have to be redone if you started replacing it with an x everything is a girl or a woman they're teaching transgendered studies you know pick your gender what do you think is the evil and the goal in doing this when you're when these kids actually know nothing but you're convincing them with these meaningless degrees that they know everything yeah i think it's a diversion of the mind man you know you got them thinking about this this is important your gender how you feel and you know all these other things are important but that's not that's not reality you know i wish that they would teach people you know to be married and to raise a family and to be have integrity and you know i i talk to a lot of people this victim stuff that they create in people's hearts is i talk to people that disagree with me and many of them come from a perspective of being a victim i can never be this this is the problem this is where the problem is at and the way i was raised and the way i look at it now is that focused on solutions you know work harder than everybody else that that has nothing to do with the color of your skin you know be a good person to other people and it goes back to god to me like when i when i got saved i started realizing that color don't mean nothing we're all god's children and we should treat each other that way and and at these universities they want to divert your attention and make you think that white people hate black people in it black people are oppressed and that that that is so far few in between that we shouldn't even be wasting our time arguing over that stuff is america racist america is not racist are there people in america that are racist yes their people hate people since jesus them days and and it goes both ways when i was growing up you could never bring a white girl home are you cr raise your hand if that's how you grew up just be honest and i'm not i'm not trying to put nobody on blast but it's like you can't bring a white girl huh what's wrong with you bro you're a sellout if you made straight a's you straight a's you put your pants on your ways you go to school you articulate yourself you sound really smart you're trying to be white as if that's a bad thing and those things i believe in culture needs to change i think and i know you agree with me ken is that like i feel like black people in this country i'm speaking to black people because i grew up around black people i don't know what it's like to be white i didn't know what it's like to be black so i remember black people used to be way bolder smarter you know they they demand prayer when they come into a room it's like man that brother is sharp man that brother is a leader they they walked around with their with their chest out and their head high i did i mean think about martin luther king in the protest they had suits on they getting sweaty with suicide martin luther king coming out of jail just with his uh his neck you know his uh one button loose with a town they they were respectable they were strong bold you see men leading and now now i just see emotionalism i see the product of a failed marriage with single mom and i'm not i'm not bashing single moms but everybody out here know that that's not the way god designed it now if you got the cards play the cards that were dealt to you but but god wanted strong men to be in the family leading these young men to be courageous and teaching them what to do how to present yourself how to go to a job interview how to have courage and we we just have lost that and now it's this feminization of men now they're wearing dresses now they get into their feelings you know you are a man you are not allowed to have a feeling don't bruh cry in the car don't y'all remember y'all remember what's that friday he gonna cry in the car y'all he cried in the car he wasn't out in the public crying and being soft i'm just gonna be honest man what happened to what happened to men and it's funny that you're that you're talking about that because uh what what all of these things have in common and especially when you look at the left is that it's an attack on family right so when whenever you look up at the left and you go they seem to be running in so many different directions like you know why are we talking about bathroom signs and we have nothing more important to do than talk about bathroom signs but like yes like no no no all bathroom signs need to be changed you're like okay well what does that have to do with all you know racist race races you talk focus on race race race race we need to talk about the transgender you know agenda kids picking their gender there's not 27 you know genders feminism i hate men the patriarchy why are all these women so angry the me too movement well what does all of this have in common and the truth is that it's an attack on the family right if you are a child today in certain school districts they are allowing you know teaching children they can pick their gender and all this stuff and they that they are believing and fighting for the right for children to have corrective surgery is what they're calling that's a nice name for mutilating your genitals right at a young age um that child will never be able to grow up and have a normal family ever again right that's just what it means when you talk about women and this poison which happened you know for me i was forced to take in college a feminism 101 class which they called women's studies 101. um you know we were taught it didn't matter what happened it was a textbook that we had it had every problem since the dawn of humanity that women have ever faced and the teacher would say you know this problem why did this happen and the answer was always because of men she wanted to train us to believe that everything that ever happened to us was because of men well what is she doing with that she's making it so that we're wearing rose-colored glasses and no matter what we think men are horrible human beings right and that's an attack on the family because you can't have a functional relationship if you look up and every time you see a man you see a problem right at the same time you have policies i call it you know baby mama culture that are saying to women that you you can do it by yourself you can do it all by yourself being a single mom and listen you are you can right but you shouldn't have to that's very difficult for a child to get ahead when they only have one parent it's very difficult so you routinely see this attack on the family and what's behind that in my opinion is government because in order for a government to grow that government needs to make sure you believe that every problem that you have they have an answer for not your mom and dad at home they want to become both your mother and your father [Applause]", "4lGGlbZRoV4": "[Music] facebook is trying to delete me big tech is trying to delete us our movement we must stop them you are smart long ago you stopped believing in the corrupt corporate media you cancelled the newspapers and cable shows and began reading your news from social platforms dominant on those platforms were conservative voices like mine we are the americans who did not have a voice in traditional media honestly do you think the left wants me to have a platform to speak but i can have a voice here on my own social platforms i can be heard that freedom infuriates the left who used to own complete control over our information so they hatched a plan to silence me and all of us conservatives and facebook is paying them for it here is how it works in 2016 hysterical liberals had to find someone to blame for their humiliating loss to donald trump in their minds they could not possibly have lost due to their own horrendous candidates or policies or their own failing message so they attacked the one thing that they did not have total control over social media companies they applied extreme pressure to silence or censor fake news which was just a fancy way of saying news that they don't like facebook bent to that pressure and created a fact checker network with god-like powers over all of us here is how facebook fact checking works a website you have never heard of run by partisan beta leftists stalk the pages of your favorite conservative personalities whenever we say anything they disagree with these fact checkers write a vicious partisan hit piece then they harass us and our audience by slapping hazardous warning labels on what we have posted many times those labels say missing context or disputed yes thanks facebook every political argument in america is disputed every argument is indeed missing some context but the insanity continues these hack checkers as i like to call them would be just an annoyance but facebook gives them the ability to destroy the reach of our content so we cannot communicate with you they demonetize our pages so we can't make a living producing content for our audiences and here is the breathtaking part most of these fact checks are pure partisan bile they're false fake untrue but there is no recourse for your favorite conservative creators we are held at gunpoint by these partisan hacks and facebook is giving them the gun this is why i am suing the facebook fact checkers i'm suing them on behalf of you your favorite creators and news sites on behalf of our freedom of speech and thought so who are these hack checkers well i'm suing a site called lead stories lead stories is run by a former cnn employee of 26 years who makes a living cannibalizing and slandering conservative content and creators his website has published disputed fake news stories including one that went after my content personally and so i'm going after him personally here is an important question who funds lead stories according to their own masthead lead stories is funded by facebook and google along with bite dance and what is bite dance it's a beijing-based company that owns the tick-tock spyware app our own justice department says the company is a national security threat and compromised by the communist party of china facebook then is paying for fact checkers funded by an arm of the communist party of china to censor my content here in america the communist party of china has more say over my content than the first amendment this is insanity it's un-american it's dangerous and it needs to stop this is why i am fighting our freedoms are at stake our movement is at stake we know these battles are taking place all over the world do you wish to support me in my efforts against these hack checkers well the easiest thing you can do right now is share this video if you wish to donate in support you can head to www.factcheckzuck.com we will fight and we will win", "MGdQh9BOWBk": "when i take a look at everything that is happening in america today it's a lot to process sometimes you turn on the news and you read a headline and you just think to yourself what like what are we even talking about anymore like when one more bathroom signs an issue right like suddenly you got people that are seriously marching in the streets over bathroom signs you've got policies in in los angeles which is the only communist country i've ever been to um policies in los angeles where they are fighting to make sure successfully that when you walk into a target or when you walk into any other store there's no longer men and female sections or boy and girl sections they want everything to be gender neutral and that seems like a really really ridiculous fight in terms of everything that's going on you really think to yourself oh you really think to yourself were there that many people in the country that were saddened by seeing men and women on signs that we had to make this um a political movement that we had to make put this at the forefront of everything that was going on despite all of the issues that we have going on so you see that battle and you go oh my gosh what does that even mean and then you look over here and that's one fire i mean look over here and then you've got the the climate change religion and you've got people uh children that are walking out of school right to protest climate change and you've got greta thundberg who is actually like 19 but looks like she's seven um who's taking a boat and saying oh i'm not gonna be in school anymore um you know until this issue gets fixed like climate is gonna be fixed because you're on a ship and you're embarking to america and you you're wondering to yourself they're they're saying the world's going to be over in 10 years and the kids are hysterical and they're rightfully hysterical because that's a scary thing to hear as a child and they're learning this actively and every single person in this room remembers whatever it was that was their fear climate campaign when they were in school i was um generation global warming we were showed a video of melting polar bears uh al gore's video inconvenient truth was shown to us and they said in 10 years the whole world's going to be underwater and the polar bears are going to be no more polar bears i had never even seen a polar bear but i was suddenly very frightened for polar bears when i was in high school very frightened until i got a little older and i learned from other generations that they had different fear campaigns of course the global warming thing didn't happen the polar bears actually um since that time when i was in high school the population of polar bears has increased so they said never mind never mind we're going to call it climate change now we're losing actually but before global warming scare there was the global cooling scare if you ask your parents or grandparents this is this was a real thing they told people that it was actually the climate was cooling so much and eventually the whole world was going to freeze over so you had children that were terrified every winter thinking like this could be it the world's going to freeze over and then it didn't because things started getting a little bit warmer and then you had a generation and some of you guys might have been in it that had the acid rain scare personally i think that one's the most traumatizing imagine every time it rains you think there's going to be acid falling from the sky this was actually a real thing these people were shown things in school and believed that the oceans were going to become so acidic that the rain was going to be acid so you know you're okay if you're a kid in arizona it doesn't rain much but the poor kids in seattle must have been traumatized growing up and then they kind of let go of that one and so now they've landed and they said okay we've been wrong enough times the ozone layer was another one um they've been wrong enough times that we're just going to go with climate change and we now have this this very dedicated group of people that seem like they're in a religion for climate change and i look around and i think i'm sure all of you think what is that about what is that fire alarm about we've got the the trans bathrooms we've got the climate change we've got the race issues we've we're hearing so many different things that are happening what do all of these crazy leftist pursuits as i like to call them what do they all have in common what is it do you think that they're just being crazy and trying to burn down the world no they're it's machiavellian it's much smarter than that there's a bigger plan going on when you look at all of these various issues that they're constantly stoking inside of this country and what is at the nucleus of this is something that black america i always say we were very much the lab mice for our government right we were the people that were tested tried and said okay this was successful the deterioration of the black family family is what is at the nucleus and i always think when i when i see a government policy or a government freak out that's taking place i say what does this have to do with family and then it all starts to lock into place right then you start to realize that the climate change lobby is currently telling children that it would be irresponsible for them to start families in fact they're giving out awards uh to people harry and megan recently received an award for agreeing to only have two children because the climate is a disaster and it would be irresponsible to have more children when the world's going to be over in 10 years right why start a family there's no point and then you you revisit those things like the trans agenda and the pick your gender and all of these bathroom signs and you realize that these children that are making such crucial decisions and mutilating their own bodies will not be able to produce productive families in the past you think about these race issues that have suddenly become so virulent and you think about the black lives matter movements which had absolutely nothing to do with black lives unless you include trying to end black lives as an initiative and i would say black lives matter has been tremendously successful how many black people died in the black lives matter riots how many black neighborhoods were burned to the ground in the black lives matter riots how many black people lost jobs because of their neighborhoods being burned down to the ground and the black lives matter riots which were sanctioned by the government and then you visit that website and you say well what is what is black lives matter about like what is everyone giving billions of dollars to and right there just said it right on their page you know that they're marxist they're openly marxist they believe in the abolition of the family right that this this this idea of a nuclear family unit a mom and a dad sitting at the table and talking to their children that that's backwards and it's wrong and it's racist right and that's always the magic word racist racist racist that is what that is the tool and the mechanism for which they attempt to garner power i mean they're calling things racist i have never even heard called racist before i actually read an article and the headline was that air was racist like oxygen was racist i didn't bother to read the article because it was pointedly ridiculous but as you're flipping through and you're seeing that they're calling more and more and more things racist and you're flipping through and you're realizing that they're calling various other things racist and wrong and backwards and trying to use these fear mechanisms understand that this is by design this has always been the design of any group of people any government that wants to seize full power over its people the family must be absolved the family must be ruined and why i say that this movement that we started with blexit and understanding that black america needed to be awakened understanding the history of what really took place in the 1960s and understanding exactly what it was that lyndon baines johnson accomplished with his great society act how genius it was machiavellian it was genius the very moment that black americans were given their freedoms with the civil rights act which he penned with a figurative gun to his head right he had to it was a mess there were riots happening okay i'm going to do this then he said but how are we going to keep them enslaved this is a man who for 20 years while he was in the senate voted against every single measure to give black americans any freedom then he magically becomes the president of the united states and he's got to deal with this and he says what are we going to do to prevent these people from actually being free even though i've had to sign this bill well then came the great society act so much so much of what we need to learn from today so much of what if you really want to understand what's happening with these coveted policies and and what they're looking for as they depress the middle class as they shut down the mom and pop shops right as they say oh no no these are not essential businesses but the corporations that we're in bed with these are essential we got to keep walmart and amazon open but we can't keep mom and dad's coffee shop open they've got to stay at home and save lives right well of course that's that's the government garnering more power and they garner more power when individuals need more from the government right when you have people that were going to work who didn't understand what was happening who were suddenly told to stay at home to save lives well what do you think happened after the great society act when the government began began knocking on doors incentivizing black women not to marry um the father of their children the government will give you more money we owe you for this horrible thing we did to you you know first there was slavery then there were jim crow laws and we the government now owe you for what we did to you so what we're going to do to you guys is we're going to give you free money that's what happened to black america in the 19 mid 1960s that's what happened with the great society act the government came to help and as ronald reagan said you know if the government ever says they're here to help you better slam your door right you better slam your door governments are never ever ever trying to help you", "QUVcI7HLC2M": "the second song amazing grace and i'm i'm gonna tell you why i love that song first and foremost um i walked down the aisle to amazing grace when i got married um and the song is always i never knew the history of the song it's just a song that when you hear it um it does something to you you feel it there's something about amazing grace that you feel and um so i thought to myself let me actually look up this song amazing grace where does it come from where does this hymn come from the story of amazing grace is it was uh it was written by a man named john newton he was a british man and he didn't grow up with any uh theological basis he had no religious convictions in his youth um he was sent to the royal navy he was forced to go there uh in that in that time and for after a few years he switched lifestyles and he joined um the african slave trade he used his ship and his vessel uh to transport slaves from africa um and in 1748 there was a storm at sea off the coast of ireland which he did not think he was going to survive and he reached out and he said god uh please have mercy on me have mercy on me and he survived six years later he gave up seafaring altogether and he decided to dedicate his life to christian theological studies and he was ordained in the church of england and uh he began writing hymns and he wrote amazing grace he actually wrote it as a a song that was supposed to go with the new year's day sermon and the song actually didn't pick up in britain it didn't pick up it never became popular until years later it did pick up in america it picked up an america in the south um when religion there was a revival of protestant religion in the south and it also picked up amongst the slaves suddenly the slaves began singing this hymn as they would work amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me and you can when you listen to slaves sing hymns when you listen to the heart and the soul that was behind them singing the hymns it's an incredible incredible experience to really process people that were in this horrendous position singing this hymn that was written by somebody who had a spiritual awakening about savior about grace and about god and i think the reason that the song means so much to me and i think to every single person why you instantly want to sing along is um because we're all the wretched right that saved a wretch like me that that is exactly how i feel the blessing that i feel every single day that i get to stand on stage and i get to have not just a second chance a third chance a fourth chance a fifth chance because i was a wretch right i made terrible decisions when i was young king face talked about the decisions he made when he was young brandon talked about him being arrested brendan tatum right all of us led these paths we're down these paths that were so meaningless and so harmful and so hateful and then we were saved i was saved simply by conservative principles right that is the chance that god gave me conservative principles go back to your root figure out who you are right and i realized that while i was living my life liberal while i was going around thinking that i was free because i was following no rules right liberalism and leftism there are no rules in life you should do and say and be whatever you want to be and not be respectful to other people don't acknowledge truths you can live in lies because being you can lie and lie and lie that's a form of freedom and i lived that way i lived that way for 20 some years until that thing that was supposed to feel like freedom started to feel like bondage i realized nothing in my life was real nothing that i had was tangible or real not my relationships not my friendships nothing was real because we were all building ourselves upon a lie a foundational lie when i lost my grandmother in 2013 that was the beginning of a turning point for me my grandmother was really the only mother that i knew and she raised all of us in the way that grandparents are able to raise it seems like everyone in the family cousins brothers sisters we all felt that we were raised by my grandmother and my grandfather and when my grandmother was taken into the hospital in 2013 they thought she'd be out in 48 hours but i got on a plane anyway and i went down to fayetteville north carolina to see her i had this big expensive bag i had just started working in private equity and as soon as i got a check even though i was some 100 thousand dollars in student loan debt i went and bought a fancy bag so i could fit in and look cool and my grandmother she must have known that she wasn't going to make it out of the hospital because she she took time to speak to me and each of my siblings and all of my cousins individually and the last word she said to me the first thing she said to me was candace you need to forgive your mother so random we weren't talking about my mother we weren't talking about my upbringing i had a tough one and then she said i worry about you i worry about you in new york city i worry about you because you're losing yourself and i laughed it off and i said grandma it's fine i got on a plane in 24 hours she was dead so it was an incredibly it was a moment for me because i suddenly started thinking about my grandmother and reflecting upon the upbringing and reflecting upon the ways that they had raised me the things that i had run from growing up in my grandfather's home there were nothing but rules we had to be sitting around the table reading the bible before we head to school he would ask us questions he would not serve us a plate in the morning he would ignore us if we didn't say good morning it was a sign of respect you don't come down here you don't sit down and ask for food until you greet the person that is serving you and you say good morning he ran a tight ship and that ship was filled with love a lot of rules but more love and it shaped me and my sisters when we were young he planted the seeds of conservatism that i would be able to harvest later my grandmother and my and my grandfather believed in the family structure my grandmother grew up in tortola british virgin island she had a lot of issues health-wise and she was because she was considered crippled because she walked a little funny she was treated horribly had a horrible upbringing a horrible life my grandfather grew up in a segregated south um and so he had to work from the time he was five years old laying out tobacco to dry in fayetteville north carolina uh picking cotton in fayetteville north carolina five years old wrap your head around that five years old getting up before the crack of dawn otherwise the carolina sun is too hot so you have to get up and you have to do man work right at 5 00 a.m in the morning crack of dawn and my grandfather did it he never complained and what was remarkable is uh never once in our household when he would share the stories of his upbringing never once so my grandmother would share the stories of their upbringing did they ever complain it was just what happened my grandfather despite surviving attacks from the ku klux klan never once in our household said a bad word about white people it never happened right my grandfather would just say it was a different time in fact regarding the ku klux klan uh he talks about that story with such tremendous pride um he says the kkk would come around and spray bullets in our home and my daddy would grab the shotgun and shoot back at them boys right boys calling these these terrorists boys right that strength um that victor mentality uh that my grandparents had never complaining it's so special it's so special it's the same victor mentality when you look just a few generations ago and you look at the boys whose average age was 22 years old that left their home country to go land on the beaches of normandy right look at the images of those boys in world war ii the courage watch the documentaries about the conversations that were had they knew they were going to die they were they they were they were 20 20 years old uh people that were 18 flying and doing all of these things pilots that knew they didn't have fuel that were flying towards mit towards midway and knew that if they made a decision to turn around they weren't going to make it back the courage the strength the way that these people fought and the way that these people lived the principles that they had the values that they had those are the things that made america great that made america unique [Applause]", "IH87iIWt2WM": "i remember when i first pitched the idea of blexit people thought that i was crazy that there was never going to be a possible way to wake up black america to bring black america and white america back together and i remember thinking it's so easy actually if you simply reverse engineer what the left has done right how did they do it how did a girl like me i'm quite bright come out of high school and actually believe that conservatives were racist and had the worst hearts and wanted to send black america back how did i come out of high school thinking that and believing that and the truth is is that i was taught that right if you get the answers right that is what you're learning in school you lbj lyndon baines johnson is taught to be a hero because he inked the civil rights bill in 1964. people go oh he saved black america this democrat president saved black america and they leave out all of the portions of the fact that he was an avowed racist he used the n-word all the time he was proud to be a racist and that he said in no uncertain terms that he would have those n words voting democrat for the next 200 years these are facts you can look them up right so we're learning a partial history you know i was criticized i'm always criticized but one of the million times that i was criticized by the left it was because they said that i was popularizing the idea of a plantation they didn't like that rhetoric they didn't like the idea of a liberal or a progressive plantation and they killed me and a guy wrote a whole article about it saying that this rhetoric is racist and that conservatives should not be calling it a plantation and it's wrong and he had me really confused because i wasn't saying it because i thought it was a cute phrase or i thought it would get someone's attention i said it because i meant it right i meant it after deeply researching and understanding how slavery worked in america how slavery how it was able to function what really opened my eyes to the idea of a modernized modernized updated plantation was actually frederick douglass's autobiography in the first couple of pages the first chapter he talks about what it was like being a slave and he says something that sent a chill down my spine he said that he felt nothing when his mother died he felt nothing when his sisters died because of the system of slavery was constantly moving people around one of the things that held that system together was the breakdown of family right remove that familial connection that thing that you're supposed to be so center and important in our lives the breakdown of family was central to slavery and i thought wow that's interesting because if you're talking about the breakdown of family and i'm sure larry elder dinesh has said this already tonight but look at the experiment of black america today right a group of individuals who in the 1960s when patrick moynihan issued his report they were shocked they said there's there's an epidemic going on because 23 single motherhood rate in the black community 23 percent of black children are growing up without a father in the home an epidemic today that number is more like 77 right from the 1960s to today think about that the family breakdown and then i think okay but it's not just like we're seeing it in the category of welfare incentivization or that it's just focused on black america they've widened it right suddenly now we have black lives matter you can go explicitly to their website and they state explicitly that they want to dismantle the nuclear family think about that billions and billions of dollars going to an organization that is not even hiding what they're after and by the way to this day nobody can answer this question when you log on to black lives matter and you donate a dollar where does the money go it's a huge mystery it's like a hole right oh we i think we know where it goes we don't no no but we know right where it goes billions of dollars they raise using black faces right look over here brianna taylor look over here george foy quick quick quick quick get your dollars out the only way to stop this is to donate and nobody knows where it goes there's no black lives matter college campus there's no black lives matter office building there's no i mean is it possible what is the employee structure what is the corporate structure you've raised billions where is the money going it's a mystery we know what their goals are the breakdown of family and this isn't the only system let's not just put the whole artist on black lives matter and then i said well another thing that seems to be after the breakdown of family is the radicalized feminist movement right i'm probably one of the proudest non-feminists in america you have women running around telling other women that they don't need men that that is a token of your security in life that you don't need men the good news is that biology will take those people out right i mean that's it's not going to end well right we don't have to fight that too hard okay they'll finish themselves off eventually with that mentality but what an idea to tell little girls that there's something fundamentally wrong with being a woman in general we've seen this attack on femininity right it's like the uglier you can get the more points you earn in the world of feminism shave your head dye it purple right wear baggy clothes don't shower this is like progressivism unleashed right the grimier you can look then you're sticking it to the man the patriarchy but at the same time feminism also says that the height of feminism is taking your clothes off right right cardi b and right that's the number one song you can laugh it's the number one song there are girls on the internet doing this dance popping on the ground wearing less clothes this is the direction that culture is going because you know what we also celebrate promiscuity now is what radical feminism is about sex should mean nothing it's okay if you want to have sex it means this is it this is liberation let me tell you something if you think that the only way to make it in life you have to take your clothes off you are not free you are in bondage okay [Applause] that is not freedom and by the way if you needed me to to say it by the way if you think you're winning because you want to free the nipple one of the many radical feminist campaigns take your clothes off and be naked and you think men are gonna be upset about that the patriarchy might be winning okay they might be winning you have girls that are pretending that this is progressive right you shouldn't aspire to marriage but you should aspire to sexual promiscuity the radical feminism what are they after at the end of the day the breakdown of family right they want you to think that you're going to be happy at the end of the day if you stay away and you don't value these things if you don't value yourself and have respect and want to look for a man that respects and values you let me tell you something there has never been a country in the history of the world that has survived without strong men right value masculinity right and that push that radical feminist movement is also seeping in to men and suddenly testosterone and masculinity is wrong right gillette commercial don't let the three-year-olds wrestle right it's just toxic masculinity whatever that means right made-up phrases the left is very good at making up phrases right they sound very important and they mean nothing right men being men showing any signs of of manhood is suddenly wrong and i look and i do these college campuses and something's happening there's there is something weird happening i see these skinny little boys come up they're not standing up straight you know i have a question how could you possibly say candace owens that you don't see the horror of ben shapiro you know and i'm thinking how old are you and he'll say to me i'm 20 you know and i'm thinking well a couple of uh generations ago let me tell you this is you are not the 20 year old that could have ended world war ii okay something is happening and that should scare everybody that's just everybody to think that just a few decades ago the average age of those boys that landed on the beaches of normandy an absolute horror show if you can make it without crying through through watching and i shouldn't say netflix's you should have canceled it by now but maybe some of you saw they did the world war ii in color they put together a documentary and they went through all the video on the clips and they colorized it and it did something different when you could see the faces of these boys and i'm not just talking about the american boys right they did this documentary so well that you cried for the japanese boys you cried for the young german boys you realized how young they were right you cried for the american boys you cried for the british boys because you realized my goodness right this war was fought by men that were 18 to 20 years old on average think about that right and there was a survivor of omaha beach and he's talking and he starts crying and he starts talking about how in on the boat over in omaha it was just bad luck luck of the bad luck of the draw the worst beast you could have landed on would have been omaha and the americans got that beach and he's talking about how in the water on the way there it was so choppy going across the channel that they were all just vomiting on the way there and some of them were crying saying i'm never going to see my mother again it was the same you know when they were talking about the japanese boys who were told that they had to kill themselves and they were just crying because they were they were basically ordered to commit suicide and they were terrified and i'm sitting here and i'm crying watching this thing and realizing and the the armored ships dropped too soon which allowed so many of them uh to just be killed and they still ran and they were using one another's dead bodies to shield themselves and the average age was 22 years old on that beach and i just think my goodness my goodness right we had these people that you would think should be boys should be home with their parents and they were going to save western civilization right and then you fast forward to today and you have kids boys the same age literally crying outside of my events because i'm being handed a microphone like that is the peak of their suffering right there right like oh my god candace owens is coming to speak and it's incredible it's incredible right and this is what happens when there is this attack on masculinity they don't these boys wouldn't know what to do with the screwdriver if you handed it to them and gave them three days to figure it out right i mean and it's pathetic and it's sad it's sad because they're being encouraged that you shouldn't want to do these sorts of things like if you know you shouldn't want to be able to put things together you need to talk about your feelings you need to talk about this you need to talk about that and i'm looking at this culture and i say that right there the attack on manhood telling women to be men telling men to act like women and what is it about the breakdown of family and the breakdown of society and then we have the lgbt push right and i'm sorry i know there's more letters i don't care to memorize them what l-b-g-t-q-r-s-p-u-v i don't know what's going on okay every day we wake up and they tack on another letter and they want us to learn a new word intersectional i mean i just i'm done with the leftist vocabulary but we get to the t because that's the most important part right to me right now today this push and i have been outspoken against this and you say why why is the thing like bathroom science are we willing to do that do we have a debate about bathroom signs and yes they're offended because this says women and this says men but i'm not women or man i'm intersex i'm this and that and then you hear that they're pushing this agenda in the school system telling children they can pick their genders trevor noah a few days ago came out and said gender revealed parties should be a thing of the past because your child will tell you what gender they are now about to be a parent not one yet but i can tell you that i did nanny and um the girl was three and she was convinced that she was a mermaid right the left would have it that i should be allowing her to stay in the bath forever because she is a mermaid there's this thing called you're the parent and they are the child right i mean imagine a society where we have to allow the thoughts and and add meaning to the thoughts and the reality behind what three-year-olds think this is what the left is after right and then you say what do these things have in common attacked men attack women attack gender attack all of these things and the one thing that's in the middle is family right because when you're encouraging children to change their genders and to go through sex change surgeries right the decision that they cannot reverse later in life what you are basically saying as these kids will not be able to have offspring right all of these things are related to the breakdown of family they want the family unit gone because that is the thing that has made western civilization the strongest the nuclear family unit is under attack in this country right now when government becomes god right that is what they want they want us to pray to government for all of the answers when there's a problem it is why i was the most vocal person out of the gate about cobin 19. everyone was scared left and right candace tweets in february not doing this not playing this game i've been on a plane i've been traveling i've been shaking hands i've been hugging people because i know what that is when the government starts trying to tell you how to live okay [Music] fear is always the mechanism to control right fear they will say something that you just go well we can't possibly challenge that and the left is great at that by the way right i was one of the first people again left to right and got killed by both sides the second the me too hashtag started trending i said nope i know what that's about people said how could you can this is about sexual assault this is about rape i said that's the point the left has found something that everybody is uncomfortable challenging right you who would want to challenge any uh you know a hashtag me to this half who would want to be the person to say this is wrong right well me because i believe in due process right and i saw this hashtag happening in the me too and i said this is going to be the way the left takes down any man woman that they want to in a second because they're now removing due process right how simple it is to remove due process and i talk about this in my book but is there any community that should have been louder against the metoo movement than black america did we not learn the lesson of what happens when allegations go unchecked do we not remember what happened to emmett till how dare we allow the left to again say no matter what believe women hashtag blanket believe women i mean what an absurd idea you should never hashtag believe women you should never hashtag believe men you should always hashtag believe facts okay believe facts and so they find these vulnerable points and they get more extreme every single time you know they and then people don't realize it until it's gone too far everyone's shy to say and then suddenly you look at brett kavanaugh and then you go whoa that happened very quickly right now we understand what they're really after and it's the answer is always power it's always power and the coven 19 just came it was just too well packaged the timing for me it's like wow so um we can't come together we can't do this we can't come together we can't see one another you're saying we all have to stay home by ourselves and rely on the mainstream media narrative to know what's going on outside the one thing they have wanted full control of the narrative is exactly what you're handed when people can no longer go out and have experiences this is what you call plato's allegory of the cave right and and for those of you that don't know that story um plato wrote a story called the allegory of the cave and it essentially says it's a story about three prisoners who are hung up on a wall and there's a fire behind them their entire lives they're hung they're hung up and they believe that the shadows on the wall are real that this is reality there can be no different reality and people are putting shapes behind the fire and they have no idea what life is outside of the cave right and suddenly one of them gets freed and they go outside and he burns his eyes and then suddenly he starts to see reality for what it is he sees the trees he sees the sky he sees everything outside he's oh my goodness what i thought was reality wasn't reality but i have to go back and tell them i have to go back and tell the remaining two prisoners of what's really outside i've now had this experience i understand what reality is right and so he goes back inside and he tells the prisoners and his eyes are burning and they and they look at him and they say you're crazy don't touch us we don't want to be cut down that can't possibly be true this is reality in front of us and they mock him and they call him crazy and i say that that allegory which i discuss in my book is so much of what it's like to be a black conservative today right because we've made it out of the cave we know what reality is the people whose hands are still tied up looking at the shadows on the cave the shadows being created by cnn by msnbc by nbc telling them that this is what you need to fear this is what's real this is what you're going through that is a lie get outside and step into the sunlight right that is the challenge as americans to encourage people to never allow someone else to control your narrative and i said all the time you know when i first decided that i was going to listen just listen not listen to a a reproduction of what he said but just listen directly to what the president said i was shocked after watching a full speech and then going and listening to what the mainstream media turned it into right how could i ever trust them with any story ever again i have to trust my experiences the mainstream media had created for me a reality that didn't exist about conservatism they lied and this is this is not just the mainstream media the way they've done it has been brilliant and you have to give credit to the left where credit is due it was machiavelli and what they did right first they realized that you have to attack every pillar and every structure that makes sense to people so they attack god right first and foremost you have to remove god you have to remove faith this is why in the media they routinely mock christians right they they say there's something wrong with christianity you're jesus freak your bible gun tell in you know this is this is all wrong right they mock that because then once you remove god then you've got family and they've destroyed family and when they did that to black america they knew what would happen you see when you remove the family when you remove anything a vacuum exists and something's got to fill that vacuum something's got to fill that hole right and for the black youth it was easy instead instead of getting that maternity and paternity inside the home you have to pursue it somewhere else so you pursue it on the streets so you pursue it via culture suddenly you look up one day and you're taking advice from cardi b and jay-z and beyonce to tell you how you should think and how you should vote suddenly cardi b is creating the shadows on the cave for you right telling you what you need to fear and you believe it because you've lost direction because you don't have those pillars of strength behind you because you don't have your mother and your father on the dinner table telling you what the truth is right the left understood that what they did was brilliant and this is why they control hollywood this is why they control culture this is why taylor swift says it's her mission to do this and and get you know conservatives out of office this is why cardi b is sitting down with bernie sanders and and joe biden because that is the evil that is the puppetry they understand we will use these idols that have become mom and dad to control the masses right and then they did the last thing which was so important they controlled the education system right everything that you learn in school i mean the department of education should be abolished it should be abolished the 1619 project handing out to kids in first grade packages packets about white privilege right this is a serious story i have two little girls that i used to nanny for they're twins they're now 16 and they attend an elite high school private school in manhattan and they are conservative and they told me that on the first day of school they're introduced to their safe space right um and that they are all required to take a class in multicultural class where every white person is encouraged to go around the room and talk about why they feel guilty for being white right and i'm sitting here thinking in my head if you ever need to know if something is racist and wrong just switch the races right would it be acceptable if you made every black person go around in class and tell you why it was wrong that they were black that would be psychotic that would be racist so yes it's racist when you make white kids do that too okay this is the game i play to decide what is right and what is wrong when i go on to my twitter and i see an article from buzzfeed it'll the title will be this is why white people need to shut up so i play the game would this article be racist if it said this is why black people need to just shut up the answer is yes it's racist take it down right it's that simple we've been led to believe that racism only works one way no racism is racism okay it is racism [Music] and the reason the reason it has gotten this far is not just because the mainstream media is treating black americans like we are toddlers right it's not just because they're infantilizing us and they're telling us suddenly that it's fine if you act like a baby it's fine if you're screaming and yelling that's normal it's not normal if how would you like it if i came into your house and you had a toddler and he was throwing a tantrum and he was throwing things in the house and i said that's fine you're just expressing yourself right that's just a little bit of expression right that would be crazy that child would that child would burn down the house that's exactly correct and yet suddenly on a mass scale grown adults are being told that even if they riot and loot it's peaceful it's peaceful protesting or it's understandable protesting right it's all understandable protesting but the fault is not black america's the fault is actually i thought about this and i sat down and i had a chat with ben shapiro you know the scary one that shouldn't be on college campuses um and i said actually after reading shelby steele's white guilt the fault is actually on the white americans that have felt so guilty about something they've never done an era that they haven't lived in and allowed this to go on right when people ask me what can change jesus white people find a voice because i would never allow my child to sit in the class and go around the room and be told there's something wrong with their skin color i would be suing the school yesterday i would never allow it to happen i understand the fear i understand the conditioning i unders i understand the smear and reliable of being called a racist trust me no one understands it better than me believe it or not i've probably been called a white supremacist more than all of you [Music] but fear once again going back to my earlier point you should never allow fear to control you right you should never allow fear we understand every person in this room understands the difference between right and wrong the left and the right used to agree on some basic principles of right and wrong both sides used to understand that rioting and looting and burning down property that you don't own is wrong that is no longer both sides used to understand that racism whether it's coming from white people or it's coming from black people is wrong but that has changed right we now have a media we have a we have politicians and we have an ecosystem of people that are pretending they don't understand the difference between right right and wrong that they don't understand there's something fundamentally wrong about ten-year-olds twerking on a netflix special right so it is time as a collective right that i promise you that i will parent my children i promise you that the blessed tears in this room that we see ourselves as the next generation of black americans a proud group that see themselves as americans first and foremost and the challenge for white americans is to stop seeing yourself as white americans only but as americans first and foremost who understand the difference between right and wrong and i will leave you with this you know and i say it every time i'm on stage but i learned those differences between right and wrong from my grandfather um and he is the greatest man breathing i'm not biased i'm not biased he really is and for him the reason why i could never take this narrative and believe and see myself as a victim is because i have a grandfather that is still breathing who lived through real issues who lived through real segregation who grew up on a segregated south plantation who grew up on a sharecropping farm who grew up at the age of five years old his first job laying out tobacco to dry he wasn't allowed to go to school because he had to work he had to work the farm he grew up with the real kkk spraying bullets inside of his home at night and him and his brothers would run to the back of the house when they'd come around and to this day my grandfather you asked him about that and as smirk crosses his face and with pride he says and my daddy would grab the shotgun and shoot back at them boys [Applause] boys boys what an insult to the legacy of the ku klux klan right boys diminished removing the power right removing the power from the real racists never seeing himself as a victim he really speaks with such a power and a strength that i couldn't imagine being the next generation generations off from that and seeing myself as less than right the generation that ended world war ii the generation who ran to the back of the house while their daddy would grab the shotgun and shoot back at them boys that is the culture of american values that i crave the strength the power the resilience that we are all capable of in this room right but we have to find the strength to speak up and speak out if it's wrong it's wrong [Music] if they call you a racist so what if you're black and they call you a white supremacist laugh laugh it's so ridiculous let's stop giving power to the left let's stop the situation that we're in today where the left is making the rules we're playing by them and they're playing by none they're playing by none let's stop doing that because if we don't we're going to wake up one day and we're not going to have a country to save right if you don't find your voice and realize that right now this time in america is so critical right if you don't look back at past generations with pride generations like my grandfather who now as a retired man lives on that sharecropping farm purchased it and is the owner of it that story the story of my grandfather is the american dream the american dream that if you work hard never once in his entire life have i ever heard my grandfather say a negative word about a white person despite living through the horrors right he always just says you know what that was just a different time baby that's what he always said just a different time right because it was a different time that is not the america that we are living in today and how he got ahead is the same way that every person can get ahead there's there's no hacks or shortcuts in life it's very simple what unites us all is not a skin color it's not even a language believe it or not what unites us all in this room is the american philosophy the american philosophy is that you can come to this country with the clothes on your back barely speaking the language but if you are willing to work hard and stay out of trouble you can make something of yourself that is what we fight to protect every single day so ladies and gentlemen i leave you with that to remember that the blexit slogan is we are the free we the free god bless thank you guys so much for having me", "jZ7wWnzkEEY": "the Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all what happens to a dream deferred does it dry up like A Raisin in the Sun or fester like a sore and then Ron does it stink like rotten meat or crust and sugar over like a syrupy sweet maybe it just sags like a heavy load or does it explode [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage in North Carolina's native and candidate for lieutenant governor Martin Robinson [Music] [Applause] [Music] Wow hey what's going on man it's always crazy when you see people on Facebook mostly and then you see them live and you're like wow so uh guys let's get right into this cuz I don't want to hold anybody up the very first thing I'm going to do before I do anything else and I do this all the time I'm gonna give thanks and the very first things I'm going to give us to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ my purpose on this stage today isn't to enrage the left so let's go ahead and get it started with that I'm giving thanks to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he does not get booed in this room he gets glorified in this room he gets glorified by those who believe him in this room and know that he is the reason why this nation is a blessed and free and independent nation so I'm gonna give him thanks first and foremost because he saw fit to put breath in my lungs he's seen fit to put food in my mouth I guess you could see that can't you he seemed fit to feed all of us and take care of all our family so give him thanks first and foremost that's number one the number two i'ma give thanks to my wife over here she's sitting here we've been married thirty years this year we have two wonderful children and a wonderful two-year-old grandson and a and a granddaughter on the way so I give her thanks as well and then my campaign manager is in here somewhere hiding his name is Conrad thank you to Conrad and thank you to all my staff and all that good stuff folks we're not going to talk about that campaign today not going to talk about that here's what we're going to talk about again what we're going to talk about I told you I'm here today to make the left mad and here's how you make the left man you make the left mad when you got brown skin and your own mind and your self determining you make the left mad when you stand with your two feet planted firm and declare that you are an American not an African American not any kind of hyphenated American not half of an American you are American you are old everything that that Constitution spells out you are old everything that our government has promised us you are an American there's one thing that I have learned in a book as a black man in this country and no it's not that George Washington was a racist no is not that Confederacy is the worst thing that ever happened in this nation the thing that I have learned in this nation if there is no one who despises me because of my black skin more than a leftist who knows that I'm self-determining that I believe in the tenets of the Bible which are the Word of God that I believe in the Constitution of the United States of America that I know that this in this place my people have thrived more in this place than any other place on earth and it is our birthright it is our birthright to have a piece of this place all those folks out there they are teaching our children that Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were slave owners and thereby biggest and unworthy of Honor those that are trying to teach folks that we should tear down Confederate monuments because they spell out bigotry those that are moving on and saying that we shouldn't honor our veterans because they've gone across the ocean and killed little brown people all of those folks are doing that for one reason because they know that if freedom reigns if liberty reigns and the minds of the people of this nation they cannot be tyrants they cannot be tyrants where liberty reigns but folks we got some work to do in that area you see we got some some idiots out there that are trying to call this place a democracy folks this is a constitutional republic this is not a democracy in a democracy the mob rules but in a constitutional republic it is the people who rule but again we have some work to do the major tenant of a republic specifically a constitutional republic is this it is not Liberty it is not freedom it is not our rights the major tenant of a constitutional republic is responsibility because where there is no responsibility there will be no freedom and that's in anything that we do if you're not financially responsible you won't have any money for long if you leave this place and refuse to be legally responsible you won't have your physical freedom for long the freedoms that we have in this republic come expressly from our responsibility and we have a responsibility to be politically active folks looking around here at this crowd right now and that's what I see I see when I look out at this crowd I just don't see a crowd of people who just came out here to cheer and jump up and down you guys are here because you're aware and you're active and you're being responsible to stand up for this Republic and the tenants that it stands for now let's get a little bit more specific with specific with this thing not Pacific that's an ocean their grammar nazi' in the house let's get specific with this thing I'm gonna say something else that's going to make the left furious because I'm going to speak directly to my own and yes I have an own you see my own came over and chips in the belly of the ship we didn't get to ride on the top deck at that point we weren't self-determining we were locked in Chains we were put into the belly of ships and we spent that long miserable trip called the Middle Passage we came to this land in bondage and there were many folks that came that travel those trips some 12 million some 12 million folks in 400 years traveled across the ocean to come here for the purposes of being slaves you know our leftist friends would tell us we should be ashamed of that but i'ma stand right here on this stage and tell you I'm not ashamed that because if there's ever been a story of victory in this world it's the story of black folks in this country of people who not only survived slavery we not only survived slavery we thrived after it we reached from the slave Shack to the White House in this nation in less than 200 years show me another nation on earth they can claim such we are strong and powerful people we are a strong and powerful people but to hear some folks tell it we're too stupid to make our way down to get a free ID to protect my vote we're too stupid to know which bathroom to use we're too we're too stupid to know that the child and that woman's belly is a blessing from God and not a burden from the devil so to my people I'm saying this and I'm talking directly to you it is time in this nation for you to get up off of your knees and claim your rightful place as masters in your homes in your mirrors in your communities in your states and in this nation the folks who travel that middle passage and took no strikes and bled their blood and gave their lives for you didn't do it so you could walk down the street with your pants hanging off your behind with your hat turned sideways not caring what day it is allowing your children to come up like weeds those folks died for you so you could be kings and queens in this place and accept your rightful place as heads of your families folks it's time it is time for black folks in this nation to make a mass exodus from the left that is trying to destroy us because make no mistake about it the only thing they want you to do after walk it after making that long journey from the belly of those shifts to those cotton fields and then through Jim Crow they want you to turn around and go right back into bondage but folks we cannot do that you see because God gave us a promised land and he put us in it and the only thing that we have to do is obey Him believe him and we could walk into it and it is time for us to do it the days of excuses are over you see because what the what the left wants you to be is a victim that's what they sell you they sell you victimization they sell you police brutality they tell you you can can't do anything but earn minimum wage they tell you the whole world is against you see what we want to do what we want to do is tell you the exact opposite you're not a victim you're Victor and you're already a victim you're already a victim because somebody has already won the victory for you somebody's already broken their heel and cracked their leg busting down the door of oppression so that you could walk through it the problem is too many of us have become too lazy and complacent and indifferent to simply take that step through that threshold folks that's got to change we got to start preaching the gospel of victory over victimization we've got to start telling our folks that you don't have to earn minimum wage as a matter of fact you should never turn your head towards minimum wage you should always have your head turned away from it you should be maximizing your potential not worrying about somebody throwing you money at the bottom and black men about to say something else to beat those folks on the Left don't like black men it's time for you to get off the streets that go home ain't gonna miss my words when I say it I'm tired of seeing young black men dodge their responsibilities as husbands and fathers and leaders in their communities and heads of their household and yeah I said heads of their household you're the head because God holds you responsible for how your family for how your family Falls it's time for us to pull up our pants buckle them up real tight around our waist stick up stick out our chests March back home and tell that woman that had your baby I'm back and I'm gonna take this burden off of you because I'm the one that's responsible for you I'm the one that's responsible for this child I'm the one that's responsible for this household I am the one that's responsible for this community I am the one that's responsible for this city and I am the one that's responsible for this state it is time for us to take our rightful head as the kings of our homes as God intended now I say that to black men because of course I am a black man and the left despises when we speak to our own and try to encourage them in the right way to go but folks that message is meant for all of us that is meant for all of us you know I mentioned that we're a constitutional republic and that we have that responsibility to stand up and be the rightful masters of this nation folks that call goes out to every one of us these days of laying back and watching CNN and saying that's a shame that is over that is over we see it the highest levels of government now folks that could've took their millions and went off and went lived on an island and watched this nation burn but because they felt a sense of responsibility they stopped and turned around and said I cannot and now they're laying down their lives got us in here wearing these red hats talking about make America great again and that's exactly what's happening people ask all the time and make America great when was America our Great America has been great through all of her worst times folks matter of fact that's when America was at her greatest America was at her greatest win it looked like she was knocked out for the count when the count was at eight but she got back up again and came out swinging but she could only do it folks if we take that responsibility seriously folks are loved to say I don't do politics don't do it don't do politics he'll sure do you so folks I'm gonna leave you with this today no matter what you do no matter how you feel about anything I may have seen you have got to understand one thing that you were born into a free nation that allows you to determine who you're going to be what your going to be and how you gonna get there but the only way that's going to happen is you take that long look in the mirror and ask yourself am i bred to be responsible for which way this nation goes am i ready to be responsible for whether or not my children and my grandchildren of corporate freedom or whether they'll grow up under socialism or tyranny when you answer that question the very next thing you need to do is thank God that he gave you the ability to even ask the question to yourself and have the option because it is because of him that we rise every morning in a free nation it's because of him that we rise every day in a free nation folks I encourage all of you get active stay active and don't give up the fight because this is really not up to any president it's not any L to any senator saving this republic this constitutional republic it's just like Benjamin Franklin said when he told that lady outside of the hall he told her we've given you a republic if you can keep it I believe you all pants thank you very much guys thank you for your time god bless the state of North Carolina and god bless the United States of America [Applause]", "yKsUp0Ar6EM": "hello facebook hello from what is supposed to be maternity leave i'm supposed to not be doing social media and enjoying these last two weeks before i give birth to my daughter i'm huge i feel like i'm huge at least um very exciting times but obviously i wanted to come back and just do a video talking about today talking about this historic decision and talking about all of these protests that are going to follow which are quite meaningless because the decision has already been made but you know we live in a time where people think that throwing temper tantrums and they don't get what they want is appropriate i want to make this video particularly to women that are pro-choice and i hope that if you are pro-choice you'll listen to this with an open heart and if you're pro-life that you will just simply share it in the hopes that somebody who is pro-choice does see it um i have always been very sympathetic and empathetic to women that are pro-choice because i used to be pro-choice for the majority of my life i was pro-choice until i was 25 years old almost maybe a little before a little after before i got into politics and started really doing my own research and kind of getting out of the what i would describe to be the cultural and the educational bubble meaning that i went to public school my entire life um there is one side of this political argument that is presented at public schools and it is pro-choice um i went to off to college and took a feminism course and there was one side that is presented when you go off to university and it is pro-choice the concept of my body my choice a phrase that i don't even know where it came from was supplanted into my head before i even had a thought or an understanding of my own i never learned about adoption in school i actually grew up in a time when i learned that it was a clump of cells and it wasn't even a baby and so when i went to college you know girls that i was very close with got abortions and i know what these women went through and i find the arguments that come from the pro-life side to be just sometimes not even arguments and just very um unsympathetic to the fact that women are actively learning that this is a choice they're actively learning that this isn't a baby um and when you say to those young women that you're a murderer right you're just a murderer it's not helpful because you're not understanding that these women are brainwashed i was brainwashed for years throughout school intentionally by an education system by programs that were put into place by planned parenthood beginning in the 1970s to believe that it was just a clump of cells and that having a lot of sexual activity was fine as a young female and that uh you know abortion was no different than like a more drastic form of birth control not only that but i learned that it was the responsible thing to do so i've always tried to understand that mindset of a woman because i i know these women that went and got abortions and i know that these are not terrible human beings that are murderers what i say to pro-choicers if you're still pro-choice is i want you to be realistic about why you're pro-choice and i want you to be sincere in your arguments of why you're pro-choice right it is foolish to say that this is about protecting women's rights as i said i have about six friends that have gotten abortions and out of six of them five of them were not doing it because it was their choice but were doing it because they had pressure from boyfriends because they had pressure from parents or because they were scared these are women in their most vulnerable states that they could possibly be in they're not doing this because they think oh i just don't want to have a kid they're doing this because pressure is coming from all around them they have teachers that are telling them that their lives will be ruined if they have a child too soon and they don't have the economic standing to have a child in many circumstances they have boyfriends who never wanted the children and who are demanding that they get an abortion i have been in situations where people in my family have had boyfriends that have broken into their homes demanding that they get an abortion domestic violence um follows a lot of these situations you have seen circumstances in the news recently where a woman in philadelphia was shot at her baby shower by her baby daddy because he didn't want to have the child this is the more typical circumstances of women getting an abortion it is something that is done out of fear uh these women are terrified when they go to these clinics these women are crying when they come out of these clinics these women are not doing this as some form of form of freedom so i wish that if you are going to be legitimate about the pro-choice movement you would acknowledge that this is not something that is about reproductive freedom or helping women my second hope is that you would acknowledge the true history of this in talking about how this benefits men and their ability to demand of women that they get an abortion that they take this option many women who are scared and who are vulnerable that you recognize that this decision was made by men entirely made by men the supreme court decision was passed by seven white men it is completely foolish for people to be a pro-choicer and to pretend that this is setting women's rights back when women were never able to speak on this issue in the first place it was decided by men the textbooks were then written by men you know and orchestrated by men to convince them that this was the right thing to do and women are still living under this delusion that somehow women's rights are being reversed when these were never rights that were decided by women including the woman the woman that was at the core of rory reid in the first place who reversed her decision and you know ended her life saying that she was pro-life and felt that this decision was wrong um that was made on her behalf so you can look into the history of that one of the things that another thing that really bothers me about the pro-choice movement um is this failure to recognize the history and you see a lot right now across social media people are saying this is a racist decision i'm specifically calling out amy schumer who alleged that this was what slave uh slave holders would have wanted first and foremost i'm i think people are really getting tired i know i certainly have been tired for a long time but i'm hopeful that after the black lives matter riots that black america is waking up to this thing that when white privileged women want something they somehow make it they say well if i don't get it it's racist um that's a ridiculous circumstance if you are going to put on your profile please donate to planned parenthood um because this decision has been overturned then i expect you as a pro-choicer to recognize the true history of planned parenthood to recognize that it was created by a eugenicist that the entire concept of abortion was created during the progressive era a woman you know largely led by margaret sanger at the time that they were also performing appendectomies to black people to make sure that they couldn't give birth who wanted to use abortion as a mechanism to get rid of undesirables so if they thought that a certain class of people should not procreate and you can go back and you could read margaret sanger's writings you know they were they were considered unfits in society black people they did not want them to procreate and have families so they encouraged them uh to get abortions and then told that this was the right decision for them to make it wasn't just black people by the way uh during that time it was largely people that were from uh southern europe italians were considered undesirables um as well as uh the east of europe as well that were coming into the country and they and they were fearful that if these people began to mate and have children that it would drive down the nordic race and there was a book at that time that was the most popular book which was written by madison grant and it was called the passing of the great race the entire abortion industry was created around the idea of eugenicism but it is it is a planned parenthood is a racist organization and they have been successful you can't just say oh well it changed going forward she wrote down what her plans were what what her models were why abortion needed to be taking place that you had people that weren't worthy of having children to be able to reproduce you can't just magically pretend that didn't happen and say oh well well then i learned in school but now it's my body my choice acknowledge the true history the true abhorrent history of what the abortion industry is what it was intended to do and what it has largely been successful in doing i think margaret sanger is one of the most successful uh progressives that have ever has ever lived because she set out to do what exactly what has been accomplished um over 18 million black babies have been aborted the black population would be double today um had it had it not been for planned parenthood had not been for abortion um and the truth is that planned parenthood clinics are 70 of them are in minority neighborhoods now you may find that fact checkers on the internet will say that that's not true and that they looked at a study and saw and this is what they will say and this is how tricky they are because they want to obscure the truth that the majority of places uh that perform abortion performing service services are not primarily in minority neighborhoods specifically i'm talking about planned parenthood clinics when you say abortion performing services you're talking about every single hospital and they try to widen that map and pretend that oh well no see look hospitals are also here and here and all these clinics are here no planned parenthood clinics the majority of them are in majority minority neighborhoods and that again is something that was intended again i am not going to fault you if you hear all of these things and you say well i'm still pro-choice it doesn't matter but it you you have to be honest about your arguments be sincere in your arguments don't pretend this is about a woman's choice this is about a woman being peer pressured don't pretend this is this is not a life this is another thing of learning that it was a clump of cells pregnant now um and during my first pregnancy when i was seven weeks and i went in and because they have this you know 5d technology where you can zoom in on the baby i saw my baby's arms dancing and his legs dancing and i broke down crying um just because of the elation and but also a quiet sadness and realizing that my entire life i had been lied to throughout the education system that i was unintentionally raised up in an educational cult that wanted me to be the opposite of what a woman should be i are i believe firmly that our role as women um is to defend children is to raise children is to love children to nurture children uh to protect them from evil in this world and when women are out on the front lines demanding a right to end the life of children that they perceive to be inconvenient um we we have to accept that we have been brainwashed into a cult that's it and it is difficult for me to even speak this now as i'm due to give birth in two weeks because i think to feel this child cooking inside of me to feel this little girl coming inside of me and then to hear women say that they believe that this isn't a life that this isn't a life that should be valued to already know that i know my daughter's personality like i knew my son's personality in the womb i knew exactly who my son was it's it's so spiritual it is so above politics this connection that women have with children um and it starts long before you're holding a child in your stomach it starts when your kid and you are holding a baby doll and you're you're nurturing it it starts when you watch little toddler girls taking care of their little brothers and being so careful um it is it is above politics it's it's it's who we are as spiritual beings and so many of us have that spirituality systematically removed from us in the school system before we even get a chance to form our own thoughts again i feel like i'm talking to you as a former member of that cult of pro-choiceness and uh and i and i do say this empathetically because i think it's sad when you look around and you see so many women that don't realize that um fighting for life is is all that matters when we're talking about the life of a child and the chance to live and to to really understand that using extreme arguments to to say oh but what if you know if a woman is raped then this should be you know we should only be arguing according to women that are raped well let me tell you something of the six friends that i know that had an abortion nobody was raped you know people were having unprotected sex because what's the point of practicing safe sex when you're being systematically taught in the school system that doesn't matter you can just go get an abortion it's easy it's become a form of birth control and we need to acknowledge that honestly and openly that the reason these abortions are happening is not because tons of women are getting raped it's because tons of women are being irresponsible along with their partners and because tons of men don't want to raise up and be responsible and they just say to women go get an abortion so many of these women are affected long after they get these abortions i've received tons of letters from these women and i want to welcome those women to the pro-life movement like you can change your mind you you can have had an abortion and you can be a spokesperson for the pro-life movement you don't have to permanently be a person that pickets for these extreme um uh organizations that demand a right to abort a child nine months in the womb and that's what's going to happen unfortunately in closing what i think is going to happen now obviously is first and foremost it will be sent down to the states women that want to get abortions will cross state lines women that are living in liberal states and governments bodies in these liberal states like new york city will are going to pass very extreme abortion laws probably until the kids three years old and say it's your your child your choice and then the opposite will happen in red states they will ban abortions and i think what will be interesting will be to look at the data you know it will be interesting to look at red states that choose to ban abortion outright and to see whether or not it curbs teen pregnancies whether or not just knowing that it's not an option makes women pursue safer sex you know makes women say actually okay if the outcome of this is going to be a child i need to be very serious about the partners that i have we've become such a promiscuous society um that people don't take their relationship seriously at all um and they feel that it's it's up to the government to take care of their that when they make poor decisions take care of it you know um and it it has contributed to the circumstance that we're in today we are honestly uh we are america is out of control when it comes to abortion we have abortion policies that mirror north korea nowhere else in the world is like this my my husband is english he looks at these women in america and thinks that that are marching and demanding to trying to kill supreme court justices and and thinks that they're rabid and he's correct something has gone amiss in america it was time to pull this back and it's time for us to have more honest and open conversations so if you are pro-choice i hope that you um listen and just are willing to have an open conversation if you are pro-life i hope that um you share this video because there could be someone who is like me and doesn't you know has never even considered any of these points and just needs to hear a different perspective that is a bit more empathetic than being called a murderer so thank you guys for watching share and i'm gonna go have this baby", "z5ATINaBzKo": "[Applause] well thanks everybody Wow well I tell you you all make me want to say praise the Lord listen God bless each and every one of you I'm so glad to see you all out here today you know tomorrow's Veterans Day I want to thank every veteran in the room tonight this afternoon thank you for your service to this great country thank you thank you god bless each and every one of you thank you thank you now you know I served in the United States Marine Corps hoorah set for five and and you know one of the things that I love about military service is that there is a unifying mission about it isn't there I mean when you know that you could potentially face combat with your fellow Marine your fellow soldier your fellow Navy person you don't care about the color of their skin you don't care what part of the country they came from the only thing you know is that you've got each other's backs and you know what our country could learn a lot from the military right now it's about time we came together and started having each other's backs instead of trying to tear each other apart [Applause] now look I just came here from Virginia and we're in some we're in some very serious wars in Virginia you may know about our governor there I ran against our governor for lieutenant governor and when we had a debate on television I reached out to shake his hand he refused to shake my hand I tapped him on the side to get his attention he refused to even acknowledge I was there later on they found him with a picture of a blue Klux Klan outfit and blackface and then shortly thereafter we heard him say that he supports abortion and if I tell is intended to be aborted and that child is born alive well I think we can then decide whether we want to let that child die or not that's governor Ralph Northam or Virginia he's supposed to be a pediatrician I'll tell you what I wouldn't trust him with a born child let alone an unborn child he has just gotten the legislature to go along with him unfortunately on Tuesday we elected a legislature that will back him but I'm here for Virginia to tell you all that the state of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry and James Madison and James Monroe and George Mason is not going to lie down and roll over and turn our Commonwealth over to a bunch of Marxist and socialists we're going to bring Virginia back from the brink now my family comes from Virginia my great-grandparents were slaves and sharecroppers in Orange County Virginia my grandfather was raised there he later left and I was born in Pennsylvania I was born into a broken home I was raised until the age of 10 in foster care and my father came back into my life at the age of 10 years old I was raised up in poverty I ate bad a sandwiches sometimes and biscuits and served for dinner but my father came back into my life and he turned my life around I was a juvenile delinquent I was running the streets I was not paying attention I didn't want anybody to have any authority over me because I resented the fact that my parents weren't there and I'm telling you everybody's got a solution to our social problems we need to control guns we need to have more programs but you know what we need an America we need to get men back in the home we need to get families raising their children and teaching them right from wrong and respect for authority [Applause] that's what happened for me my beloved father made all the difference in the world in my life and you know what else he told me and my father was born in 1915 he was raised in a very different racial climate than anything I've ever experienced but my beloved father told me when I was a young boy he took me to live with him he said son this is the United States of America he said it's not a perfect place he said but you can be anything you want to be in this country if you make up your mind that you want to do it my father had a sixth grade education was a third-class welder and son ship building and drydock company but he raised up a son we took out of foster care I graduated summa Lord from the University of Massachusetts and from Harvard Law School because in America you can start from nowhere and become something and make something out of yourself I am tired of having liberals tell me what I can't be tell me where I can't go tell me what I can't do I'm tired of being treated like I'm some kind of handicapped second-class citizen I want to tell every black citizen every Hispanic citizen don't you let liberals tell you what you cannot do you can do anything you make up your mind to do this is the best place in the world to live you've been blessed to be born in the United States of America and no we're not a perfect country I know that but you know I've made up my mind at this time in this state in in this day and age anybody who's so dumb that they were judge a person by the color of their skin you don't need to worry about them anyway my brothers and sisters we live look this is not heaven I know that I'll preach about heaven this is not heaven but you compare it to any place else in the world that's why we don't have people standing at our borders saying please don't leave please don't leave in fact I tell you some of these folks I'd like to say please leave because even those who complain though this is the greatest nation on earth we live under the most successful governing document in the history of mankind constitutions are changed around the world about every 17 years here we are 230 years under the Constitution of the United States and we're going to keep this constitutional republic that was given to us by our founding fathers I [Applause] raised my hand at a Marine Corps office in August of 1970 I took an oath to the Constitution of the United States that I would preserve protect and defend it against all enemies foreign and domestic and bear true faith and allegiance of the same every veteran in here took that same oath I have more commitment to it now because I believe it's in more danger now than it's ever been and my brothers and sisters are Benjamin Franklin walk out of the Constitutional Convention September 17 1787 a woman named mrs. Powell met him and he asked she asked him well doctor what have you given us a monarchy or Republic he said a republic you can keep it and I'm telling you all by the grace of Almighty God with everything that's in me we're going to keep it nobody's taking it away from us but my brothers and sisters we've got to have unity we've got to get past this racial division this this division over racism and sexism we've got to be one nation under God and then we'll be indivisible with liberty and justice for all that's why I don't mind confessing to you at I know my history I know my background I know the African heritage that I have but I'm telling you all this I do not call myself an african-american I am an American our ancestors may have come on different ships but we're all in the same boat now and we better start acting like it and so I just want to encourage you don't don't give up don't back down stand up for what you believe in those of us who are of African descent know that we've got a challenge to help people understand who come from our backgrounds or similar backgrounds to help them understand you've been lied to you've been manipulated you've been used they're keeping your children and not accredited schools that are miss educating them they're keeping you locked in ghettos they're destroying families they are boarding your babies it's time for us to tell them we need to be free let my people go [Applause] so my brothers and sisters I am convinced that America's best days are ahead I mean that when I look out and see you all I know that's got to be true my daughter's here my beloved youngest daughters here and she was raised up to do something with her life she doesn't walk around thinking people won't let her do this and they won't let her do that she just got her Executive MBA from one of the schools here because that's America that's what I taught my children that but what we're doing we're doing for you younger people see I'm I look my mind that the Sun is going down in assets on my life I'm in my third quarter but I see some of you are in your first quarter and we want to make sure that the country that we leave you is one where you can be who you are be proud of who you are stand up who you are and not be told oh you believe that oh get out of our way are you believe in marriage you believe your mother and father were yeah yes I believe in marriage is God and whoa wait a minute wait a minute you're bigoted you're hater are you believe in the free market system no no no we need socialism oh you you believe people ought to come together and care about one another regardless of race or color or creed or any such thing as Americans oh no no no no you don't understand the white man is against us all we don't want our children raised up in a country like that where they're taught to hate one another be against one another we want to be raised in a country where they know as a fellow citizen we care about one another we don't need the government to order us to care about our labor we ought to care about our neighbor because it's the right thing to do I want these young people to be able to feel the same thing we feel yes I'm a patriot you can get you can sense that to feel the same thing I feel when they hear that national anthem and look at that flag and get emotional about it because I know the blood that's been shared I know the tears that have been shared I know the sacrifices that have been made I know the lives that have been given in order to secure this unique Liberty that we have in this country and I want them to feel what we feel when we look at those symbols the flag is not a racist symbol it represents my country in your country and if we can't rally around the symbols that represent us all we've got a future do we have and please don't let me get started because when when a spoiled multi-millionaire who couldn't make that kind of money in any other country on ours has got the nerve to tell me that because he's got an issue he won't stand for the flag or they won't stand for the flag or they won't stand for the national anthem I'll tell you what as far as I'm concerned find yourself a country you like better and go there and don't come back don't disrespect my flag don't disrespect my country there are some things about my country that I want to change yes but I love America because I know what America means to all of us we have created the most successful most prosperous country raise the standard of living for more people than any other nation that's ever existed on the face of the earth I know we endured eight years of apologies for America but I'll tell you what I don't care how you feel about him thank God now we got a president who doesn't apologize for our country but it's proud of America loves our country and let me tell you something folks there's nothing racist about putting America first this is my home of course I put my own country first so don't be afraid to stand up be encouraged because I really believe that truth forever on the scaffold wrong forever on this phone but the staff will sways the future and behind the dim unknown standeth within the shadows keeping watch over his own truth is going to win out over falsehood so keep standing because I really believe that this nation will have a new birth of freedom I saw a young man in the back wearing a second amendment shirt let me tell you something our founding fathers weren't perfect people but when they set this nation up on the basis that rights aren't given to us by the magnificence of government or by some king or potentate but they are inherent in who we are as human beings given to us by our Creator that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness they secured our rights in something that cannot be changed and yes I have a right to freedom of speech I have a right to my own conscience what is wrong with these liberals what is wrong with them because you know what I mean this with all my heart I may not agree with them but I will defend their right to say what they think I mean that why is it that they want to shut Candis down why does they want to shut us down they don't want us to be heard well I've got news for them there is no power on earth that can shut us up or shut us down we're going to keep crying aloud we're going to keep saying it until nobody but nobody disagrees with us we're gonna keep persuading people that america is the land of the free and the home of the brave [Applause] that's right USA USA USA USA USA now I might be running out of time so let me let me finish up this nation is going to have a new birth of freedom because of you because of you and let me tell you something to all of my brothers and sisters who happen to be of darker hue when we start uniting not on the basis of what somebody looks like but on the basis of what they think like when we start uniting on the basis of ideas and principles and ideals we will break the back of the leftists who want to turn this country into a Marxist socialist nation cuz they're guaranteed they're trying to guarantee their power by manipulating black folks and Hispanic folks and women and convincing us that we're victims of racism and sexism but I want you to say aloud and not backup I am nobody's victim of racism I refuse to be a victim of anybody for any reason [Applause] I'm a proud American who happens to be black if you want me to bend over and let you ride me as your victim it's not going to happen so stand up and be counted and don't back down and I guarantee you in time to come people are gonna join in with you and those young people are going to sing with with new meaning my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee I sing land where my fathers died land of the pilgrims pride from every mountainside let freedom ring keep saying it until they all come into agreement with us and say yes I believe in America I believe in what my country stands for and no we're not a perfect country but I guarantee you this we're the best place on earth to live and look don't you dare back up from that at all now Candis has experienced it I've experienced it threats nasty names you know I mean believe it enough folks I'll be up and called the white supremacist I see that's a new sellout simply because I say if you don't want to be judged by the color of your skin why would you judge someone else that way that's that's that's being a white supremacist you don't want anybody judging you on the basis that we will you your black black folks are like this but but it's okay to say well white folks are like that that's a lie that's that's that's disgusting it's it's just it's degrading we ought to reject that because that's not what the civil rights movement dr. King said we want to be judged not by the color of our skin but by the content of our count [Applause] but I hope that you will join it with me and in keeping this commitment I'm probably older than most of you in this room but it's a commitment I made a long time ago and I hope you'll join in it with me I said I don't care what anybody says about America I don't care what they say about my faith I don't care what they say about my commitment let me make something clear I love everybody there's not a person on the earth that I hate I don't care how much they disagree with me or what they say about me I love them I pray for them I tell people I didn't agree with President Obama but I pray for into tears I prayed for him to tears literally because I loved him and I still love him and pray for it but I just don't agree with him but I love people we're not against people we want the very best for people we want everybody in America to experience the very best there is but they'll call us and haters because if you don't agree well you're a bad person but you know what I don't care what they say about me I don't care what they say about our country I'll get what they say about a flag don't care what they say about our national anthem our constitution our founding fathers or our way of life I am going to stand up for that flag and stand up for that Constitution and stand up for our way of life until I breathe my dying breath but I will never give up I will never give in I will never back down I will never be silenced I'm going to do it until the Lord calls me home and I hope you have the same attitude because if we have that attitude we're going to win we're going to win god bless you god bless Atlanta god bless the United States of America [Applause]", "zYgx0mwVf7E": "so in my opinion uh george floyd was a criminal he was a criminal and just because he was a criminal doesn't mean i'd like to strike the record not my opinion definitely a fact doesn't mean that i am not going to play a part of the broken black culture that always wants to martyr criminals why are we pretending that this criminal should be upheld as a citizen uh a a of a as a martyr in black america so this entire narrative is complete smoke and mirrors it's all made up it's just election fodder it's white versus black because it's an election year not because black americans are suffering at the hands of police officers more than white americans candace owen that rotten she's the worst i can't think of a worse way to make money she's most articulate i didn't make money on that video she's so articulate she tell you how stupid she is precisely they killed him and that wasn't right so he's the guy we're not desperate for heroes in the black community any that survives this nightmare is my god damned hero so first and foremost that video i'm it's still you know is number one most viral video i've ever done which shocked me i mean it was such a casual thing i was sitting up there talking to my husband outside in dc and i was just like i can't even stand this anymore it's a bizarre thing to me because i've grown up with uncles are addicted to drugs it's very weird to me to try to turn somebody who is a drug addict turn somebody who is a criminal into a martyr it's very weird that there are murals and statues erected of george floyd at the same time that they're like they're fighting having a statue erected of clarence thomas it is really a symptom of how cancerous the black community has become so i'm talking about isn't about it i'm just like this is ridiculous i'm not gonna allow this lie to make its way around the world and i just ranted literally i was sitting on the floor in our guest bedroom and i just ranted uh you know felt like it was a blank went upstairs i think i took a nap and the video went viral as an understatement a hundred million views it was insane it was everywhere people contacting me from turkey from the uk from australia i mean celebrities everywhere were contacting me and the number one time it was thank you because they had actually bought into the media narrative because they were just seeing every night this is what's happening to black men in america was happening with black men and nobody had talked about the fact that this guy was a career criminal it is very hard to get arrested nine times you know to spend nine times in jail and in prison before you turn 40. like that is the one remarkable thing that george floyd did is that he was able to spend that much time in prison before he even turned 40. this man was a drug addict i mean he died of drug overdose everyone watched but he didn't he did you know he was obviously having a drug overdose you know what role derrick shoving played in not stopping or getting him the help he needed um is can be a matter of debate but there's no question that you i mean fentanyl in your system 50 times 50 to 100 times more deadly than morphine nobody wants to talk about that stuff so i i just wasn't gonna allow that narrative to get out um because it says at the end of the day it's just harmful it's a harmful thing to have black americans conditioned to think that every time one of your criminals dies you need to go protest and boycott for them this would never happen any other community not the jewish community when's the last march for a jewish criminal that you remember what about asian it was a lot last march for an asian criminal it doesn't happen it's just our community and it's because we have people like dave chappelle making you think that in order to prove that you're a real person and again i never i allowed i allowed dave schuspell to say what he said because i think that there does need to be a protected space for comedy um but if we're really getting at what he's implying here it's that you know it's incumbent upon every black person to defend their criminals i am just i believe the exact opposite if you are a criminal nothing to do with you if you really care about black lives and you will address the fact that this man tortured black americans entire life he spread drugs in the black community he you know was arrested for attacking a woman who had a small child uh forcing his way into her home um you know with a gun and and spent real time in prison for these things so i don't care what race you are if you're a criminal i have no time for you um i have absolutely no time for george floyd i've never edited my opinion that once um again that is that remains exclusive to my opinion on derek shobin i'm talking strictly about george floyd he was a career criminal career drug addict and he died committing crime and doing drugs so i'm just i'm candace 24 7 365 and sometimes it picks up and it goes viral but um i've never once regretted anything that's been viral internet i i say what i say and i mean it also it was kind of cool to have dave chappelle who's like one of the most famous comedians ever mentioned me so i mean that's influence", "tXA9GNnooZM": "they're promoting not abortions at nine months this is guys this is this is satan to me like this we're now at level satan in the democrat party so i want to talk a little bit about abortion because it's something that i'm i'm i'm really passionate about having this discussion and americans need to have this discussion with one another because what we're talking about right here is crazy i can't even believe this is an actual discussion in america i cannot believe that andrew cuomo the governor of new york lit up the city to celebrate the fact that you could abort a child at nine months because it took you nine months to decide you didn't want the child right who is har it is sick you're absolutely right who is harmed the most by abortion policies that's exactly right right so we have a ton we have tons of of white conservatives here and i've done a lot of speaking um in front of groups and they say how do we talk to the black community we've been smeared as racist for so long they're scared to even knock on our doors they're scared to say they're republican they're scared to say they're conservative because they've been lied on and smeared and i said you want to be a great topic to start with abortion start talking about abortion because six percent of the population black females account for almost 40 percent of all the abortions performed that's absurd because they put the clinics in our neighborhood they brainwash our schools they tell us not to keep our children and what is the result we've had 18 million black babies aborted since 1973 for those of you that don't know the black population growth has stagnated we're not growing latino populations going up the white population's going up the black population is stagnated we currently have a culture where men are routinely accused of not stepping up to the plate in fact just this week it was announced that only 18 percent of households in america today feature a nuclear family unit a married mother and a father raising children make no mistake father absence is one of the biggest if not the biggest epidemic that we face in this country today but why are we expecting menace up to the plate when we have women that are telling them that they don't have to why should men step up when the message that is ringing out loud and clear from mainstream culture and media is that beyond sex men have no responsibility or saving the lives of their children i mean how on earth can someone logically explain how a baby is 100 the property of a woman as it grows inside of her then the moment that the baby is born it requires a 50-50 split can a man stand before a judge at a child support hearing and say your honor it was her body and it was therefore her choice to have this child the answer of course is no obviously not that would be stupid if a man is colloquially referred to as a deadbeat dad for taking no part or responsibility in a child's life as he or she grows up the same must also be true for a woman who wants no part or responsibility in a child's life as it grows inside of her my body my choice is a pervasive deadbeat mom argument that accomplishes nothing but excusing too many men from stepping up to their most important role as fathers i hate that we've gotten to a place in society where we cannot have an honest conversation about what abortion is what abortion isn't and it really starts with education and the education system unfortunately keeps pushing women uh to believe that it's not a child it's a clump of cells you can do whatever you want but i can tell you as somebody who just had a child you go into at 11 weeks pregnant and you it's not even just a heartbeat on the monitor that you see because they have wonderful 4d sonograms now you can see the arms the legs and it's at that moment that you realize that the left is lying the left is just simply lying you can see the baby dancing and moving its arms and they've done this for a really long time and unfortunately i wish women just had more of an education and honest education about what it is that their", "XvhM6Jo6Er8": "with the insistence on this divisive race narrative in america uh that it's it's important that we spread the blacks message so i just first want to tell you guys what is blexit what did i mean when i meant black exit there's been a lot of media portrayals of what started this movement and it couldn't come more direct from my heart meaning that i started this movement because in 2015 i didn't care about politics at all i didn't really care much about all the debates that were going on in the media um but i had this i started realizing that increasingly the media was sort of insisting on this narrative that the only black american that was worth giving a platform to was somebody that was angry somebody that was divisive and somebody that believed that this country is a horrible backwards racist irredeemable place and it started to make me also realize that when i looked at the portrayal of black americans on tv it was a similar echo meaning that the type of black americans that were being given platforms that were being given shows were so far from the type of shows and black americans i grew up with when i grew up we were watching the cosby show we were watching will smith and the fresh prince of bel-air we were watching the winslows and family matters these wonderful wonderful shows that were at the end of the day about family right it was all about family it was it was setting our goals and our minds in a way that was so positive and so inspiring meaning these were doctors these are doctor huntstables the families were together it wasn't about um you know strife and angst and then i looked up today and i said wow what's number one black show on tv and at that time it was love and hip hop i think it still is very short amount of time and we've gone from the winslows to love and hip-hop right so you have to realize that at this moment in time the media is definitely creating a simulation and deciding upon what direction they want black americans to go into you see this with the grammys you see this um every basically every show that they have awards show that they have the people that are being honored the people that are being celebrated are people that have this divisive vision of what it means to be a black american while at the same time when i started examining and looking at the statistics and while we were being told to focus on race all of the other areas that were completely crippling america were being ignored so if you were looking for racism a great place to start would be maybe at least having a conversation about why it is that 75 percent of black boys in california can't pass a basic reading exam what is happening in our education system uh i became fascinated with the education system and how it was changing and shifting and you guys are all aware of that they're now teaching critical race theory um which is basically insisting that kids focus all day on ideas of oppression on ideas of backwardness and ideas of why they should hate america why they should hate the person next to them because of the color of their skin it's the very definition of racism when you look at somebody in the face and you say i can look at your color and i know everything about you right you are white so you therefore you are privileged you are black and therefore you are oppressed i don't think every black person is oppressed i'm certain malia and sasha obama are not oppressed right i think there's got to be at least a couple of white people that are living uh you know less than less than uh that they're living in a in a poorer manner than they're living and yet we've just decided that this is the narrative and the reason for that is because what the media seeks to do right now is to collectivize our thoughts they don't want us to see ourselves as individuals they don't want us to actually get ahead when you replace hard academics like reading and writing and and the is with things like critical race theory when a kid can tell you um about white privilege but they can't they can't do their math homework you're basically setting up a society in which we're going to mass produce failures and we're going to mass produce angry failures [Applause]", "-DfGv-b4x2o": "i have just had enough out of amy schumer for a while now i mean if there's a picket sign anywhere amy schumer picks it up she

have the experience that would have made sense but instead they were saying that he was a sexist and that he was a racist and I thought that that was really extreme rhetoric especially because I grew up in a household where I listened to a ton of hip-hop music and particularly in the black community Trump was glorified he was a symbol of status and then the second he decided to become the United States they all changed their mind decided that he was racist and that didn't seem very practical or true to me I had started wondering then is it possible that racism is now being used as a theme to

why don't you start off and just tell me i guess what your viewpoint is on the direction that black culture and culture in general i think would be fair to say is treading right now in america well i think uh cultures you know people are so soft these days i mean this weak soft crybabies men don't want to be men anymore um it's and it's across the board and you know you can see that with people who lack personal responsibility you know i was raised that everything that happened to you has everything to do with your attitude and the way you you know handle adversity it's not somebody else's fault you can't blame the white man you can't blame your cousin them you can't blame none of these people you got to look in the mirror at that person that you see every day and say do i want to win the day or do i want to lose do i want to keep selling drugs or do i want to put the drugs down and actually live a life of freedom you know do i want to be married do i want to you know keep sleeping with women i'm not married you know putting myself in a position to have children out of wedlock those are decisions that you make as an individual and i feel like people want to pass the bucket to everybody else instead of looking in the mirror start looking in the mirror start being the best version of yourself and i think that that will change culture for the better i want to add to that because i actually had done an event the other night and um what you're talking about is a generational change the mindset has changed from one generation to the next and i you guys know my grandfather is my i'm i'm he's my biggest fan and i'm his biggest fan and he really is my idol um and it's so interesting to me to to have lived you know been raised by a man who lived through real racism when i say real racism i'm talking about real systemic oppression jim crow laws right a grandfather who grew up in a segregated south and to speak to him on a daily basis and to have him never complain about anything right then you find your average american today and they never stop complaining about anything right it's it's a non-stop complaining and so you look at the generation you say just a couple of generations ago the average age of d-day when when they landed those ships um in in france the average age of a soldier that fought it was an absolute slaughter fest obviously you know that omaha beach we got the bad beach it was just bad luck you know we went with the canadians the britons americas americans got omaha beach the average age as they were crossing the english channel they were crying saying that they wanted their mother was 22 years old 22 years old your average 22 year old today if i find i don't care what race you are right if i find a 22 year old today the average one on a college campus is crying because ben shapiro's coming to speak and i just can't deal with it it's pathetic yeah you know i was i was just at clemson uh speaking and they went they had all these people out there protesting and saying that our presence on the campus was oppressive to them and that it's somehow i don't know if it's hurting their grades or whatever because we're i i just don't i don't understand and and another thing with culture nowadays is people are so uninformed i mean they make such emotional decisions about everything you know they read a headline and that's what they go they'll die on that hill uh one perfect example and and i'm detouring just a little bit one perfect example is the the young guy that got killed the 13 year old boy adam toledo got killed by a police officer and if you look at the news you look at everybody's outrage they want to protest they got t-shirts already printed out and they're going this guy didn't have a gun the cops just murdered him in cold blood we need justice we need to demilitarize police and it's like you guys are completely missing the point you're completely wrong the kid had a gun it was unfortunate but he had a gun the biggest question that we should be talking about if people want to hold themselves accountable is why does a 13 year old have a gun at 2 a.m shooting the gun off in the intersection and running from police and and i'll add this other one in with the with uh dante wright okay you know i wish that people would not resist the rest i mean it's kind of it's just simple like i get pulled out by a cop because i'm wrong whether i'm wrong or not i'm not going to resist and i would live nine times out of ten for sure but the question is to me is that why is a 20 year old man on social media waving around a gun smoking a blunt with hennessy in his hand with a warrant for his arrest for robbing a woman choking and robbing a woman at gunpoint and not showing up to court driving on a suspended registration what what culture what what type of young men are we creating that this young man is doing all these things at the age of 20 and he had a young daughter that is that to me is more baffling then the police interaction because all of these things that has happened in his life all of the choices that his parents made and that he made got him in a position for a police officer to make a mistake now don't get me wrong she should never be a police officer again in my personal opinion there's no way you should confuse the ta now there's a psychological reason why you could but there's no legitimate reason why you should confuse the two but all of these things led this young man to the position that he was in we see the same thing with george floyd we see the same thing with all of these people that are getting killed by police it's decisions that they're making and not holding themselves accountable and i think one of the things to ask ourselves is why we're not allowed to ask why right so you you have a situation that happens and everybody wants you to react emotionally and in an ideal scenario they want you to go out and they want you to write and they want you to loot and for whatever reason they want you to steal a tv from target because right now i feel like that's a thing right i feel like now actually people aren't even upset and they're just going yay it's still a tv from target night and we can run in and we can steal a tv but what i have found interesting is that these are really important questions why these people have guns why why did george floyd you're saying you're doing this because black lives matter but you refuse to discuss the fact that this individual george floyd aside from being a drug addict let's not forget when i first did that video everyone swore he was saint george they were saying that he had just gotten his life back together all of these lies were making their way around the world and i just asked a simple question i just googled his record right and i said if you're talking about preserving last you know black lives or helping black lives this man spent his entire life traumatizing black people he was arrested for armed robbery several times he spent nine stints in prison he was moving drugs so you're moving drugs into the black community you're getting arrested you know for armed robbery you put a gun to a a a black or hispanic woman you know a minority woman's stomach while her two-year-old was in the room her toddler was in the room you've traumatized black people your entire life and you want me to go out and riot in lieu on your behalf when on a day that you were ingesting drugs you were high on fentanyl isn't this just called like you know you know a cycle of crazy you want me to go risk being arrested so you have a bunch of people who don't have records who are told that they're supposed to be emotional they're supposed to go out they're supposed to riot they're supposed to loot in turn what is the circumstance you have one black person you know who died that day and it's what seems to be clear to me from his medical records is of a drug overdose whether or not let's not even discuss derek shobin just purely one person one black life and you are willing to kill how many black lives for that right we're heart we're hurting the black community and yet when two people get on stage and want to talk about that we're told we're the uncle toms where the coons because we are not falling for what seems to me to be a more nefarious media message which is that black people are only worth anything if they're outside and they're angry and they're rioting and they're destroying their own communities amen one of the issues that i see is that i feel like that many people you know including uh americans of african descent is what i like to call black people in this country like losing the connection with god is where i see the biggest problems there we're not connecting with god like we used to big mama used to have a big old bible that she carried around all the time and you get in trouble she'll probably pop you in the head with it in the name of jesus power so you know but we grew up in you know believing in god and grandma used to always say you're going to go to jail or hell if you keep going down that path selling them drugs and don't get your lesson grandma you say lessons you don't say go to school you can get your lesson i'm like give my lesson but but but that's that used to be valuable to us going to church being a man of god teaching young people how to be leaders and servants serving in the church and different things like that i mean even if you're not a christian you can understand service i learned a long time ago and the reason why i love this country so much is when i started serving with my life when i became a police officer and i had to put my life on the line and i said you know what i'm i'm i'm willing to die for for people that i do not even know that made me more patriotic that made me feel like i have value and and the problem is that without god and without serving others our young people don't feel like they have value and they gain value from gangs listening to cardi b twerking and doing all this other crazy stuff and they see the value there and that doesn't get you far in life that's not going to make you successful that's not going to put you in a position where you really want to be", "5V51dOyRCX8": "then this is why they want you to focus on this when you're in school look at what

we were outpacing them there were businesses because our families were together there was the divorce race isn't what it was people were married our families were together we had jobs we were starting businesses my grandfather did better than my father did okay my grandfather grew up in a segregated south how did he do that because there there wasn't all of this crazy nonsense he never took welfare

that started so small um is now even bigger and beyond my my biggest dreams um because i've realized that what i thought was just the intentional targeting of the black community was really something that began as an experiment in the black community and all of the issues that the black community has been facing since you know the 1960s is now being proliferated and these are now these are american issues it's not black or white if you are american you're in this country you are facing a government that wants absolute control over you and your household and that's the truth so uh i just want to begin by telling you guys about just that right how the government did this and why blexit was started was me recognizing and waking up one day and realizing that my entire life was a lie i went through the public school system talking about that demonic education and it was less obvious coming up in the 90s that i was being brainwashed i came out of the public school system and at 18 years old i knew a few things were definitely true i knew that republicans were racist that anybody that lived in the south was racist anybody that said y'all are hunky-tonked they were racist they wanted to send the worlds backwards right and i knew that if i wanted to be a productive member of society i had to align with the left the left progressive it even sounds better right liberalism sounds so much better than conservatism um i knew that uh women were suffering under men and the patriarchy and then in order to be a woman that was appreciated in this society i had to sort of throw off your clothes right put put your breasts on the internet if you want to really feel what freedom is like and the only reason they're telling you to put your clothes on is because they're trying to make you conservative and men are trying to restrict you i knew a lot of things it's just that i it turns out none of them were true um and it took me kind of growing up in this society in this in this far left bubble of the school system existing under the department of education to make myself very miserable and i didn't realize i was miserable because i was being told that these things would make me would render me more free when you hear that mother talking about why why are all your children saying they're non-binary and all this it's because i'm sure that they are learning in the same capacity that i learned when i was in school that these isms make you more free that it gives you an identity right this is who you can be in the world it feels safe you are somehow a better person even though on the inside you're suffering you're suffering from maybe it's depression you're suffering from the realization that you don't know what you are in this entire world fortunately for me because i was raised by my grandfather always in the back of my mind and that's why i so do believe in the seeds of christianity and the seeds of conservatism in our youth because it's so much easier to go back once you've been exposed to it um fortunately for me i had a grand dad uh that was no nonsense and who i talk about on every stage and if you've ever heard a canister in speech you know that i mentioned my grandad because he saved my life before i even knew my life needed saving um and that is so true of that entire generation we know uh you know the the world war ii generation and the way that they did things the value of work ethic right um the belief that what it meant to be a man was to work with your hands and to provide for your family these are the ideas that we should all be fighting to conserve fortunately for me i had a grandfather who grew up in times of real racial strife there's no question that there was real racism systemic racism that existed in this country at some point it makes me laugh so hard that they have perpetuated a lie that candace owen says racism doesn't exist nope of course racism did exist racism does exist and if you're paying attention racism will always exist because human beings are human beings there's always going to be a japanese person who hates chinese people a white person who hates a black person a black person who hates white people human beings have a component of hate that we are never going to be able to officially conquer there's no system that's going to make everybody love everybody that's part of the lie that the left sells you that if you just keep giving them more money and you keep uh aligning yourself with their ideals that they're gonna turn this this world uh into the magic kingdom actually i shouldn't say that disney's creepy now that's probably exactly what they want the world to be the magic kingdom we're out of we're not doing that anymore um but you know so this this idea of race this of racism of course racism actually existed systematically no more but it did when my grandfather was growing up and he grew up on a sharecropping farm and he uh faced the real ku klux klan like not the imagined clan that cnn comes up with every other week the real clan right he was one of 12 brothers and sisters his uh first job was given him when he was five years old he didn't go to school he went to lay tobacco out to dry in the carolina heat to beat the heat he would raise he would he would wake up at about four o'clock in the morning 4 30 um so that it was before the sun came up at five years old it's incredible for me to think about what my grandfather lived through what his day-to-day was right and i always tell people when i'm speaking to them just put yourself in your granddaddy's shoes because what the world was back then um and there seemed to be so many less problems and screaming and yelling compared to what the world is now and how to make you understand how unbelievably privileged we all are if you are sitting in this room and you are breathing in america you are a privileged person perspective is so needed right and so hearing these stories hearing my grandfather talk about what it was like living under segregation uh i say with children the majority of what they learn is caught right by their parents it's not taught it's caught you're observing them you're seeing how they function i got to see my granddaddy in the house with my grandmother and they were just just good people married from the time they were 17 years old he was married to my grandmother until her dying day my grandfather just passed last year so i saw a functional relationship in a household that was filled with christianity a household that was filled with love and a household where my grandfather very much believed in rules and regulations and believed that if you wanted to be free you had to understand that freedom only comes from personal responsibility let me explain to you what i am talking about personal responsibility i just had a conversation with larry elder and we were talking about this and i wrote about this in my book which i know you all own and you all read twice absolutely but a lot of the reason when you look up and you see that people on the left you think yourself what are they outside screaming about why are they like constantly upset right it's like the loudest longest toddler march for the last five years right it reminds me my son he's 15 months and that's you know he's he's a bit he literally actually sometimes walks around like this a little protester and i just think how could you be a functioning adult in a society and do this all where is your do you ever go to work do you have any responsibilities and the answer is no because they're shirking responsibilities the hardest thing in the entire world is to be personally responsible and yet it's the very definition of freedom if i look at you in the face and i say you are free 100 you are free first you're like yay that's amazing i'm free imagine that imagine that day that day when when the civil rights bill passed and suddenly inked lbj inks it in civil rights movement oh you are free in society you can do whatever you want imagine the first day after slavery you are free go do whatever you want yay and then suddenly whoa whoa i'm free right i can just go do whatever i want now i i ha i have to go figure out what it is that i want to do right i have to go figure out what it is how i'm going to provide for my family i i have to go figure out who i am in this world freedom it feels the word feels nice but it's hard it is hard it means you have to make something of yourself", "WIyEx9ZR8TU": "you are being used abused and lied to and manipulated

when they get together they turn into little boys i mean my husband and like building himself a man cave and then hearing the construction workers talk to him oh we could put a humidor would be so cool could be like batman um so there are aspects of a guy which are very sweet they're kind of always boys but i i find that guys kind of ripen around 28 29 like in their mid-20s so if you're younger than that um you're probably not i mean there's always exceptions but as a rule younger guys are a little bit more immature than women and we actually tend to mature a lot quicker they do eventually

welcome to the stage author and radio host larry elder [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you oh my goodness i can feel the love nobody took a knee thank you all for coming out i can just feel all the energy all the enthusiasm they told me i have no more than 20 minutes to speak so i'll speak quickly i get paid by the word so i'm from l.a i arrive in the charlotte airport to come here to greenville and when i'm in charlotte black guy in the airport walks down he's got a t-shirt on that says i can't be calm i have a black child that's exactly what i said i said what i can't be calm i have a black child obviously what he's referring to uh is this narrative that the police are out mowing down black people just because they're black it's fascinating to me i am a big sports fan and one of my favorite sports teams of all time is so-called fab five you might remember them they were five freshmen they started michigan they made back-to-back final fours one of the fab five is a guy named jalen rose jane rose had a long career 13 years or so in the nba good career became a sportscaster and he's woke he's one of these guys that believes in this narrative now i once heard somebody tell jalen rose that they felt he had a mediocre career that he came out of university of michigan a lot of fanfare 13-year careers a long time in the nba the average career three years but he did not achieve the same numbers that some people thought he should achieve and he said very calmly you see that's the kind of comment that we made that would be made by somebody who's never played basketball at the highest level because if you knew this i played for three teams he said i played for denver and when i was in denver who set the record for assists for a rookie in denver then i got traded to indiana i had a different position top ten my position that guy traded to chicago who in the year i was at chicago in the top 10 with 20 points six dimes five boards me holler at your boy he said and my point is he very carefully skillfully logically with facts with data outlined what he thought was a very successful career and he's right the same mind when it comes to this oh why is this keep happening oh why are they doing this oh doc rivers the coach of the l.a clippers why do these things came happening why do we love america america doesn't love us back i saw doc river speak at our country club in la once logical structured facts data when it comes to his profession if you apply the same mentality to this issue you say to yourself well 50 million police civilian interactions every year out of those 50 million police interactions every year there are 11 million arrests out of those 11 million arrests 60 000 officers are assaulted after the 50 million interactions 11 million arrests 60 000 assaults 1 000 people out of a population of 350 million people are killed every year by the police of that 1000 almost all of them were resisting with the weapon or resisting violently when you get down to the handful of white cops who killed an unarmed black person and by the way unarmed does not mean not dangerous michael brown was unarmed his dna was found on the officer's gun so if you are looking at the percentage of white cops who killed unarmed black men who are not reasonably perceived as a threat you're talking about less than four percent of all the people the police shoot every year 500 of them are white 250 of them are black the police kill at least as many unarmed whites as they do unarmed blacks name one because nobody cares van jones doesn't care cnn doesn't care msnb hee-haw doesn't care they only care when it's a white cop killing a black person now if these guys spent a fraction of the time analyzing this issue the way they analyze their own careers they would realize the narrative is bs now just having a bs narrative and neither here in or there if it doesn't have any downsides this has huge downsides first side the cop side you're a cop why in the world would you be proactive why in the world would you try and stop crime why in the world would you do anything other than answer 9-1-1 squad cars why what's the upside you're going to be accused of engaging in police brutality institutional racism so screw it cops pull back they become more passive it's known as the ferguson effect and what happens crime goes up and who's hurt the very black and brown people that the so-called black lives matter proponents and their sympathizers claim they care about what's the other thing that happens if you're a young black man and you've been told all your life they are out to get me jesse jackson's told me that farrakhan's told me that sharpness told me that van jones had told me that don lemons told me that well if i get pulled over why wouldn't i be wary why wouldn't i think this guy's going to do something to me why wouldn't i be ready to have a confrontation so you have affected both sides with this lie and it is a lie the youngest tenured professor in the history of harvard is a black guy named roland fryer he just knew that the police were using deadly force against blacks just because they were black and was kind of surprised that no one had ever done a comprehensive study about it so he decided he would do it he knew it was going to confirm it he looked at his results and looked at his results and looked at his results and he said this is the most surprising finding of my career not only did he find the cops were not shooting blacks just because they were black he found out the cops were more hesitant more reluctant to pull the trigger on a black suspect than on a white suspect it's a lie it is not true in the last 50 60 years according to the cdc the rate at which blacks have been shot by the police has declined 75 percent meanwhile 15 000 homicides every year in this country half of them are black victims and they ain't being shot by confederate generals they're not being killed by the aryan brothers they're not being killed by the kkk they're being killed by other black people in the neighborhood [Music] chicago labor day leaking what are we talking about 50 000 50 people killed shot five killed the weekend before that 66 people shot five killed the weekend before that 55 people shot 10 killed where's black lives matter where are these people black kid kills another black kid just a dead fly white cop kills a black kid international news you're being manipulated you're being used you're being played and the media does it for one reason one reason only ratings and clicks the democrats do it because they want black people to vote for them and they want white sympathizers to vote for them and the idea is to get 95 of black people voting for the democratic party think about that why would 95 of black people vote for the democratic party if it weren't for the perception that america is racist and we democrats wear the white hat in that fight and those guys over there they wear the black hat that's their theme because if you take away that let's look at abortion 25 of the abortions are on black women black people are more anti-abortion than whites are look at the stats uh same same-sex marriage black people are more opposed to same-sex marriage than whites however you feel about it you're talking about education i went to a high school called crenshaw high school if you saw the movie boys in the hood that was my high school ice tea went to my high school ten years after i did and chose it because it's a crypt school meaning the the gang crips control it and in a recent article in the la times three percent of kids from my former high school can do math at grade level now what parent within a geographical area of that school sends his or her kid who just graduated from middle school to a school where only three percent can do math and it's a school the democrats are mandating that your child go there whether you like it or not republicans want to give you an option out of an underperforming government school and they're the bad guys baltimore where freddie gray died the time he died he died in police custody the mayor is black the police department chief is black the number two guy and the police department is black the state attorney who brought the charges against six officers black three of the six officers black the judge before whom two of the cases were tried black city council all democrat mostly black at the time the u.s attorney general was black loretta lynch and the u.s president with

say after obama got elected how are you going to complain about the man when you are the man knock it off you're getting people killed meanwhile 13 high schools in baltimore where zero percent are math proficient and another half a dozen where one percent is that's half the high schools in baltimore were either zero percent or math proficient or one percent is and we're talking about police brutality are you kidding me you're being manipulated i don't know anybody who had a harder hand dealt than my father my father was born in athens georgia his irresponsible mother threw him out of the house when he was 13 years old because he was quarreling with his mother's then boyfriend my father leaves picks up anything he can do ultimately he became a pullman porter on the trains in those days they were the largest private employer of blacks in those days and my dad came out to california once and it was sunny and you could walk into a restaurant and sit down and be served he couldn't believe it so he made a mental note that maybe someday he relocated to california pearl harbor my dad joined the marines right semper fi bro and i said dad why and my dad said two reasons you know what they are they go where the action is and i love those uniforms my dad is stationed on the island of guam bombs fall war is over goes back to chattanooga where he met married my mom my dad was in charge of cooking facilities in the military he was a staff sergeant my dad can look at a cake and tell you what's in it that's how good he is he wants a job as a short order cook 1945 he goes to restaurant after restaurant after restaurant in chattanooga where he met and married my mom and they said we don't hire my dad goes to an unemployment office the lady says you went to the wrong door my dad goes out to the hall sees colored only goes to that door to the same lady who sent him out my dad went home to my mom and said this is bs i'm going to california i'm going to get me a job as a short order cook i'll send for you after i get a job my dad comes out to la where i live now walks around restaurant to restaurant to restaurant i'm sorry we only hire people with references my dad said i need a reference to make eggs he even offered to work for free for two weeks and then write me a reference nobody would do that he was treated the same way in la as he was in chattanooga they were just a little more polite about it he went to an unemployment office only one door and he sat there and the lady finally calls him up after a day and a half and says i have something i don't know whether or not you want it my dad said of course i'm going to want it it's a job at nabisco brand bred cleaning toilets my dad did that for 10 years he worked for another bread company at the same time full-time job cleaning toilets for that bread company as well he went to night school two or three nights a week to get his ged because he got kicked out of the house and he never went back to school at the eighth eighth grade and he cooked for a family on the weekend the man never slept which is why he was so grouchy all the time and why i had such a difficult relationship with him and my dad told my brothers and me the following hard work wins you get out of life what you put into it and he said larry you are not in control of the outcome but you are 100 in control of the effort [Applause] and before you moan and whine about what somebody did to you or said to you go to the nearest mirror look at it and say what could i have done to change the outcome and finally he said no matter how hard you work no matter how good you are bad crap will happen how you address that bad crap will tell your mother and me if we raised a man by the way i wrote a book about all of this is called dear father dear son two lives eight hours about the eight hour conversation my dad and i had because i hated his guts when i was growing up i didn't realize his background i mean i knew he didn't have relatives because we never got any gifts from him but i had no idea what his life was like and he sat down and told me about everything he'd gone through and at the end of this eight hour conversation this man was bigger and bigger and bigger and larry was smaller and smaller and smaller and my dad was a lifelong republican and he always said this democrats want to give you something for nothing and when you try and get something for nothing you almost always end up getting nothing for something god bless you all god bless our great country we're going to win in november 3rd he's

have this idea now in the age of technology that we're not allowed to grow up there was a time in my life where I thought Barbies were the coolest thing in the entire world if I had a Twitter back then when I was four I would have been like Barbara was the best thing ever now that we've gotten this habit of saying well this is what you thought 20 years ago so this is what like you're supposed to think forever that's not how Evolution Works human beings need to be able to evolve you know you may say I've evolved since then but we have to stop apologizing", "IMNf83c0pdQ": "the governments were the ones that created the problems for Black America right the demo the Democrats the left they enslaved Black America they voted for the Jim Crow law as they voted and they fought to keep the Jim Crow laws still the longest filibuster that's ever happened in Senate was to make sure that black Americans did not get a piece of the of the American dream right and then so they created all the problems and then they said actually changed our mind overnight now we're the solution covid-19 is the same storyline they created every single problem that you have there's a virus guys we don't know where the origins of the virus are per se looks like we've got a lot of money we may have funded some programs but that's a conspiracy theory fact Checkers take that off the internet no we don't know it magically came somebody in China ate some bat soup I think all right don't pay it doesn't matter the virus is here stay at home save lives right oh we're gonna have to we're gonna have to just shut down the world you can't go to work you can't do this we're only going to let you go to the grocery store fear fear fear fear fear campaign and then of course people didn't have money and the government said it's fine here we are again at your door and we're here to help we're here to help you guys we're going to give you 300 checks by the way why go back to work the government we will pay you to stay home because we care so much about you that we will pay you to stay home well how did that work out for black Americans when we were incentivized to do bad things incentivized to have bad behavior right incentivized not to ever aspire to get a better job because we're on welfare right we're on welfare what's the point in order to stay on welfare you can't make this you can't make this much money you got to stay at this threshold or else you're going to lose your welfare benefits well wake up America the same exact thing has happened the same exact thing has happened okay well okay you don't have a job we're going to give you money it's not a lot of money it's not a lot of money but it'll help you in a short run and then you look up and you've got actually people who didn't realize what was happening who didn't want to go back to work right you have individuals in America who did not want to go back to work because the government was paying them and who suffered for that of course the mom and dad shops little coffee shops that hung on by a thread right now they can't find workers now you see the signs everywhere help needed help needed well that's the point it's to take out all of these smaller businesses it's to make it so that every person in America is dependent in some form upon the government that is what has happened in this country before and that is what is happening now so it's why I say if Black America was the tester in realizing how much success they could Garner and how much power over people now they're doing it mainstream now it's for every person no matter what color you are in this country this is what they want they want the corporates to have power the people at the top to have power and the rest of us to be their slaves I got mocked I get mocked Often by the leftist media but um this piece uh always stuck with me they started making fun of me and actually they were quite angry about my language when I said that in many ways what we're seeing today is a plantation and there was a black writer and I believe it was for the Washington Post and he said how dare she use slave rhetoric to describe what's happening in America today how dare she popularized the term uh plantations and talking about what's happening today and the individual took it as hyperbole as if I was trying to either be funny or dramatic or to exaggerate the point but when I said that we have re-entered a time of slavery when I say that we are once again seeing plantations in the mayor in America I meant it sincerely I meant it in terms of what is just really an updated modern modernized uh Plantation today and people don't realize it which is perfect by the way the best kinds of slaves the ones that don't know their slaves right those are the best kinds of slaves people that get up every day and don't recognize that they're slaves and in that regard it's crucial to understand history right how were they able to man to maintain plantations for so long in this country right well you know the first element of it was the breakdown of the family if you're going to be trading human beings like they're Commodities then you need to make sure that they're comfortable um and and leaving their mom and their dad and that they have no sense of what it means to be a family that they're that there's no sense of that familial relations happening between two people in fact in Booker T Washington's Up From Slavery he spoke about this and said he felt nothing when his when his mother and his uh sister were traded because he didn't have a feeling uh for family right so you have to break down the family the second thing that you have to do is to make sure that slaves can't read the slave codes that existed in the beginning of his country ensured that slaves were not allowed to learn how to read and this was so crucial to maintain the plantations that even if you were a white person and you were caught teaching a Slave how to read you could have been punished they said there's no these slaves are not allowed to learn how to read and the reason for that is is simple because an educated mind can't be enslaved God forbid the slaves were reading the the Abolitionist papers that were coming down from the north God forbid the slaves were reading and comprehending that they had self-worth that they were human beings God forbid they believed in in a God right you needed them to act like cogs you did not need them to think like human beings so they need to make sure that the education system was non-existent will look around us today the Department of Education federalized right how the governments are controlling the schools and what do we have to show for it have you looked at the rates and inner cities of how many kids can read across five schools in Baltimore they couldn't find a single child that was proficient in reading and writing the numbers are staggering right the kids since the Department of Education has taken place have gotten dumber and dumber and dumber and this is where you arrive at critical race Theory is where you arrive at what's happening in the school systems and you think to yourself now why on Earth would they be teaching kids about you know to hate one another because that's what it comes down to right you are always a victim and you are always an oppressor this is how it will always be depending on your skin color doesn't matter why keep kids focused on that well the answer is obvious and the answer is clear it is because they want to make sure that these people are like toddlers that they react emotionally that they react like barbarians that they actually have no knowledge it's a beautiful waste of time critical race Theory right they're not going to know math they're not going to know science you're not going to know any engineering they're not going to know anything that could help them get away and be productive in society you want these kids to graduate with meaningless degrees like you know in LGBT studies degrees like in transgender studies you can now get a degree at universities and transgender studies you can get a degree on on on equity and all of these absurd things and I don't know about you guys but never in my life had I needed to call a gender Studies major where I needed something fixed in my house under What scenario do you need somebody with a gender studies degree to do anything you make these kids take out hundreds of thousands of dollars of loans to get a shiny degree in something that will never help them be successful and you have created a perfect slave that has gone through the system controlled by the federal government convinced that they know something when they know absolutely nothing in fact they know such nothing they don't even know who to be mad at right and so they accept the Dogma that's provided to them be mad at the rich man the white man the tall man the man men are the problem the patriarchy just be mad and scream like a toddler into the abyss don't realize that actually you've been cheated from the very second that you stepped foot in the public education system a very very carefully crafted uh Institution for slaves don't be angry at that go out boycott in the name of social justice there is so much to learn for every single American in the world when it comes to looking at the history of Black America because the history of Black America is the American present", "3JlZiOB6Iv0": "imagine a society where we have to allow the thoughts and and add meaning to the thoughts and the reality behind what three-year-olds think this is what the left is after right and then you say what do these things have in common attacked men attack women attack gender attack all of these things and the one thing that's in the middle is family right because when you're encouraging children to change their genders and to go through sex change surgeries right the decision that they cannot reverse later in life what you are basically saying as these kids will not be able to have offspring right all of these things are related to the breakdown of family they want the family unit gone because that is the thing that has made western civilization the strongest the nuclear family unit is under attack in this country right now", "pWvfv-rIRJM": "our strength and our values are

bathroom signs and whether or not they're accepting enough in times of real strife um everybody becomes a conservative because conservative is about sensibility it is the only way that we are going to move forward as a country if we all come together and we we adapt and we realize that conservatism is what built this country if we realize that every single person in this room is connected based on the fact that you were born and you are here in america the greatest country in the world because what unites america is a philosophy that if you work hard and you stay out of trouble and you make good decisions this country will reward you it is that simple", "aCTUkSO60LE": "white guilt is a form of systemic oppression when you talk about the fact that it's in the Academia when you talk about the fact that it's in the media and and sort of suppressing the truth suppressing the facts because it goes against this Narrative of white man bad black people victims right right that's a form of systemic oppression because what what happens is inevitably is that it harms black communities it harms black people first and foremost and what you have when you replace um hard academics people learning about data sets people learning about engineering people learning about scientists instead of replacing those courses with with these soft courses like you know feminism 101 right where you're just learning about how to hate men or African-American studies which is not about the history of black people it's about how to hate black how to hate white people right that's what we're sort of seeing this is this is sort of the turn that academics has taken all together and and you're creating these people that become social justice Warriors and it's all based on feeling none of it is

can have conservative principles it liberates minds on both sides of the aisle and ultimately the goal is to get people to move towards a more productive conversation to actually fix the issues that we do have because the issues that we have in america as i said before are not racism it's not sexism it's not misogyny i think it's we have entire groups of minorities that are suffering from a tremendous sense of low self-confidence and and not realizing that they can have a piece of the american dream if they start to believe in themselves what i'm selling every single day is self-confidence", "SFDOh3jSgPo": "what we encourage is for Black Americans to stop falling for this liberal narrative to stop falling from this idea that you're a victim in this Society because of the

this sort of cultural training that happens first and foremost in the education system we're taught we are literally taught from the time that we get into school that we're victims right that's a plague upon the black Minds a plague upon any mind if you just say to someone you're never going to be able to get ahead you're actually forming an attitude into perspective that makes it impossible to get ahead I see everything as a slight right as a black American I walk outside and someone cuts me off as any other individual you go storm what happens people are not great all the time it's black American I go it's because I'm black because I can't get ahead why do I even go outside and instead we're saying no you're not a victim we're or we are all victims right we are victims of our own decision making", "fA3xJmf6Z3k": "all right ladies gentlemen most people believe the myth that you need to have a grill at home to make a delicious steak like this not true right jeremy absolutely not you can make a steak that's better than restaurant quality for a lot cheaper at your own kitchen i'm telling you guys you're not gonna want to miss this it's me it's mad scientist bbq watch [Music] all right ladies and gentlemen welcome back to cooking with pregnant candice today i am with jeremy yoder of mad scientist bbq and he's going to show us how to make a restaurant quality steak at home tell me about this piece of meat we're at the butcher you're looking at different different cuts the wagyu just tell me everything you know these are filets so you might see it labeled filet mignon people usually just call them fillets but it's a group of mussels on the cow that are seldom used they don't get a lot of work which means they're very tender so mussels get used a lot like a brisket this from the chest of a cow gets used all the time which means it's super super tough unless you cook it for a long long time fillets are the exact opposite these you want to sear hard cook them quickly so they remain tender my favorite way to make steaks is actually with cast iron or carbon steel but we're cooking on an induction stove today so we have the stainless steel pan and it's nice and thick so we should still be able to make great quality steak so what do you think the first thing we're going to do is i think we're going to put salt and pepper on it you're very i'm so right usually the higher up you go the more evenly you'll coat the steak that's not super important because this is all going to dissolve and it's going to start penetrating into the meat what that does is it holds moisture inside the meat because you can think of salt as something that holds onto water molecules okay right that's the simple way to think of it and so if we get salt penetrating into the meat it's going to hold onto water inside the meat and keep it from drying out also that seasoning that is the salt that penetrates the meat is going to give it more flavor we ideally would do this an hour before so that salt has time to penetrate into the meat further but because the cook is relatively short it's not going to go all the way so sometimes it might be necessary on a steak this thick that little finishing salt at the end that's a really easy thing to fix okay when you put your hand above the pan there it should start to feel really hot and then a lot of times with just tiny bits of residue that you find on the pan you'll see little whisk of smoke then you know this thing is hot it's ready to go ready to roll there we go i'm going to do a spoonful of towel just one spoonful one spoonful which you can make at home by putting fat from all your meats let's turn this induction stove a little bit down it's actually really hot that's good extremely hot which is good because when you take this cold piece of meat and put it on that pan it's going to start sucking up the heat from the pan so the more mass your pan has the heavier your pan is the more it's going to be able to resist the cooling down so we put this guy in there we don't want it to cool down too much and if you're concerned about it you can kind of place it away from you so any splatters will go away and then the next important thing is press it down because you want that full contact surface to surface so you get browning all the way around because if you just have grill marks where it's browned right you don't have maximum flavor you want maximum flavor want full contact so we have a completely brown edge we're going to get a little smoky here but that's okay that means we're going to be creating flavor on that side all right let's see here starting to get good color so you see a right around the edges you have browning but right in the center it still looks a little gray we don't want gray on the outside so you want the entire thing to have that nice brown finish exactly okay so we're gonna dump it that one yeah press down right in the middle to make sure it makes contact there yeah we're still going to need some more time but we're starting to get that brownie that we want people think you have to cook a steak on a grill because they want the grill marks they want to see how it looks but yeah that's just a psychological operation [Laughter] like alex jones yeah yeah so i got it from top levels of the government the globals are trying to take over that's really good dimensional clockwork hills what what did this come from i didn't know you could do voices who else you could you can do donald trump not really you can't try well it's like look everybody quite frankly i've got the best record you've ever seen the best steak yeah well done with ketchup um i can't really do donald trump and do maybe jesse ventura like you explained to me candace what happened to tower seven but that is what we want you see that bubbling fat that's that's getting rid of water good pick but that bubbling is because it's evaporating water and forming that crust on the outside as a working mother i take advantage of every opportunity to save time and money and if you're following me on instagram you know that i love to cook for my family and so thank goodness for good ranchers i love this brand i love the quality of their meat i love their delivery service not only do they help me save money but more importantly they help me save time their boxes are simple to order and they come straight to your door they make buying meat at the grocery store thing of the past especially because grocery store prices feel like they've absolutely doubled they have good ranches prices however stay low and affordable once you subscribe listen to this your price will never go up your best price is locked in for life does it matter what the inflation is doing doesn't matter pay attention to any of that you are locked in they only source and sell 100 american meat from local farms and ranches their beef is prime and upper choice the two highest possible grades they have signature steak burgers and wagyu burgers that are packed full of flavor they're pre-trimmed and pre-marinated chicken breasts are absolutely delicious take it from me and it's so so so easy to prepare it becomes packaged just so easily they're better than organic meaning that they are completely antibiotic free so be sure to go to go to ranchers.com candace to save on the quality that you've been looking for use my code canis and enjoy your box of 100 american meat and your 30 savings if you don't buy the meat in your house tell the person that does they have to check out good ranchers american meat delivered so right now we're going to want to finish this we're going to add more flavor but we're just going to let it rest okay because the outside of the steak because we're trying to sear it hard is going to be really hot now let's talk about that because the whole resting of meat thing right why do you let meat rust the real reason is you have this thing called carry-over cookie carry-over cooking is that outside surface right now is extremely hot right 200 plus degrees the inside is still cold and so that heat that's on the outside is making its way through so we let it rest so it can kind of gently make its way through because we don't want to nuke the outside and have a good sear but then a huge band of well done meat and then right at the center we have a bullseye of the medium rare that we're looking for got it okay so we're just letting it hang out for a second while we get this ready for the next step yeah okay the next step involves what is your favorite uh fat butter butter 100 extra and it gets a bad rep by the way but it is a good fat butter is a good fat it's a dirty dirty rumor that it's not a good fat yeah it's a conspiracy theory it's a conspiracy theory not to your voice see it's a psychological operation they don't want you to eat butter they're trying to turn everybody into vegans but uh but we want to do a couple things here one is we're going to add garlic garlic and butter go together like salt and pepper fan of garlic there's no such thing as too much garlic i've tried the theory i've never come across a dish where i said hmm that's too much garlic too much garlic in there all right so the easiest way to prep the garlic is put it on the cutting board take the knife oh my gosh that's a life hack right there no no do it again that's gonna change a lot of people's lives on the internet okay there we go brilliant so we're not trying to eat the garlic so it doesn't matter how we treat it at this point really we just want it to infuse that butter with garlic flavor so keeping it simple is going to be your friend here so focus on a couple things get the crust on the outside of the steak get the steak done properly and then all these extra flavors are easy to add and they're all just a bonus because you've got the sear you've got salt and you've got it done properly on the inside you're going to have people liking that steak no matter what yep now what we want to do is start getting this hot again and then it'll infuse that butter and while we're waiting i want to know what the internal temperature of this guy is so i'm going to go on the side here and right now we're at 105. okay so where we want to be doing it this way the way we based it we're going to have to take it off fairly early because of carryover cooking so we probably need to pull it at about if you like medium ish probably about 114 115 and then it will continue to climb another 20 degrees or so wow 20 degrees it will climb one to 12 because we're yeah how long do you let it rest when you when you take it off when i'm finally done about 10 minutes at least 10 minutes so we got garlic do you like rosemary do you like thyme do you like both i like all of it thyme rosemary everything so we don't want those herbs to burn so we put them in last now that that's all bubbling i'm confident that we got garlic flavor infused in there the garlic is starting to brown a little bit and you can smell garlic you can smell rosemary rosemary the smell of rosemary yeah so it's time to baste this thing and basting is going to be you know it's going to be really kind of an intense way to cook it because beautiful from the bottom and then we're going to be spooning hot butter over the top so the process just goes like this you dump the butter in and it's not all that flavor yep it's going to be bubbling now i want to talk about the temperature we're doing with that because we want to be mindful that we're not burning the butter so you're kind of gotten this like a medium temperature i would say yeah okay so if we see the butter start smoking so let's back off yeah we don't want to have too much of that but oh it smells kind of so good pull it this is definitely restaurant quality this is what they're doing back there i always wonder what that is yeah do this for a minute and then you have kind of that buttery goodness that coats the outside one of the restaurant secrets is they'll take a steak they'll slice it and they'll cover it with steak butter which is basically butter and usually parsley or something like that so when are we going to let it rust how do you tell our handy dandy nope thermometer 106. we got a few more degrees all right you want to try your hand it basting oh yeah okay that smells so good let's tilt the pan here yep there we go see the bubbling yeah it's telling me it's hot enough and then i can kind of scoop it in there yep there we go just scoop it on top so it's been cooked from the bottom and the top now which is this restaurant quality steak now as somebody who loves cooking meat with fire i actually cook steaks in a pan almost exclusively yeah it's exceptionally rare that i'll cook one outside i just think you get a better sear and you get a better product by doing it in a pan okay that's 113 115 so i think we're probably done wow so if you would i will do the honors yep there you go there we go restaurant quality steak at home are you going to put some of these in there yeah throw some garlic on there why not okay if they didn't burn you can eat them too but it's going to look pretty we're just going to make it look nice yeah that's what you want you know what that's exactly right people like this at a restaurant anyways you just want it presented like this steak pairs with a lot of things my favorite is to pair it with steak what are you doing with that knife i'm about to cut a steak okay it's cut the steak time best part of dinner time all right oh that is perfect for me so yep wow we're going for medium i think we're all right yeah now that's this is exactly medium yeah so what we wanted was to maximize the crust without getting a huge band of well done right afterward so i think we're pretty good so i think we kind of hit what we were looking for now if you would have been a a better person at heart you would have gone with medium rare you would have pulled it a couple degrees sooner yeah that's that's pretty i'm gonna i'm gonna have to eat some of that now hey remember that uh restaurant trick i told you about the things that they do to make their steaks taste even better they have their you know steak butter with this we can just kind of a little bit over the top brilliant and then that is going to have that infused garlic flavor the infused rosemary infused time all that stuff and we don't go crazy we got a little bit so wow if you want them it's almost too pretty to eat but i bet i can eat it all right i'm going to go with this piece i don't know why all right well what do you think that is a phenomenal piece of steak i mean that's better than restaurant grade thank you this is 100 bed in the restaurant grade and we did it right here in the kitchen i did all the work but you did help you guys you can follow jeremy and mad scientist bbq on socials and be sure to tag us if you make this amazing steak at home i mean just grade a absolutely delicious i'll see you guys next time [Music]", "B9dtU6wG2Pk": "come from a single parent household on government assistance i live in one of the

saying toast amplify the avocado toast we took it to another level we took it to literally another level he makes this for his kids but he now had to make it for me because i'm pregnant and everyone has to make me food when i'm pregnant [Music] i'm so excited because i'm still pregnant and i get to have a second breakfast today possibly a third breakfast i'm with my buddy john rich you guys all know him and we're gonna cook up one of his favorite breakfast dishes i've already kind of warned you i'm very judgmental when i'm pregnant so well prepare to judge because i am an official amateur so this should be interesting but what are you gonna make so you know when you go to like an airport or hotel because i spent a lot of time in those places they always have avocado toast right because it's healthy but most of the time it literally is just avocado on toast and it's the most boring thing ever to eat but i do i do love avocados and i love what that is so i thought you know what i'm gonna hype it up now you gotta remember i'm a texan so i like to throw the heat into it i throw a little flavor into it so i have kind of an amped up version avocado toast with scrambled eggs tostada tostada you know you eat it like you get flat like this so let's make this right do the best the first thing is most people i learned how to you make this for your kids i have to ask that i do but i have two sons who are once 10 one's 12 and you would think they would eat the same thing but they do not eat the same thing so it's always like hey dad don't put that on mine and the other one's like put extra on mine so you know how to get the seed out of an avocado you know why don't you show us you just stick it with a knife turn it oh wow i definitely i was doing the scoop movement bring them out these are good avocados what are these costing nowadays with bad inflation i don't know i have no idea what they're costing with fine inflation but i'm going to go ahead and say eight dollars wow you know what i'm probably not far off i made it up but you know to me this this guacamole that we're making that's that's really what's because scrambled eggs are scrambled eggs you are right that whenever you order this at an airport it's just it's so underwhelming so boring it is it's dry it's disgusting it's like yeah nah we can do better we're gonna elevate it yeah we're gonna there you go elevate it and i do watch chopped a lot so which means you know what you're doing and i'm friends with i'm friends with guy fieri so i'm qualified oh we gotta get him out here is this three avocados do we just do i'm just doing two there's two avocados you and me okay great and then but i'm also pregnant so it's actually not just you and me these are great avocados actually there's three of us here that's right specifically when i'm pregnant i don't know what it is but breakfast is my jam i literally will eat breakfast breakfast lunch and dinner there's no time that i don't want breakfast was it the same way with little man it was it was the exact same way i couldn't miss breakfast with him and i it had to be a big southern feast because i you know i grew up with my granddad right and he was all about the grits the bacon the eggs the bacon the biscuits i should be overweight i am actually at the moment because i'm pregnant i think she looks great right guys sure it's great all right you ready so we're going to fire this up purple onion purple onion preferred i like purple onions a little bit of whatever kind of onion you want some coarse black pepper plenty of plenty of black pepper can't have enough pepper i love spicy by the way people under salt guacamole all the time i'm one of these people i've committed this sin you want enough salt in there little tomatoes grind that up cilantro cilantro is a very interesting article fires it up squeeze a couple of limes in there all right here we go so the lime the lime fires it up but you know what else lime juice

waffles so now we're going to do to our scrambled eggs now scrambled eggs sounds like the easiest thing in the world but how many times have you like burnt your scrambled eggs i never burn them

and i can find something in you go ahead i learned how to crack an egg at 32 years old is that right in a whole damn 32 32 years old one day i decided in the privacy of my home about eight weeks ago

i'm sure you i mean you're a perfectionist candace all right fine i'll do it go ahead if i get 16 shells in there you can take one more egg all right fine but then we're gonna have to pause so people can take the that would i say one yes this is what i do i go like that and i drop it you turn it forward it's very kind you're very kind to the egg it's like a little bow forward it was it was a little uh a little little honor helps the gravity helps for the egg that we're about to eat all right so those are mixed up now what i do in the skillet is uh get those in there did you add us a touch

and it's more critical to assess what we do wrong because it might feel like we're winning it might feel like we're on top but if we're not able to have open dialogue about the things that we can change we can lose that in a moment particularly we saw this a lot during what we now call kanye week the notorious week that kanye west tweeted out i love the way candace owens thinks uh one of the most influential people in the entire world is kanye west um he tweets one thing and within one week black support for donald trump double that's how impactful him putting on the maga hat and saying i like donald trump he's my brother um was to our community and it what he did was he gave black people the permission to pursue different ideas so everyone that follows kanye west and they found my videos and there were a ton of debates obviously some people hated me some people loved me some were screaming boy caught kanye didn't work out uh the point is is that he did something for the conservative movement uh that will be spoken about years from now", "GoFc2BxxND8": "if there's no not one piece of empirical data that supports the claim that police are targeting black men um and yet actually there is empirical data that shows that since black lives matter started it's actually harmed us and and across the country I think there was an 18 increase in death because police officers don't want to do their jobs if they know they're going to be called racist and they get the call to go you know help black people in different circumstances they're not going to want to show up and do their job yeah and and when you talk about things that actually maybe could matter and for example NFL protesting on their knees for police brutality I think I have a higher chance of actually getting beat by an NFL player as a woman than I do I'm being shot that's the truth look at the Staggering race domestic violence in the NFL why don't we take a need for that oh no no no no we don't want to do

almost the most important thing being able to not take yourself so seriously and I feel like the one thing the black community always had was humor like the best comedians the funniest comedians that was our thing exactly we're allowing these these you know the different Cults of leftists exactly strip something that was actually always ours taking away Kevin Hart's uh opportunity to host the Emmys it was Kevin yes I mean stupid so stupid do you realize they're taking away one thing that made us happy and in turn we have to be anger angry about so they say you don't get to be funny anymore

mechanism to get rid of undesirables so if they thought that a certain class of people should not procreate and you can go back and you could read margaret sanger's writings they were considered unfits in society black people they did not want them to procreate and have families so they encouraged them to get abortions and then told them that this was the right decision for them to make it

trendy to me at all men should be men meant to dress like men it's just not my thing but we're kind of getting into a society where like things are getting weird i think they're just trying to be

and all the girls love it they don't they love that they do not know they love him because he's talented he's talented and he sings and it's he's got the rockstar thing going on sure so harry styles

today we are discussing movies and i'm going to give you my top picks a little background though i'm not the biggest movie buff actually i just saw star wars for the first time like three years ago it's very frustrating when everyone's always making a reference to a movie and i'm like ah i actually was kind of more of a book dewey but that's okay i do have favorite picks and i'm going to give you those across every genre okay first up in the category of humor i will not be friends with you if you do not like wedding crashers it is to me a perfect comedy there's not a single person that i would take out of that from the grandma it was absolutely hilarious every person belongs in that film vince vaughn his ad-libbing is perfection lock it up lock it up lock it up and i never get tired of it never i could watch that movie every day and i'm laughing at something that i didn't pick up on because vin spawn is so quick it is just like in order to sit with me you have to like wedding crashers the rules the rules are incredible rule number six do not sit in the corner and sulk it draws attention to you in a negative way draw attention to yourself but on your own terms rule number 76 no excuses play like a champion whoever created this movie whoever wrote this movie i want to be best friends with you that's all i'm saying next up in the category of romantic comedy when harry met sally is an all-time favorite i always watch that movie i call it a new year's movie but my husband pointed out that it's not really a new year's movie but i always watch it around christmas and new year's because obviously the ending that's when it happens when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible oh that is just like you harry you say things like that and you make it impossible for me to hate you billy crystal is so funny in that movie and it's just great i just i love it okay in the category of like a family film never gets old it's hard to pick just one denzel washington movie but remember the titans do you guys remember the titans do you remember remember the titans yeah you should go watch that again it felt like it told the story of america like moving into a different period of race and it's based on a true story which is also amazing you should go watch that again i just made my husband watch it because that one didn't really make its way across the pond everywhere we go people want to know who we are [Music] actually fun fact i actually was a titan middle school turn of river titans so we used to do that just be a cheerleader just do that so yeah remember the titans classic okay disney movie this is a super recent one but if you have not seen it you have to see this movie it's so good cruella emma stone amazing also someone else that i want to be friends with probably not going to ever meet but i love emma stone cruella is amazing i'm not kidding i'm like my husband did not want to watch it i forced him to watch it with me and he even he admitted it was really good you kind of got to get past the first 15 minutes because first you're like is this like gonna be weird and cheesy but then it's just phenomenal so that is probably one of my favorite movies out right now gotta give it to emma stone always what was your name cruella okay this next one i don't really know what category it balls in but it might actually be my favorite movie ever pretty woman i just think julia roberts and pretty woman richard gere is a gear gear i know doesn't matter because that's not his name in the movie phenomenal i mean just from start to finish i love that movie so much and i think for me just that scene when she goes in and she goes back into the store and she's like big mistake huge i love that because i feel like it's the story of my life people always underestimate me and i feel like i've gotten to where i am by just like you know hard work not being a prostitute i should i should probably specify but i love that moment because it's just like being in a room where people underestimate you um and kind of going back and showing in their faces like haha big mistake huge favorite musical hands down is grease born to hand ya baby yeah what's that guy danny zuko what's his name real life john travolta duh amazing he's so good in that movie love him in that movie not in real life but greece i just i grew up watching a lot of musicals i actually should also put the sound of music under there but the reason why i decided grease over the sound of music is because when i was young i didn't know the sound of music was about the holocaust and it kind of made it much more depressing when i got older because i thought it was just about like a happy nanny scene with kids when i was watching it every day when i was young and i was like and now i know actually like it was very sad movie but it ends well the von trapp family escapes but grease hand driving better last but certainly not least this is a classic and i also saw it for the first time about five years ago it doesn't matter it was amazing and that to me is the marker of a great film that it just survives decades the godfather i'm gonna go with part one incredible just an incredible film from start to finish and i did watch the second one which is also good wasn't that impressed with the third one but i just love the whole concept of family not necessarily that you should just kill your brother i'm not saying that fredo deserved to die but you never go against the family um usually it me watching a movie if i didn't grow up on it it ends up with like someone saying oh my god i can't believe you've seen it i can't believe you haven't seen it i can't believe you haven't seen it and then eventually i just throw them in town i'm like okay i'll watch it and sometimes i don't think it's good like i'm sorry to say this a lot of people are going to hate me but star wars i i'm sorry i know it's a culture and then people go oh but it was different then because it was the 70s when the first movie was made but so was the godfather wasn't the godfather of the 70s and the godfather i saw and i thought it was absolutely amazing star wars is a bit more like a fan cult it's like trying to break into spice world i'll pretend i didn't hear that grew up with the spice girls you love the spice girls the music was amazing but you can't just suddenly tell someone the spice girls was amazing and objectively they probably weren't how dare you and people are going to hate me and stop following me because i said that because as i said star wars fandom is real and so for all the fans i'm losing for i said about star wars i'm sorry i don't mean it much to learn you still have um give me some classics never saw it i've seen nothing never saw it [Laughter] legally blonde but that's not like an old classic that's like a no but old ones are like the 80s and like 70s movies that like have survived free willy was good i liked free really great ending killer whale just jumps over him it's beautiful michael jackson comes in and sings oh you know what i should have added to the list for action 300 solid film i absolutely loved gerard butler and 300. this is sparta that's how i feel in politics sometimes like this is america wow it's interesting because it's like kind of a graphic action like it's a bit cartoony but it's really the script and the characters you know it's it's something that when you don't really see that much masculinity and testosterone on display anymore in general um but you know it's an incredible story the peloponnesian wars incredible story you know the merit the whole concept of a marathon kind of came from this um and there's something about them fighting and i don't know what it is it's just like just it's the exhilarating ride to watch 300. absolutely exhilarating all right guys that's it that's a wrap on my favorite movies feel free to comment how much you hate me because of what i've said about star wars and also tell me what your favorite movies are", "wLWLQlfS9Gw": "it is so important for people to understand

magazine a really good interview i recommend you go and read it not that i agreed with a lot all of his ideas i you know i think he was a little more left on me more left than me when it came to the economy without question but they asked him a question uh the the person i was interviewing him and i'm paraphrasing um they talked about the fact that he believed in peace you know he really he he advocated for us to to never be violent um when trying to achieve peace we know that that that's why um we celebrate dr martin luther king because he was considered this vision for peace in america even during a time of such racial unrest and they asked him why uh you know why why don't you believe in the concept of revolution of fighting to get peace and he said because you can't you can't fight if you want to get peace and the interviewer rightfully pushed back on him and they said well you know respectfully dr king you're wrong look at the american revolution the revolutionary war they fought and then they got peace a period of peace that's why we have america today and he said something that was so important he said if the idea is separation then you can fight for peace if you revolt and your end goal is that you want to be separated and on your own then you can fight and have peace but if your end goal is not separation but integration then violence is never the means think about that think about that when you think of these groups that advocate for racial violence that you're gonna up get up in the street and scream and fight if a black man is unarmed and gets shot think about that what are they fighting for do we want a society where black people and white people can't sit together like they are in this room because that's what they're advocating for when they say they want uprisings i think in that regard dr martin luther king was way ahead of his time in understanding that in this country what minorities want and always be conscious of that what we want what we've always wanted is integration because america is the greatest country in the world and i believe [Applause] america has always been the only way to the promised land which i will show you like now [Music] we've got some difficult days ahead but it really doesn't matter with me now because i've been to the mountaintop and i've seen the promised land but i want you to know the night

all the time my ideas are not original they're not i've gotten my ideas from people that have lived before me who have been saying them and screaming them for years and nobody listened the people that we've rejected and called uncle toms and coons right i i thought the exact same thing about black conservatives when i was growing up because i was conditioned to believe that those heroes have been there forever whether it's whether it's dr martin luther king and his speeches whether it's larry elder which what an honor it is for me to share a stage with him whether it's dr thomas soul whether

word intersectional I mean I just I'm done with the leftist vocabulary but we get to the T because that's the most important part right to me right now today this push and I have been outspoken against this and you say why why is the thing like bathroom signs we really need to do that do we need to have a debate about bathroom signs and yes they're offended because this says women and this says men but I'm not women or man I'm intersex I'm this I'm that and then you hear that they're pushing this agenda in the school system telling children they can pick their genders Trevor Noah a few days ago came out and said gender reveal parties should be a thing of the past because your child will tell you what gender they are now about to be a parent not one yet but I can tell you that I did nanny and um the girl was three and she was convinced that she was a mermaid right the left would have it that I should be allowing her to stay in the bath forever because she is a mermaid there's this thing called You're the parents and they are the child right I mean imagine a society where we have to allow the thoughts and and add meaning to the thoughts and the reality behind what three-year-olds think this is what the left is after right and then you say what do these things have in common attacked men attack women attack gender attack all of these things and the one thing that's in the middle is family right because when you're encouraging children to change their genders and to go through sex change surgeries right the decision that they cannot reverse later in life what you are basically saying as these kids will not be able to have Offspring right all of these things are related to the breakdown of family they want the family unit gone because that is the thing

this is about sexual assault this is about rape I said that's the point the left has found something that everybody's uncomfortable challenging right you who would want to challenge a you know a hashtag me to this hap who would want to be the person to say this is wrong right well me because I believe in due process right and I saw this hashtag happening in the me too and I said this is going to be the way the left takes down any man women that they want to in a second because they're now removing due process right how simple it is to remove due process and I talked about this in my book but is there any community that should have been louder against the me too movement than Black America did we not learn the lesson of what happens when allegations go unchecked do we not remember what happened to Emmett Till how dare we allow left to again say no matter what believe women hashtag blanket believe women I mean what an absurd idea you should never hashtag believe women you should never hashtag believemen you should always hashtag belief facts okay belief facts and so they find these vulnerable points and they get more extreme every single time you know they and then people don't realize until it's gone too far everyone's shy to say and then suddenly you look at Brett Kavanaugh and then you go whoa that happened very quickly right now we understand what they're really after and it's the answer is always power it's always power and the covid-19 just came it was just too well packaged the timing for me it's like wow so um we can't come together we can't do this we can't come together we can't see one another you're saying we all have to stay home by ourselves and rely on the mainstream media narrative to know what's going on outside the one thing they have wanted full control of the narrative is exactly what you're handed when people can no longer go out and have experiences this is what you call Plato's allegory of the cave right and and for those of you that don't know that story um Plato wrote a story called The allegory of the cave and it essentially says it's a story about 3 three prisoners who are hung up on a wall and there's a fire behind them their entire lives they're hung they're hung up and they believe that the Shadows on the wall are real that this is reality there can be no different reality and people are putting shapes behind the fire and they have no idea what life is outside of the cave right and suddenly one of them gets freed and they go outside and he burns his eyes and then suddenly he starts to see reality for what it is he sees the trees he sees the sky he sees everything outside he said oh my goodness what I thought was reality wasn't reality but I have to go back and tell them I have to go back and tell the remaining two prisoners of what's really outside I've now had this experience I understand what reality is right and so he goes back inside and he tells the prisoners and his eyes are burning and they and they look at him and they say you're crazy don't touch us we don't want to be cut down that can't possibly be true this is reality in front of us and they mock him and they call him crazy and I say that that allegory which I discussed in my book is so much of what it's like to be a black conservative today right because we've made it out of the cave we know what reality is the people whose hands are still tied up looking at the Shadows on the Cave the Shadows being created by CNN by MSNBC by NBC telling them that this is what you need to fear this is what's real this is what you're going through that is a lie get outside and step into the sunlight right that is the challenge As Americans to encourage people to never allow someone else to control your narrative and I said all the time you know when I first decided that I was going to listen just listen not listen to A A reproduction of what he said but just listen directly to what the president said I was shocked after watching a full speech and then going and listening to what the mainstream media turned it into right how can I ever trust them with any story ever again I have to trust my experiences the mainstream media had created for me a reality that didn't exist about conservatism they lied and this is this is not just the mainstream media the way they've done it has been brilliant and you have to give credit to the left where credit is due it was Machiavellian what they did right first they realized that you have to attack every pillar and every structure that makes sense to people so they attack God right first and foremost you have to remove God you have to remove Faith this is why in the media they routinely mock Christians right they they say there's something wrong with Christianity you're a Jesus freak you're a Bible gun Tau in you know this is this is all wrong right they mock that because then once you remove God then you've got family and they've destroyed family and when they did that to Black America they knew it would happen you see when you remove the family when you remove anything a vacuum exists and something's got to fill that vacuum something's got to fill that hole right and for the black youth it was easy instead instead of getting that maternity and paternity inside the home you have to pursue it somewhere else so you pursue it on the streets", "Rfl0ZvJKGwQ": "hey guys Candace Owens here and I am with Jeremy Yoder he is the mad scientist Barbecue on YouTube you are not going to want to miss us making this pork belly he knows a lot about science I know nothing about science we take shots of apple cider vinegar in the middle for absolutely no reason you're not going to want to miss this you guys stay tuned today I am with Jeremy Yoder I just learned that Yoder is like the Smith of last names for Amish people uh he's a mad scientist BBQ that's your YouTube channel right it is yes and before we get into what we're making today I want to know why you're a mad scientist I got a degree in Biochemistry and then I worked as a school teacher so what I focused on day in and day out was being able to explain science so that kids would understand so I just kind of Applied that same thing to doing barbecue videos on YouTube okay I love that so what do we have here here we have pork belly so pork belly is exactly what you might think it is so if you look at that what is what does that look like steak oh it looks like bacon I was gonna say bacon yeah that was my third guess yeah so this is pork belly so it comes from the belly of the hog and it's really nice because there's lots of fat and so people have said for a long time fat is flavor but in this case fat is going to be juiciness that's the thing we're after Okay so this has lots of fat which is going to be really good for us okay so what are we making today pork belly burn ends pork belly burnt ends burnt ends that sounds delicious yeah so Burnett's usually come from a brisket but we can take a pork belly and kind of treat it the same way so we're going to cube it up and then we're going to season the outside put it in the oven because the more surface that's exposed that's the more opportunity we have to create flavor all right so let's get started you don't sound mad by the way you sound happy oh I am happy anytime I'm cooking meat I'm here I'm giving yourself a bad rep out there okay so all we do is we take these and cut them into cubes so okay really simple something like that and so you get the same kind of feeling as when you're eating bacon or candied bacon in this case because we're going to glaze these in the end but it's got that richness it's got all the stuff that people like about bacon but in a bigger bite so do you want to do some cubes of this yeah I'll do it so you have to tell me a little bit about your uh Amish beginning because I feel like that means that you automatically know how to make everything that was way too thick but I did what you did the first one is too thick next ones they're all going to be perfect perfect I was born into an Amish family and uh if you don't know anything different you don't think it's weird so when I would tell my friends growing up yeah I was born into an Amish family and say wait wait hold on hold on how did you used to be Amish and I was like well I don't know it just was we didn't have a TV we didn't have a car we got a horse and buggy oh that's just I want to be Amish now I think the world's getting crazy it is getting crazy so it's looking like a better and better decision maybe yeah but yeah so my parents left when I was in elementary school and uh you know my grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles are still on there so still have a lot of connection to that okay great as a matter of fact the Amish make this apron that I'm wearing so I love that apron what we're gonna do with these guys is we're just gonna put them in here and because we're not going to put these on a smoker we're just going to use the oven and I know you're a fan of the oven I love the oven I love a very simple Appliance I think it's underrated in the kitchen everyone's all buying these expensive appliances and chocolate I smoked the meat for eight days I'm like well I made mine in the oven I love to make pork a lot of times people will try to accrue more and more equipment because especially for men that's how you you you know evaluate your status golf clubs but if you just know the proper techniques and know the principles behind what you're doing you can make great stuff with almost any equipment all right so the next thing we're going to do is we can't put this on a smoker but we want to get some smoke flavor on those pork belly burn ends so what we're going to do is use Liquid Smoke that's this stuff right here and it's very potent if you want to you want to check it out yeah hold it smell it oh yeah that's nice that's really nice what is this again Liquid Smoke the volatile compounds in smoke that that is stuff that's given off as a gas can get collected by being dissolved in water this is how rain works I pay attention in that science class and so sensation evaporation precipitation I I gotta see on that one two out of three yeah but yeah so Liquid Smoke you just kind of concentrate the smoke flavor into the water and then you can add it to things and give it a smoky taste without ever having to put it on the smoker that's so great this is such a half this is such a kitchen hack I love that yeah so Liquid Smoke is dirt cheap too so we're just gonna dump that in there and you don't need a lot because it's pretty darn potent yes and then the other thing we're going to add is some Worcestershire sauce yeah so we got some of this and the reason we want that is because we want the savoriness to kind of umami they say so it's a process where a bunch of stuff like including anchovies breaks down for a long time okay so you might that's what Umami means Umami means Savory oh gotcha yeah so you have sweet salty bitter in what language Umami I think it's Japanese oh yeah but don't ask me any more Japanese because that's all I know but yeah we're gonna add that because we want really Savory notes on the outside and we want that smoke on the outside so we're just going to mix these guys up so if you want to mix them oh yeah and cover the outside and you don't need a smoker we're still going to have some Smoky meat as a working mother I take advantage of every opportunity to save time and money and if you're

you're trying to get your hands on a little bit of pork belly so the easiest thing to do is look for Heritage breed pork and so typical commodity pork you can kind of think of it as the Bland flavorless cousin to Heritage breed pork the difference is if you look at this pork belly you see the color that meat they say that pork is the white meat right or is I guess the other white bean I should say but if you look at that that looks red like a steak almost that's because there's more myoglobin inside that meat which means it's going to hold more moisture and gonna have more flavor than just typical commodity pork that would be almost the same color as this fat I'm going to turn this on nobody likes an induction stove nobody nobody body nobody we don't actually need the induction stuff oh we don't that's why we're turning it off because nobody likes it okay we're gonna use the oven your favorite favorite Appliance all right so we're gonna put these on here and we're gonna do is just set these down I'm gonna season them with salt and pepper okay yeah you can oldly but a goodie yeah you can make it as complicated as you want some things you might try would be more like salt and pepper you could do your salt and pepper oh you and I were like salt and pepper oh okay no comment s you're really trying to make young company that's all right specialize in yeah so we're gonna put a little salt and a little pepper a little salt and pepper go for it all right you can be pretty generous yeah and then you're doing it wrong you're doing it wrong ready it's like this it has to fall off it's got to fall off the uh the forearm really good I mean you nailed that internet thank you yeah you got to do the internet more my job's already on the internet [Laughter] Okay so you're such a favorite utensils in the kitchen because then like when you have all this extra stuff you know just a little bit we don't need to go crazy but this is a great way to sort of sure jumping in here here the internet thing to say would be layers of flavor layers of flavor so you want to just keep adding a gratuitous amount of stuff you say or should I add another layer of flavor right here it's going to be all right we're adding another layer flavor right here and it's gonna be all right so at this point we've treated it very simply and we have a simple process but if we pay attention to how this is going to cook down we're going to be able to have something really really tasty in the end all right I'm excited cool so it's another time at 285. it's up in time foreign here we go all right so about two hours later this is what they will have is that correct yeah something like this the things that you're looking for are probably twofold the first is you want that brown color on the meat on the outside that's the myard reaction it's a really complex series of chemical reactions that produce flavor the second thing we're looking for is for the fat to be crispy here we have something that's Savory and Rich but we want to add something that complements it and we're going to add some sauce because it's got sweetness it's got different spices and then we're going to use some apple cider vinegar for the acid apple cider vinegar is great for a lot of things you should also take a tablespoon of this in the morning with baking soda have you ever done that have you ever just had a shot of apple cider vinegar wait you mix apple cider vinegar and baking soda yeah it's really good yeah and just bubbles it doesn't taste good it's like it tastes disgusting but it's really good for you in the morning with a little bit of lemon juice I think you're pulling my legs no I'm being 100 serious my husband says everyone have you ever taken a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar no okay well we're gonna do it all right okay ready yep gonna be good trust me nothing bad will happen to us it's really good for your stomach in the morning I mean it's so disgusting it's like shocking but it's really good for your stomach yeah you see pretty potent that's pretty potent I wanted to be here for that okay so you want to glaze it we're going to dilute the sauce with some apple cider vinegar the sauce is going to provide the sweetness and a really great compliment to the pork belly but the vinegar is going to add acid so do you want me to pour this whole thing in here how much are we putting in here so we're only going to put in enough to where it's not gloopy and that's the the kind of consistency that we want I think that's good that looks good for now yeah let's just see that let me mix that up a little bit yep so you could paint them on you want to paint them on I actually do love painting meat I know it's like a it's a random thing but you are correct that it would make more sense to throw it right in the bowl did that make these look beautiful or what one class I definitely got an in was Art I got an S that's a lie I didn't get it I didn't even take it I cut it okay now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take these guys put them back in the oven for just 10 minutes or so because we want this glaze to get tacky to get sticky so we're not dealing with a bunch of sauce you know that's sticking all over somebody's lips when they take a bite we want it to stick to the meat and then you get all the sweetness and all the flavor but less of a mess okay I love it so this looks like to me it's almost like it looks like General shao's Chicken it does a little bit right it does yeah I like that I'm gonna do the honors of sticking it in the oven absolutely stick my artwork in the oven guys have you ever seen SpongeBob 15 minutes later there we go all right so 15 minutes later it should look like this according to Jeremy yeah this is exactly what we want so we see some of the render fat still leaked out there which means everything in the inside is nice and rendered and then on the top here you see how it's shiny so that's that's telling me that it's glazed it's not going to be gloopy and running everywhere and so you should be able to take individual discrete bites and really enjoy every bit of it well I think there's only one thing left to do I think so up in top just kidding we're gonna taste that I'm gonna do it with my hand before I learned that in Tennessee you can eat everything with your hand is that so okay oh wow way better than General South chicken I like it juicier that's delicious wow and not super complicated I would definitely follow that recipe and make sure I take a shot of apple cider vinegar in the middle for what scientific reason we don't know yet but we're gonna find out on Google oh I know oh it's going to have more acid in your stomach to digest this 100 that's exactly what I was getting at you guys you can follow Jeremy and mad scientist Barbecue on socials and be sure to tag us if you make this recipe it's really good be sure to like And subscribe to Candace home if you have not already we'll see

asked of me he's trying to present as if i was launching a defense of hitler in germany when in fact the question that was asked of me was returning to whether or not i believed that hitler was a whether or not i believed in nationalism and that nationalism was bad and what i responded to was that i do not believe that we should be characterizing hitler as a nationalist he was a homicidal psychopathic maniac that killed his own people a nationalist would not kill their own people that is exactly what i was referring to in the clip and he purposely wanted to give you a cut up similar to what they do to donald trump to create a different narrative that was unbelievably dishonest and he did not allow me to respond to it which is worrisome and to tell you a lot about where people are today in terms of trying to drum up narratives by the way i would like to also add that i work for prager university which is run by an orthodox jew and a single democrat showed up to the embassy opening in jerusalem i sat on a plane for 18 hours to make sure that i was there i'm deeply offended by the insinuation of revealing that clip without the question that was asked of me thanks mrs owens and i yield the remainder of my time thank you mr chair in congressional hearings the minority party gets to select its own witnesses and of all the people that republicans could have selected they picked candace owens i don't know miss owens i'm not going to characterize her i'm going to let her own words do the talking so i'm going to play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about adolf hitler i agree i i actually don't have any problems at all with the word nationalism i think that it gets uh the definition gets poisoned um by uh leaders that actually want globalism globalism is what i what i don't want so when you think about whenever we say nationalism the first thing people think about in at least in america is hitler you know he was a national socialist but if hitler just wanted to make germany great and have things run well okay fine the problem is is that he wanted he had dreams outside of germany he wanted to globalize he wanted everybody to be german everybody to be speaking german all right so my uh first question is to miss hershenoff miss owen said quote if hitler just wanted to make germany great and have things run well okay fine the problem is that he wanted he had dreams outside of germany so when people try to legitimize adolf hitler does that feed into white nationalist ideology it does mr liu i know that ms owens distanced herself from those comments later but we expressed great concern over the original comments great thank you so there's been a lot of talk today i like to focus on actual policy responses that our government can do to try to mitigate the threat of white nationalism i know that in my district in los angeles just last month two swastikas were painted at pam pacific park along with the trail of blood i met with jewish constituents in my district who mentioned that at their synagogues they've all had to increase security as you know there is a non-profit security grant program at the department of homeland security do you believe it'd be worthwhile to increase funding to that program the adl has for establishment reasons first amendment reasons been very cautious and wary of government funding to religious institutions that being said we well understand the fear and the safety so i think that is something that has to be done very carefully in terms of one entanglement i know in the place where i in westchester county where i live the state and local governments provide a great deal of protection uh to the synagogue to which i belong so i do understand and i would like to work more with congress but i want to caution about where we entangle this is a very difficult thing to do because when we're scared like this of course we want money that is a great point you make and i want to know that this program would apply to mosques as well as synagogues so it is not specific to the religion but uh it is true the first amendment does affect all these issues including for example private sector companies who say whatever it is that they want now i'd like to also talk about a second program and this was one that i'm going to ask miss clark about and it has to do with the trump administration wanting to cut a very specific office called the community relations service office in the civil rights division of department of justice can you first explain to american people what that office does and why it would be a bad idea to cut funding the community relations service office is a very critical part of the justice department they are considered the peacemakers they are the ones who step into communities that are embroiled uh in the aftermath of a hate incident uh they are the ones who you'd want to deploy out to louisiana to the parishes where the churches are burning right now they're the ones that you'd want on the ground right after the charlottesville hate rally we are deeply concerned by proposals to cut funding to this office to shift this office to another part of the agency it's important that this agency's work be completely non-political but the very subject matter of this hearing today underscores the urgency of maintaining this office that has been with us for decades and in fact one of the reasons that this office has worked well is because people who go there and get interviewed it is not a prosecutorial office and does that make it easier for people to uh provide information that's right the they are the peacemakers they are the ones who go in and connect with communities that are suffering in the aftermath of a hate incident they connect with victims of of crimes and hate crimes and connect them with services and most importantly they are the ones who help to ensure that an incident doesn't escalate and lead to more tension so we need this agency now more than ever thank you and i yield back gentleman from north dakota mr armstrong thank you mr chairman and i would uh yield my time to mr russian dollar from pennsylvania thank you uh miss owen uh miss owens i'm sorry we just started recording um would you like time to respond to that yes um i think it's pretty apparent that uh mr lube believes that black people are stupid and will not uh pursue the full clip in its entirety he purposely presented an extract an extracted it is not proper to refer disparagingly or with to a member of the committee uh the witness will not do that again witness may continue sure even though i was called despicable um witness may not refer to a member of the committee as stupid i didn't refer to him as stupid that's not what i said that's not what i said at all you didn't listen to what i said may i continue please as i said he is assuming that black people will not go pursue the full two-hour clip and he purposefully extracted he cut off and you didn't hear the question that was asked of me he's trying to present as if i was launching a defense of hitler in germany when in fact the question that was asked of me was returning to whether or not i believed that hitler was a whether or not i believed in nationalism and that nationalism was bad and what i responded to was that i do not believe that we should be characterizing hitler as a nationalist he was a homicidal psychopathic maniac that killed his own people a nationalist would not kill their own people that is exactly what i was referring to in the clip and he purposely wanted to give you a cut up similar to what they do to donald trump to create a different narrative that was unbelievably dishonest and he did not allow me to respond to it which is worrisome and to tell you a lot about where people are today in terms of trying to drum up narratives by the way i would like to also add that i work for prager university which is run by an orthodox jew and a single democrat showed up to the embassy opening in jerusalem i sat on a plane for 18 hours to make sure that i was there i'm deeply offended by the insinuation of revealing that clip

the first time i've gotten this question no you get it all the time i do i do um listen i do not have any plans to run for office at this moment um what an answer you know everybody people are saying candace 2024 i've seen that on twitter maybe how about that maybe favial river bay any well by the way i want to you you are really what's amazes me about you is you have a great sense of humor you're always willing to have a discussion you're you're a fan of good comedy um i think that the world would be a better place if more people had your attitude not all of your attitudes but the one about the one about open dialogue and open discussion and um i want to congratulate you on get and being a mother thank you are you excited about that t-minus six weeks are you gonna be softer when the baby comes out does candace owens go a little softer when she's a mop you know i think that the idea that candace owens is super hard now is more of a media caricature i'm i'm actually quite nice very funny it's the number one thing people say about me when they meet me in person is they're surprised how much of a sense of humor i have um and it's because the media has built me up as this like ah you know person like 300 style all the time um so yeah you go out do people recognize you and are they friendly for the most part yes people recognize me everywhere i go and yeah they're always friendly because leftists unless they are you know planning to be in a group of 300 antifa supporters are fundamentally cowards so if they see me and they don't like me they shut up you know you're not going to approach candace owens and be like i think that's going to go well for you i don't give off the energy that i'm going to be one of those like oh please leave me alone you know i'm i'm like not playing this game i'm not like i'm not afraid of a little antifa thug in an airport you know yeah well i didn't even mean that i just met you go out to dinner in dc is the people the political establishment are they kind of like hey candace is a potential ally do you ever like don't you don't have to say who are there ever people behind the scenes that talk to you that are because you have a very big platform you have a very uh you know big reach is there anybody that's like hey we got to get candace on our side um well no i will say there are a lot of celebrities a-list celebrities that i speak to regularly um and i think it would shock people you know kanye's probably the only one that's been out public about his beliefs that wouldn't shock me because i live in los angeles and i know there's a lot of people that you know watch what you say and and and read what you write and some of them have a big instagram account so they can follow me and follow conservatives some of them don't agree with you some of them do agree with you but they find what you say very interesting right yeah i i think and i think that that's kind of why i'm here um is just because there's just been such a dogmatic approach um to culture and to politics and i just want people to think and i also want to make it okay to be normal like suddenly no nor people have to shut up all of a sudden like it's like unless you've got some something going on or you know it's like so i'm just like listen i'm a happy person and it's like a lot of these people that are trying to be not normal are actually trying like they're not artistic they're not they're not like a genuine where you'd be like oh my god that person's a freak of nature they're amazing it's like someone who's truly trying to exist outside of this spectrum for no reason other than the fact that they don't have much going on i mean i know a lot of people um that where it's like okay you have purple hair and whatever suppose you're non-binary but let's be honest you just work at geico like there's nothing wrong with it you're just answering claims at geico or you're an overlapping yeah they're just at oberlin college and they're like i i want to be interesting and special and different yeah you know everybody everybody wants to be a special little snowflake um and i get that i mean you see that of course you said in hollywood so much too where it's like either complicated for no reason that's what i mean it's like why did harry styles put on a dress because like there's nothing really wrong with harry styles right he's very talented he's good looking he's a great singer so it's like how can i just be controversial and you know put myself in some weird minority box i'm going to be a man that wears a dress like okay we get it you know you know like miley cyrus yeah nothing wrong with people up with money dad's famous i'm going to shave my head and say that i sometimes feel like a man or woman okay we get it you want to be a special snowflake right but like there's nothing wrong with you like you know and so i i poke fun at them and it drives them crazy because they're trying so hard to be different and it's just like dude just be freaking normal it's fine like people will like you either way you don't have to try to be so subversive all the time yeah i mean listen the answer is if you

grew up with is actually a racist homophobic transphobic psychopathic sexist chauvinistic literally Hitler and a phobic killer including but not limited to members of your very own immediate family are you certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's only a matter of time until Trump gets arrested and thrown into a cell with Vladimir Putin and Hillary Clinton will be restored as the rightful president of the United States have you recently liked a tweet from Chelsea Handler or did you stand up and clap at your television when Joy Behar delivered the very fake news that Trump was caught colluding with Russia Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Muller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians does this

shining light of democracy has gone dark feels like the end of the world it feels like we're trying to avoid the apocalypse do you see this as a doomsday scenario this is a different earth today than it was to America is crying tonight I mean literally crying everybody is crying I'm uncomfortable Trump derangement syndrome as a condition that severely impacts the auditory and visionary receptors of those inflicted this means that all aspects of what an individual hears or sees is magically transformed into hate for example I might say I like Donald Trump but a person suffering from TDS years I hate all minorities similarly a healthy person's brain sees this image as Melania Trump arriving to aid those impacted by hurricane but a person suffering from TDs they see her heels and experience

pretty unlikely in fact I'd be willing to bet that they're exactly the same people that you thought they were when you were growing up it's gonna sound crazy but they might just have different opinions you see some people care about the economic state of this country those people are more inclined to like Donald Trump and his agenda other people care deeply about safe spaces and genderless bathrooms and I'd be willing to bet that those people are not walking around wearing a manga hat fact Donald Trump won the presidency in the same way that Obama won it before him the American people voted this is referred to as a democracy I want you to know that no matter how many times joy behar jumps out of her chair and does the funky chicken dance Russian collusion is an illusion seriously

those real thank you so much for having me please please thank you watching this political season I've never heard more discussion about systemic racism institutional racism structural racism and Bator award gave us a new one foundational racism little experiment pick up your magic wand wave it over America and remove every smidgen of racism from the hearts of white America it's all gone now every white person thinks the way Mother Teresa does the problems facing the black community still remain number one absent fathers 70 percent 70 percent of black kids are brought into the world without a father in the house forget about Larry Elder Barack Obama said a kid raised without a father is five times more likely to be poor nine times more likely to drop out of school 20 times more likely to end up in jail it is far and away the number one problem facing black America not systemic racism not institutional racism not structural racism not foundational racism the lack of fathers in the home now what's caused that I was in college in 1970 1965 five years earlier a report came out by a guy named Daniel Patrick Moynihan a lefty he later on became a democratic senator to New York's he's not right-wing not in neocon he talked about the fact that at that time 25 percent of black kids are raised without fathers now 25 percent of white kids are raised without fathers about 40 percent of Hispanic kids are raised without fathers Lyndon Johnson in 1965 launched what he called the war on poverty and supplied all this money for people provided there was no man in the house the number went from 25 percent outside of wedlock to 70 percent today if you look at a graph showing how much money we spent on welfare and the graph showing the increase in kids raised without Father's Day parallel we spent 22 trillion dollars since 1950 to fight the war on poverty and poverty one the second problem if you waved a wand over America and removed all the racism from the hearts of whites would be our public school system 50% dropout rate in public schools in many of our towns if you saw the movie boys in the hood my high school was that movie Crenshaw high school right now front page article LA Times a couple years ago 3% of kids at my former high school can do math at grade level not a typo 3% up from 2% the year before one party wants to allow parents who living with living within that geographical area of that high school to have an option out to be able to go to a better school one party a party that is aligned with the teachers union wants to compel you to send your kid to a school where only 3% of kids can do math at grade level and by the way it is a school school is one of the big gangs in LA the reason I know that is because ice-t 10 years after I went to my high school went there and he chose it because he wanted to go to a school now suppose you are a parent you don't want to send your kid to a school where only 3 percent can do math at grade level and is a school you're shafted you have no choice one party feels that you should be compelled to go to a school whether you can do the math or not where the other kids can do the math or not whether there's a violence problem or not it doesn't matter they are compelling you to go there that alone ought to have people reconsider their allegiance to that particular party that alone are the cause Plex it I would love to say that the three so-called black leaders who are the most prominent in this country are Kanna Solon's Thomas sold Walter Williams but if you subscribe to evany magazine you know every year they have something called the 100-plus most influential black Americans and every year you will not find Walter Williams every year you will not find Thomas so you won't even find Clarence Thomas so a lot of young black people are completely unaware of who these leaders are don't even know who Thomas soul is don't even know who Walter Williams is Walter Williams to my knowledge is the first and only black person to be the chair of an economics department of a non-black University Thomas soul has written over 40 books including two about his trips around the world where he examined virtually every culture every people to find out why some succeed and why some don't and the answer primarily is cultural capital the willingness to believe in yourself and to live in a political system where you have economic and political freedom we have that here that's why people are braving shark-infested waters to come over here to get to America the world has seven billion people I dare say if they can snap their fingers and trade places with us most of them would and here we are whining and complaining about systemic racism institutional racism structural racism and now foundational races are you smoking something and we have to battle of course our left-wing media these people are relentless in arguing that black people or victims black people are persecuted I was on Fox and Friends one morning and we were talking about the number one problem facing the country and that's as I said lack of fathers in the home irrespective of race this is a problem that cuts across all races and I said even during slavery a black kid was more likely to be born under a roof with his biological mother and biological father than today I get back to my office I look at my smartphone media which is one of the left-wing organizations that that covers conservatives on media headline elder says blacks better off during slavery really this is what we're up against now I mentioned that I would like to say that the three prominent leaders are Candace Owens Thomas sold and Walter Williams I can't because if you look at the media the leaders most frequently quoted so-called leaders are Jesse Jackson al Sharpton Louis Farrakhan [Music] there's a book that's out of print now about Jesse Jackson called thunder in America thunder was the nickname that the Secret Service gave him when he ran for president Jesse Jackson was raised in South Carolina and when he was raised his mother was a teenager who was impregnated by the married man who lived next door when Jesse Jackson was raised he was teased because it was rare for a kid not to have a mother and father in the home and he was taunted Jesse ain't got no daddy Jesse ain't got no daddy I am convinced that one of the reasons this man cannot see the tremendous racial progress we've made is because of the pain he experienced when he was growing up I'm not a psychologist but if I were that's what I would argue louis farrakhan louis farrakhan's mother was estranged from her husband had a boyfriend briefly took back up with the husband didn't want the boyfriend to know took out a coat hanger and tried to abort who became louis farrakhan al Sharpton now sharpened at a very comfortable nice middle-class life until his father abandoned the family down to the hood these three men all had either non-existent or difficult relationships with their own fathers that's what they ought to be talking about instead it's racism this racism that racism this by the way they're all multi millionaires how does it happen al Sharpton according the New York Times a few years ago owed five million dollars in taxes how much Jack do you have to earned Oh 5 million in taxes but we're all talking about institutional racism systemic racism and structural racism it is a con it is a con to make sure that ninety-five percent of Democrats line up like lemmings and pull that lever for the Democratic Club nine nine five percent of blacks line up like lemmings and pull the lever for the Democratic Party it's a con it is a lie and what you hear constantly constantly watching these primaries is all this discussion about the police brutality and racism against black people it's not like this hasn't been studied every two or three years there's something called the police public contact serve you look it up tens of thousands of American asked in the last year did you have an interaction with the police if so what is your race what is your sex how were you treated what happened they can't find any pattern of police misconduct are their individual cops who are bad of course individual doctors individual lawyers individual talk-show hosts but is it institutional it's been studied there is a black economist he teaches at Harvard he is so brilliant he became the youngest tenured professor in the history of Harvard and Harvard is the oldest university in the country his name is Roland fryer and because of these high profile cases Freddie gray Eric Gardner Michael Michael Brown Tamir rice he assumed that the police were disproportionately using deadly force against white people so we decided to do a comprehensive study to find out he said the results were the most shocking of my career not only did he not find any so-called institutional racism he found that cops were more hesitant more reluctant to pull the trigger on a black suspect than a white suspect even during even more hesitant on a Hispanic suspect probably because they are deathly afraid of being called racist and they know that it's going to be scrutinized by the media like nobody's business it is simply not true I'm in Los Angeles and years ago the ACLU demanded that cops when they pull over somebody write down the race of the driver they had never done that before and the idea was that the ACLU assumed that cops are pulling over black people disappointedly and also illegally for no reason so now we have all this data and it turns out that blacks are pulled over more often than than our white drivers and according to a study done in 2013 during the Obama administration by the National Institutes of justice which is the research arm for the DOJ it turns out seventy-five percent of black motorist admitted that they were committing some sort of traffic offense when they were stopped it also turns out that you name the offense whether it's speeding whether it's driving without a license driving without a seatbelt driving without headlights you name the offense a black person is more likely to commit it that's why now isn't that good news that you're not being pulled over bits because you're black yet when I give these stats I get all this hostility from people depending upon the audience isn't this good news isn't it's good news that Jesse Jackson al Sharpton the Democratic Party are wrong when they make these arguments about police officers isn't that good news my goodness we live in America for crying out loud when I was born Jackie Robinson had been playing in the major leagues just for years there were thirteen states where it was illegal for blacks and whites to marry there were two people in Congress who were black none in the Senate no governors and yet in 1940 87 percent of blacks lived below the federally defined level of poverty by 1960 that number had declined to 47% a 40 point drop over 20 years the largest period of economic prosperity for blacks in the history of this country can anybody argue there were more racist now than then how are they able to do that how did that happen working hard staying focused embracing your family embracing God that's what kept us together nobody could have had a hand dealt worse than my father are very few people my father was 13 years old born in Athens Georgia during the Jim Crow South and my father had a series had a mother who could neither read nor write my father doesn't know his birthday because he was born in the back of a room and his mother because she was illiterate couldn't write down his birthdate in the in the Bible so my dad knows a year doesn't know the date my dad enrolled in school the lady said what day were you born he said I don't know she wrote down May 25 which was her birthday so I told my dad he has a 1 in 365 chance of it actually being the right date my father came home at the age of 13 and had a quarrel with his mother's then-boyfriend she had a series of men in her life my last name is elder my dad told me that elder was not his biological father I see who's your biological father my dad said never met him my mother had a series of boyfriends each one my dad said more irresponsible than the other one elder was an alcoholic didn't work and when he did occasionally work he brought home the money gave it to my dad's mom he'd want the money back she wouldn't give it to him he beat the crap out of her my dad would jump in he beat the crap out of him this is my dad's life 13 years old he's quarreling with his mom's Vinh boyfriend elder was long gone and his mother sided with the boyfriend through my father out of the house never to return you're talking about a black boy Jim Crow South at the beginning of the Great Depression no siblings going down the road eighth grade education never returned home my father had a series of jobs and he ultimately became a Pullman Porter for the train they were the largest private employer of blacks in those days and he's able to travel all around the country and came to California one time on a stop and my dad was able to go into a restaurant and actually get served that blew him away because in the south he had to have cans of tuna and crap package of the crackers because he never knew whether or not he's going to be able to get a meal so my dad kind of made a mental note maybe someday I'll relocate to California Pearl Harbor my dad joined the Marines I said dad why the Marines he said to reason the Marines out here two reasons you know what the reasons are they go where the action is and he loved those uniforms my dad was stationed on the island of Guam he was a cook he was a master a staff sergeant my dad could look at a cake tell you what's in it gets out of the army goes back at Chattanooga where he met and married my mom he goes around the city to get him a job as a short-order cook and he's told we don't hire my dad was the unemployment office lady says you went through the wrong door go through that door my dad goes out he's colored only goes through that door to the very same lady who sent him out my dad I came home to my mom said this is BS I'm going to California get me a job at the short-order cook come down to California were talking about 1945 1946 walks around for a day and a half I'm sorry you have no references my dad said I cook for thousands of people world war ii and GI you have no references they treated him the same way they treated him in Chattanooga a little more polite about it what's an unemployment office this time just one door my dad sat there for a day and a half lady calls him up says I have something for you sir I'm not sure whether you're gonna want it my dad said of course I'm gonna want it what is it it's a job cleaning toilets and the Bisco brand bread my dad did that for ten years took a second job with another Bread Company cleaning cleaning toilets went to night school two or three nights a week to get his GED and cook for a family on weekends from time to time to make additional money the man never slept that's why I was so grouchy all the time and when my father had this conversation where I found out about his life it was an eight-hour conversation because I didn't like him I thought he was an ogre I thought he had an a trigger temper he used to get mad all the time I now realize he'd never slept 15 minutes here hour here 45 minutes here you do that not day after day but week after week month after month year after year and you walk into a household with three rambunctious boys how are you gonna feel so it's my dad's telling me this my dad got bigger and bigger and bigger and Larry got smaller and smaller and smaller and finally I said dad I am so sorry I judge you so harshly and my father says don't be you just no but follow the advice I've always given you and your brothers hard work wins [Applause] you get out of life what you put into it Larry you cannot control the outcome but you are 100% in control of the effort and before you moan and groan about what somebody did to you go to your nearest mirror and look at it and say what could I have done to change the outcome and finally my father said no matter how hard you work no matter how good you are sooner or later bad things are gonna happen to you how you respond to those bad things will tell your mother in me if we raised a man I wrote a book about it it's called dear father dear son two lives eight hours about

woe is me he never had that mentality victimhood has been a plague across the board for all minorities and and especially black Americans who are being taught that there is virtue and victimhood there is nothing in victimhood there's permanent upset you can wake up every day and feel bad about yourself you can find confirmation bias online to think that we're living in a horrible uh a position when in fact we are the most privileged people that have ever lived in the history of the world that is the truth if you live in America today [Applause]", "f761LIbrj5o": "because of how we all been raised and because of our school systems we all know anything about politics this is who's running for president and this is who you have to go with and that's just what it's always been I never had any or anything like that when Obama ran I just was like oh well vote for Obama and anybody else on the ballot like a lot of people can't I want to say don't read the ballot as long as it says the D next to it they're bubbling in and they're not paying attention to who those people are and what they stand for and I can go and say hey this person has been in office for this long in your community what have they done to better it then I can say that nothing has changed so far everything's still the same actually getting worse like is it is that key of the shackles of the culture to let people know like hey you have to think like that anymore you can have your own mind you can be a free thinker and if it just so happens that I have to switch a party then I have to switch a party [Music]", "koaeXMmkBrM": "we're creating an environment where we're no longer celebrating entrepreneurs we're saying that if you find success there's something fundamentally wrong with you because the rest people have not found success and we know what that what happens you know you want to start that socialist mentality um the people that do think this way are going to leave that's right and they're gonna go to other countries right and they're still going to take their really Brainiac crazy ideas that are going to make them tons of money they're going to bring them to other countries and other governments and once again we are going to be laying the groundwork for America to fall and that's what actually gives me anxieties that people don't see that they don't they don't think that way like you said it's just they see what's in front of them and they don't see the big picture they don't understand the content of human history they don't understand that you you are not um guaranteed to be at the top forever", "AHMBCl1HcoA": "migos this is will wit with Praeger you today we're at UCLA talking to college students and on Olvera Street talking to Hispanics in honor of Halloween and to see if my outfit is offensive would you guys like to chat with us today that's why we want to talk to you about a la find my outfit offensive just you find everything do you find it offensive uh maybe a little do you think my outfit is offensive are you Mexican no yes I think it reaffirms stereotypes that are offensive to people you think people really think Mexican people are like this and carry around watches people actually think that do you find my outfit offensive yes yeah why because it's not your culture cultural preparation why do you say that Mexican food is like cultural appropriation know someone else's culture that we've kind of taken is this cultural appropriation no comment um you don't really understand what their culture means and what it means to wear these things like the hats and the maracas you know you sort of have to understand where all of this comes from for it to not be cultural appropriation it's not yours [Music] can I just ask you do you like my costume I like you your message luckily there's my outfit offend you no no you look nice thank you do you like my costume yes does it offend you no no not that's good me Groppo acaba are you guys

made me this don't get offended yes seems kind of weird doesn't it I love it actually I think it's offensive no not at all some people get really offended by this why do you think that is I don't know just you're not Mexican so people think that you have to be Mexican to wear that celebrating Mexico and that's awesome you Mexican I am see I'm Marinette see that's okay maybe we should swap out exactly ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage speaker and preggers you personality will wear [Music] [Applause] gracias gracias me amigos Ross yes thank you guys so much for being here I was trying to get in today and there's something saying wait we good oh wait okay it's confusing and you have a name alliteration I was trying to get in today and I'm trying to go backstage to get in and I'm like hey I'm one of the speakers they're like wait you're not black I'm like I know I'm the token white guy okay please it's cold out here just let me in no but I truly am honored to be here and and speak at all of Candace's blessed events it's really amazing and to see all of you guys here thank you you guys deserve a round of applause to you especially deserve that because I was at the Women's March yesterday in Los Angeles the things I do for you guys the things I do and nothing makes me happier to be a conservative when I go to that March and I see a overweight naked feminist with a free the nipple sign that'll make you a conservative real quick I'll say that but I've been going to these marches I've been going to the women's March for three years I guess you could say I'm a die-hard women's marcher and every year it's the same where I go and I talk to these people and I say you know what are you doing here why are you marching were you protesting and say oh you know I want to have an abortion at nine months or I love illegal immigrants or I'm fighting for all the people who couldn't be here today I'm like fighting for all the people couldn't be here today what do you mean like well you know all the minorities in America who are being oppressed and couldn't make it to this March today Trump is oppressing them and I'm just like maybe they just don't want to come to your stupid March as what's really going on but as you can see from this video that I just played the left thinks they get a dictate how minorities think and feel when they're supposed to be offended they would probably call these Mexicans token Mexicans they have internalized racism when the stupidest things I've ever heard really live in a culture and a society where outrage has become a recreational pastime this is what a Native American a Navajo when I went to the Navajo Indian Reservation in Window Rock Arizona told me I did another video for Thanksgiving last year where I went to California State University Northridge I dressed up as a Native American I had a friend with me black Mike he was a black pilgrim and yeah very go watch the video you'll see it's very funny anyway we go we go there and we're trying to do a nice Thanksgiving video I have pumpkin pie I'm giving it out to people we're asking people what they're thankful for and if you know California you know those things can't go unheard from the left and so they came and completely destroyed everything we were doing on campus they yell death threats at me they curse to me they took they destroyed my outfit and threw it off and then they chased us off campus you know and that was that was a very strange thing for me you know very very strange and so I wanted to put these ideas to the test the things that they were calling me a racist horrible person am I really a racist and maybe I'm a straight white male in America I mean that's that's what I've been told so I decided to put it to the test and so I went to the Navajo Indian Reservation in Window Rock Arizona 900 miles outside of Los Angeles and I asked them the same questions and what you would find is it's incredible it's my favorite video I've ever done now one of them was offended by cultural appropriation not one of them thought the Washington Redskins name was offensive and not one of them wanted other people to get offended for them on their behalf and that was yeah it's truly in an amazing moment it's not cultural appropriation its cultural appreciation that is what we're doing and so nowadays you see with these college students they're going to college and they're coming out stupid or stupid or a word did I make myself sound stupider by saying that I was just there two years ago so I know exactly what it's like at these university campuses these virtue signaling academics are teaching young people how terrible America is how horrible white people are and they teach them that being triggered is the norm and that it's a shame to celebrate anyone else's culture but what does all this mean all these white leftists getting offended people getting offended there goes my note it really means the white leftists are the most racist people in America they think that their virtue signaling antics are helping minorities but in reality it undermines them black people aren't asking you to get offended for them you're doing it for yourself and so that other people around you will think that you're woke but let me tell you something white leftist there is nothing woke about claiming you care about the feelings of black people when you then go around and advocate for the same programs and policies that have kept black people down in America for decades and you think about something like affirmative action which sounds great on paper right but affirmative action is racist all the way through it basically says all black people Hispanics are not as smart as white people so we need to give them a leg up so that they can succeed send nod racism basically right now but you know why they can't get into these positions that the the white people are in other positions because of the oppression that the left has put on them for the last 60 years you fix the schools in these communities and you fix the welfare state you won't need affirmative action anymore they'll all be even down you know a study actually came out where they showed how leftist talked to minorities and then they also did the same thing with conservatives and they find that they actually dumbed down their speech to talk to minorities they dumbed down their speech think about someone like aoc who goes on and talks to you guys saw that or Hillary Clinton you know Hillary Clinton what's one thing you always keep in your purse hot sauce right hot sauce I always chorus right makes absolutely no sense she is pandering people like Hillary Clinton who have put her own wealth and fortune above the plight of African Americans for decades don't suddenly get a free pass because they say they keep hot sauce in their purse it's disrespectful and honestly it's pretty insulting but you know how conservatives talk to minorities just like they talk to everybody else now I became I haven't always been a conservative no way when I was in high school I actually I worked for a Democrat Senator mostly to impress this girl who I knew but I was also on the Left I thought Obama was pretty cool so shows how smart I was then but everything changed when I went into college I was a went to college in Colorado I was an English major worthless degree and I remember I'm sitting in my intro to sociology class and there's this black girl sitting next to me my TA says she points to me she says you are oppressing the girl next to you because of the color of your skin and the black girl she like looks me and she's like I don't know what's going on this is really awkward for me you know and I'm thinking in my head I'm like I don't feel like I'm oppressing this girl and she doesn't feel like she's being oppressed but this white TA at a fifty thousand dollar year University because to tell me that I'm oppressing someone you know this is how you create a victim culture in America you know that I told the New York Times this exact same story that I just told you guys right now if you didn't see myself and Prager you were on the cover of the New York Times last week no big deal you know just front page New York time but I told them this exact same story and they got something else out of it that you guys probably didn't get you know they they dedicated an entire line that said he did not graduate from college they used this as a means to shame me when reality me dropping out of college was the best decision that I ever made they also tried to say that I was lonely and I was frustrated and I saw these bright graphics from Prager University videos and then I became a conservative right the way they make us sound makes it seem like I was radicalized by conservative views but here's the truth conservative values conservative ideas didn't radicalize me conservative values and ideas set me free and that changed everything for me but I realized once I started becoming a conservative in college is that these ideas these values that I had I've always had them I just didn't know it I just didn't know and this is the same with most people you are born a conservative you are taught to be a leftist a little while ago I've told this story before but a little while ago I was in an uber in Los Angeles I was in a suit I look nice I was going to give a speech my uber driver she's a Hispanic woman and she's like oh you look nice like what do you do what are you gonna do Michael I'm like a political personality she's like oh my god that's so great that we have young people getting Trump out of office thank you it's like yeah I did for sure you know I don't I don't usually talk politics in my uber drivers because I find out you know who I voted for and it's one wrong turn off Mulholland one less of me but I did because I was going to an event and getting motivation I'll warm you up and I found when I talked to her that she was against the welfare state she was against affirmative action she believes in fathers in the homes and she was a school teacher when she wasn't a uber driver and she didn't want them putting transgender bathrooms inside of the elementary school that she worked at and it was like every single value that this woman had was a conservative value we agreed on pretty much everything but she hated conservatives and that's what's going on in America right now that is our greatest thing is to wake people up to the fact that you are a conservative if you just don't know it and you've been completely brainwashed by the mainstream media and univer the main message that I want to get across to everyone today is that these white leftists and politicians you claim to have your best interests at heart don't care about you and that's a really sad thing you know they claim that they they champion your struggles and your issues but they know nothing about what's going on in your communities they've been using minorities for votes for far too long and it's time to end that but you know who does care conservatives conservatives care because they understand that when you succeed everyone succeeds conservatives are the party of America the party of patriotism so they realize that the only way for America to be the best is for everyone living in it to be the best you know I'll end with this is that you guys have been here heard some amazing speakers you know I'm the last speaker and I'm white it's a little racism from Canada so enjoy I said I'll talk to her later about it no problem but you guys heard some some amazing speakers learned a lot but why would you even be here today if you're not going to take that information that you've learned and spread it around everywhere in your communities and everywhere that you go there is no point I live in California any Californians in here don't cheer that's the that is the wrong thing to do okay I live in Hollywood California and I can't I can't even tell you what it's like there I walk outside my apartment there's people smoking crack there's poop there's needles this is an exaggeration this is real how expensive everything is the traffic every well I'm gonna tell you well person I'm there because I want to fix it I live in a place where I want to make changes there and this is what I'm talking about the California has become the way that it is because of liberal policies of left-wing policies but it's also because conservatives have stood by while these things dominate their stay and take over they haven't done anything they've capitulated to the left and this is what we can't do if you're in North Carolina you want to see North Carolina look like Hollywood California I don't think so you have to stand up for your values wherever you go never sacrifice your values for anyone or anything you know I get a I get a lot of the things that I talk about from dennis prager you know obviously Praeger you he's my my mentor and he talks about the ninth commandment the ninth commandment to me basically means to to tell the truth right and with this I think about some of the worst atrocities that have happened over the last 200 years slavery Nazis communism and all of these things are based on lies you know slavery black people are inferior to white people Nazis Jews are inferior communism I mean they've had to name their newspaper Pravda so you can kind of see how that is but I believe that these people you could take a Nazi in Nazi Germany in the 1940s and I'm sure that there were some who were good people in their communities that were good to their families were good to their wives and their children but they were doing evil horrible things they had been convinced that the evil horrible things that they were doing were actually good and this is what's going on in this country right now with leftism is that these people who are leftist and convincing people of their leftist ideas are doing evil things believe evil things that they think are actually good and that's what we have to change what defines every American is not the color of their skin but it's the ideas that they hold on the left in a constant struggle to manipulate these ideas wants to destroy America and keep minorities down forever it's up to all of us to change that thank you everyone [Applause]", "7aRKSwcvdoQ": "we all know the stories that are coming out of schools I mean I have a girl that I used to babysit for who's in high school and the things that they're teaching them you know on a day of school and I'm being serious here on a day of school they're meant to go around the classroom if you have white skin you're supposed to tell them why you feel guilty about having white skin this is in New York City by the way why you feel guilty that your skin is white I cannot comprehend that that's incomprehensible to me because when I was growing up we never talked about color because we didn't see it what they're trying to do is systematically program children to see color because they want them to eventually become activists and they want them to hate one another they see an opportunity in division if you can teach them to be divided young then you can turn them into activists and angry people that become antifa Marchers when they're older", "5Gbxr8eMNHU": "I'm a big believer that we need comedians I think right now we've got we've arrived very suddenly into a politically correct environment where comedians get canceled they're said that now everything they say is too vulgar or too sexist too racist to this and that um and the comedians are there to further the conversation and they should be offensive to everybody every side all the time and I've seen Dave Chappelle be offensive to conservatives that seem to be offensive to liberals and they're that space to me um should be sacred and so I said you know I'd love to meet him I've been a fan of him my whole life um but I will defend convenience to the death of me to say what they want they need to their their ground is becoming less and less sacred and they're being canceled too often", "zs-Oe8jHIUQ": "I just don't see the value in people screaming in a street potentially getting themselves arrested or pepper straight and all that stuff like you

without government handouts I'm insulted by the insinuation that black people aren't smart enough to figure out how to get ID I think we're over overly sensitive hold on hold on I'm just I'm not I'm not I think we're overly sensitive you're right but I'm just saying I believe we're overly sensitive and that because we are overly sensitive our emotions are able to be harnessed by people that just want political advantage over others and that is why we are seeing people that are demonized and call racist and if we don't start to think to start to think clearly and set aside emotion and have conversations um and this is really Black's realities just conferences to talk about abortion we talk about all these different issues the black exit from what the left Democrat Party and going where

ado please give a big welcome to your lexing founder Candice vorlons [Music] what's up Atlanta yes I love this of all the things that I do this is the thing that I love to do most being in a room with free people free minds you know when me and my creative director made that video that you just saw that music video I was I was nostalgic for something those images that you see probably made you feel something like seeing the black family together right that old-school feeling of the black family together and when I started happening and awakening which is what I call it which happened for me a couple of years ago I asked myself some important questions the first thing was what happened to black TV when I was growing up it was the hut stables the Winslows The Jeffersons I was watching Nick at night and I was seeing black families together there was a literal show called family matters Steve Urkel sometimes he was Stephan right said I was cute very cute and now you wake up today and try to think about that that same types of TV they don't exist anymore it's been taken away now we have Love & Hip Hop what is that doing to black minds what is that doing when we're not being told that our families should be together but we should be pursuing a hip-hop lifestyle baby mamas multiple fathers this is what the children are seeing our lifestyle has completely shifted because the media has completely shifted and made things negative so I said what do I want to do with blek said I want to create an experience right I want to remind people what it was like so we can wake up and realize what we've been missing this country has fallen apart we've been further together and yet we're more successful we've made so much progress and yet the the theme of racism seems to be tearing the country apart what you're going to see tonight is a story of black America first and foremost we have to start with where we are I'm gonna come out and speak to you later but there are some people that I want you to hear from first every single person that hits this stage we don't have big names we don't pay people to come here and speak and get you wild up we actually have people that have real stories black Americans that have woken up and realized that something is really really wrong right now within our culture so I hope you guys enjoy the show up first we have an amazing speaker but first and foremost we have to be realistic about where we are today because that video you saw is not where black America is today right now we are essentially in the wilderness and I will show you what it feels like today thank you guys so much enjoy the show what happens to a dream deferred [Music] does it dry up like A Raisin in the Sun or fester like a sore and then Ron does it stink like rotten meat or crust and sugar over like a syrupy sweet maybe it just sags like a heavy load or does it explode [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage author and conservative activist David J Harris jr. this will be on my Instagram later at Twitter god bless you guys man full house up in here are you kidding me how many all came from distances to get here that's the beautiful thing about this movement and this blessed blex it experience is unlike anything else that's happening in the country right now and you guys are a part of it you guys are what is making this experience something that I truly believe is going to change our country forever so honored to have Candace's grandfather in the house sir god bless you sir thank you thank you for what you've done thank you for all that you taught your kids and your grandkids thank you so much for being who you are and raising an amazing young woman pleasure to have you here guys we are in such a pivotal moment in history right now it could not be more divisive on one side and yet more unified on the other looking at this room right now this is exactly what America should be we're unified we're not worried about color we're not worried about gender we're not worried about anything other than what makes this country great and that is the principles of the Declaration and the Constitution and of conservativism that we all hold dear and that's what we are about you know there's so much race-baiting and division that's happening in our country right now it's sad it is so sad and as a person as a man that tries to seek God everybody else in here try to see God as a man that understands that I am flawed and I need a Savior and that is not a president that's not a politician that is Yeshua that's Jesus as a person that understands that I've been saved by grace through faith in who Jesus is and it was he did for me that's what unites us all when you have that understanding that's what unites us all well guess what it's under attack in our country right now and it's the same racial division and divisive nough sticky black folks down in this history in the history of our country that is trying to do the exact same thing today they're trying to tear us all apart and make it all about color well I'm appreciative for blex it that does stand for blacks exiting right because it is so sad to me that for 60 years our black community has been blindly pledging allegiance to a particular political party that I believe hasn't done anything for us [Applause] it is sad to me like many of you in here I'm sure when you're outspoken about your your faith when you're outspoken about your political beliefs when you're outspoken about how you feel about what's going on in our country you get labeled Uncle Tom you know what I say thank you when somebody says that I'm like him please go read the book he was a hero he was a hero you're regurgitating something that somebody told you was derogatory and you even know what you're talking about that is a sad state of too many of so many people in our country today they don't even know why they're standing for what they're standing for this is the movement of set of people saying think for yourself do your own research what are your values what do you stand for and then look at the political parties and say do they represent you and I'm sorry but for me personally I can never vote for a party who's part of their platform was killing babies never I never could I never will ever that was the crux for me and I got it and I got to tell you can I be real with you guys it saddens me and I took some flack I posted a video of me and listening to Kanye's song God is anybody in here here at that song or that album Thank You Kanye West for sharing your heart for keeping it real I'm listening to Kanye's song I'm in my car and I was getting rekt that's what I felt Kanye was saying and what he's been sharing all over the news and his media hits he's saying we've been brainwashed 20 million black babies in this country our God 44 million black Americans and almost half of that wiped out because of a party's platform that is for ending their lives I was overwhelmed by that it doesn't stop there 60 plus million 64 million babies I weep for all the babies but something hit me when I was thinking about how Kanye is saying when I feel so many pastors white or black have failed and how they failed I can hear it already this is how I feel that pastors have failed when they allow a Democrat to come to their church and speak and they promote them openly and then they bash a president that is openly for life of babies they are supporting the genocide of black children of white children and that the growth of this country can I call it what it is [Applause] it's evil stop the genocide I was driving in my car recorded that and I was a bubbling mess I was bawling but I felt God on what I was saying I felt the need to share that bubbling blubberin wet face self video because it wasn't about me how many you guys know it's not about you it's about the message that God wants to push through you how many of you in here are on all four or big tech social media companies Twitter Instagram YouTube Facebook put your hand up if you're on all four of them look around the room leave your hand up if you're on all four of them that doesn't work folks you know why how are we gonna reach the masses when we're only tap it into one social media platform we've got to be on all four of them so that you can share the messages from people that you love and support on all four of them because you know what the left they're coordinated and they don't care about each other's garbage they'll hide it just so as long as they can push that narrative that promotes their agenda we need to be on all four of them I just actually got my page on published on Facebook two days ago I've been battling with Facebook garbage for two years they don't like what I share I don't fit the narrative I've never voted Democrat I didn't vote for Obama I voted for Trump and I'm gonna vote for him again in 2020 cuz he says my values he represents what I represent freedom limited government do you understand the tax cuts the tax cuts alone has brought such an influx of business into our country that it's created 100 billion dollars to go into opportunity zones around this country that's 9,000 communities around all 50 states majority-minority black communities then we're gonna have 100 billion dollars going into that community to rebuild that community and where's the credit you don't even hear about it have Kenya the liberal media doesn't share it they don't want to talk about that they don't want to talk about the fact that he gave three hundred and sixty million dollars to HBCUs last year and then increased it to 400 4 million this year more ed than ever in history they don't want to talk about that oh no no he's supposed to be racist he's supposed to be racist well he just showed up two days ago here in Atlanta to launch the Black Voices for Trump coalition but I'll wait I thought he was a racist he had all they became get up there and speak dr. Martin Luther King's God nice but I thought he was a racist has ben Carson on his administration but I thought he was a racist bit Carson's a brilliant man that came from the bottom and now he's way up there we've got to stop listening and we've got to start promoting we've got to promote the voices that are out there we've got to do it on all four platforms I'm so thankful for what God has done through Kanye anybody else in here thankful before God's done through Kanye's life now don't get it twisted Kanye is still a man like anybody else I don't put my faith in Kanye I put my faith in what I see God's doing in Kanye and what he's doing is amazing and can I talk to the church isn't is there some church folks in here can I talk to the church for a minute are you ready for revival are you ready for revival are you ready for revival because it's coming I believe it's here and we as a church have to know how to love each other and welcome people no matter how they come in we can't try to conform them to what we think a Christian needs to be I hear so much garbage online on my newsfeed social media all you can't trust Karen Donald in another you hear me to say there I said did you ever read the Bible I'm talking to a believer right you're gonna read the Bible you ever heard of somebody named Paul he wrote 19 books of the New Testament Bible the church was forever and will be forever impacted by his life did you know that before he had one encounter with Yeshua he was murdering Christians keep talking about Kanye love believes all it hopes all it endures all we got a believe so many Christians have been praying for revival what if it didn't come in the box you asked for it to come in Jesus or didn't they killed him oh no you're not the Messiah he will kill you we're taking you out for Kanye to have these Sunday services and for his songs to be filled with God's presence there is a convergence taking place I'm gonna hop back into current events and politics for a minute because God's been speaking to me about this for a year I truly believe there is a convergence that is taking place of those that know and love their Poppa God and those that love their country and what it stands for there's a convergence taking place of people just like you of like minds of like hearts that may may not all be exactly in the right place in any aspect of our life but we know we love our freedoms we love our values we love what this country stands for and it's gonna take all of us to get where we need to go to wake up the masses to ask people to be peaceful to people it's so easy to snap on somebody right ooh if you knew me before I knew him I was quick I talk up one side and down the other fast and wait for you to respond in some way that make me want to I'm so thankful that he found me aren't you thankful that he found us there is a convergence happening I've been inspired and challenged personally to know the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence I'm studying it right now it is a beautiful piece of work it is a masterpiece it's unlike anything in history Hillsdale College has a free online course I encourage you we need to know the Declaration and the Constitution and why we believe it and why we need it so much we need to know it so that when we talk to those people that don't know why we feel the way we feel that don't know why we support this president and don't understand the socialist views that are trying to take this country down we can tell them exactly why we're the greatest country in the world the declaration has it mentions God four times it's a beautiful thing the supreme judge our judicial branch talks about him as a legislative branch talks about him as divine providence did executive branch and it talks about him as the Creator it attributes God having the ability to manage all of those different branches but in our government they're individually managed are separated for reason every government that tries to manage all three of those and the stop an autocracy well guess what you get socialism which is responsible for how many millions of debts and when you understand that that's what's made our country so great you're gonna want to fight to keep it that way and you're gonna want to fight against everybody and anybody that wants to try to turn it into anything else I love when our president said the United States of America will never be a socialist country he's fighting for us he's standing up for our values he's standing up to make sure that we continue to have the values that we take for granted so many people take it for granted and you can only take something for granted so long when other people are trying to take it from you and once it's gone it's gone we are the people that are a part of this movement that have the power and the potential and God's presence to wake up the masses we are the people you have the power whatever God is speaking to you I want to pray I don't know where I'm at on time I want to pray because I really want you guys not only from every other speaker but I really want you guys when you leave this place to have a refreshed renewed and laser target focus on what you feel God is asking for you because nobody can live your life for you we have to we are responsible to say yes to what our Papa God asks us I just try to live a life that says yes

silent for word written by Candice Owens god bless you guys thank you all so much [Applause] ladies and gentlemen please put your hands together to welcome comedian and political activist Terrence cave William oh great I'm pleased right for every time I couldn't the greatest artist resting No all right y'all hear me now how's it going Atlanta I'll sit how y'all do on Atlanta look at all these beautiful people in the building baby all these black folks that feel like a family reunion right now feel like but I am talking to my family because we are family but it's good to be in Atlanta but I came out here I didn't come out here to joke around and make jokes none at had I wanted to but I actually wanted to come out here and share my story and let black America know people period know that the American Dream is real that you can be any body eat that you can do anything in this country that you want to do no matter where you come from so a lot of people ask me Terrence so you know how was your upbringing did you have a mother and a father were you in a two-parent household and I actually grew up in foster care my mother and my father were both addicted to drugs my mother had nine children six different fathers and none of them were around and she eventually lost us in the system she lost her rights eventually I was in and out of shelters homeless shelters children shelters no family separated from my siblings I never even dreamed of being on a stage like this at all coming from where I come from but this is America no matter where you come from no matter how you are brought up you have an opportunity but I had many choices I could have sold drugs I used to be inspired to be a drug dealer I wanted to be a thug I want to gangbang well first of all I'm too small anyway so that's one reason why I really didn't go down that route I'm gonna just be honest with you Oh Lord Jesus [Applause] oops no but for real though I've been in over about ten different foster homes and there were times I feel like I could never be anybody that I met I don't even know I used to be like I don't have a chance my mom and daddy ain't around I'm not about to be nobody I'm look you know what i'ma just sell sell drugs and make money don't nobody love me anyway I stayed getting in trouble because I felt like nobody loves me I feel like I didn't have a chance I felt like the world owed me everything I felt like I was a victim and a lot of people made me feel like I was a victim Oh Terrence it's okay he was in foster care it's okay that you did that don't worry about it you're in foster care you have an excuse but to be honest with you there are no excuses there are no excuses don't nobody oh you nothing I don't owe you nothing I don't owe you nothing the white man Bob don't owe you nothing the white lady Sally and Tammy don't owe you nothing you know who owe you something you owe yourself [Applause] and once I realize that I got my head on straight once I realize that but it took me a long time it took me a very long time to realize that then nobody owed me nothing I mean when I was thinking people hold me stuff what nothing coming to me so I'm not gonna lie that held me out to I'm like well maybe I gotta get it on my own but I just really want people to know people would understand I go around and I talk to foster kids to at-risk kids to people with no mother no father and there are a lot of people out there that believe that because they grew up that that they believed that they grew up a certain way that they grew up from update' they started from the bottom that they cannot make it to the top and that is a lot that is a lot we have the same opportunities that everybody else got okay you just gotta get up off your butt get up off your narrow behind stop being lazy and take those opportunities start walking through those doors okay there are people in this world right now that grew up with a mother and a father I grew with no mother and no father and I'm doing way better than them you know why because this is America you can do anything you wanna do [Applause] I love y'all Elena I love y'all Elena I love y'all and I really want the best for everybody not just for black America not not just for black America but for America period I want the best for everybody black people need to know that the American Dream is true white people need to know that the American Dream is true Hispanics asia's everybody we all go through things everybody go through something okay you're not the only one struggling with something you are not the only one oh my blood pressure Lord Jesus I don't know how much time I got but I don't care no boat Kandice going to drag me off this stage cuz I'm not going nowhere I'm feeling the spirit and I'm doing what I say I'm doing I'm playing Candace cajoled cuz Candace is grab all in the building and I'm about to disrespect your granddaughter cuz she told me you don't play so yeah yeah yeah and I want to touch on something that David Harris was talking about about killing babies and killing black babies a lot of I've heard some people say well you know what Terrence your mother should have a border child so you didn't have to go through what you went through people have an excuse for killing babies all if the mother is not financially stable she should kill the babies no no no no no no no no no no no and that's why I think my mom even though I went through what I went through I'll still love her and I thank her for not aborting none of my I think her for not a book she had nine children and she didn't she did not abort none of us at all and I thank her for that because she because you know what we all deserve to be here no matter what just because your mama broke don't mean you gotta die you want me that - cuz my mother came by no fool it's people after they wanna feed me but you want me to die oh no no no no so I am totally against aborting babies I'm totally against I don't care what you say okay because people say I should have been aborted because my mama was not financially or mentally stable to take care of me but guess what I started out in the foster homes made it all the way to the White House baby I said I made it to the White House the American Dream is real we're from the foster house to the White House baby so you can't tell me black people don't have opportunities in America you can't tell me little black boys in the hood can never be anybody that's the dang love because I'm some body baby and what you not about to do you're not about to tell me what I should believe in and who I should believe in and who are shallow fo you Oh Lord Jesus no because I I get pissed off when people try to control me where people try to tell me who I should believe in okay I believe in what I want to believe in okay because I'm a free black man in America baby baby we in Atlanta Georgia but Martin Luther King walked these streets in protest so I have to say what I want to say let me please you know what Atlanta I love y'all so much it was a blessing god bless america you can do whatever you wanna do baby [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] well guess what I'm the threat we just smart black man I don't care about your life so you say he's not doing anything for the people right now as oppressive St Louis back on the appointment Louis Asian unemployment Louis Latino unemployment hundred billion dollars throw his black community's first step back chair reform bill stop walking as all-time high best economy we've ever had he's all in fact you can google it right now what has he done to benefit the country I just told you repeat it [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay nobody stopped I'm Republicans about care for perfect an if you take me can do when we walk the or the end of you have it yourself and that's the island you black are you a Democrat you're an idiot it's a choice to be a slave you're not a slave I like Obama because he was spoon all criminals are smooth they don't want to represent a country get out of here we Americans Republic because we took you out sleep at this crazy last president seems to be doing a lot for the minority yeah wanna pay this narrative make white people feel guilty but stuff they had men to do it that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] but I'm black I'm not fooled you're talking like this that means I'm dumb that means I can't do anything let me Zack to think like everybody else we have to be she didn't have to sell you a phone from you cuz Blackie will just give it away how you get so much vapor on your side except imagine Lord and Savior that should look that neighbor not too bad I'm a bad it's so good his light shine the brightest in the dark single mothers know they get my brothers like the barnyard you can still bring anything you wanna be oh hold on hold on hold on hold on nein nein nein nein gonna do it like that I gotta soak this up let's do it again I gotta soak this up I'm gonna soak this up you know it's a funny thing the reason why I told you how to be this excited cuz I ain't supposed to be here can you imagine that a former gang member from Brooklyn Queens New York one of the rougher places there Brooklyn Queens New York is here right now on this stage with these amazing speakers can you believe that now that's supposed to be damn near impossible right but that's the BS that they tell us in our community that because of your background and your circumstances that you can't be successful in life I have an eighth grade level education I don't know the difference between there there and there and you're on your if you go on my page right now however you say you are but I'll put why oh you are I don't know the difference but that isn't stopping me from being able to be here today working hard and dedicating myself and believing in myself and I can't where nobody had to say [Applause] the coolest part of the world was this is that uh I got invited to the White House tattoos on my head tattoos on my face with the flyest suit in the world and you know it's true cuz the president United States says so so it's a fact but this is what I really want to talk about most importantly man us as a people and when I say people I'm gonna have to say black you know but I believe everybody's my people but I want to speak to my people in specific we got to start being accountable we got to stop acting like we have to have some sort of excuse for why we can't do what we want to do in our life because there's no excuses I remember what I used to tell people you could do whatever you want in the world they're gonna know what we can't be President so then I went and voted for the first black president just so I could make sure they can't have that excuse anymore not because he was black just so you can't tell me you can't do something because look at me I'm the prime example that you could do whatever you put your mind to you know so that's my goal my goal is to go out there and teach young men like him right here that despite of anything that you're doing like can nobody stop you and I'm the prime example I don't care where anybody tells you that's why I go to different communities and I speak to them I say yo what's going on man how you of why you still on this corner yo man this is what I'm supposed to do you know because you know the white man you know he trying to stop me from doing what I want to do well I ain't never met that white man have you ever met him and if anybody knows where yeah we need to all get together and go jump in [Applause] I'm just saying are you him are you him is that you huh is it you let's make sure cuz if so you got a lot of us see here we ready to jump you you know say but like I said man I ain't really got too much to say I know I've gotta do like 15 minutes of rambling and stuff like that but I just want to be here to understand that look man I I looked at myself one day and I realized that I was the problem and I was tired of being the problem so I said how can I change that that's when I got up and said yeah I'm gonna start some of people change your life man let's start voting because that's one of the biggest problems we have in our community we think our votes don't matter and that's a lot that's why we keep having these people in office they don't do nothing for us that's why when I hear black people say oh well has the Republican Party done for us well nothing you don't vote for them [Applause] I don't vote for them so would you expect them to give you you know Bobbitt is only care about two things donors and votes so if you if you've been voted for party for about 30 40 50 years and you got nothing from it I'm sorry people you're an idiot [Applause] I'm just saying I mean I wouldn't be hiring somebody to do a job at my house I never do nothing to continue to give them a check I know this ain't the PC word but uh that's [\u00a0__\u00a0] and I could tell here a lot of people here got definitely not [\u00a0__\u00a0] so I'm not here to convince you to vote for a Republican or anything like that I just want you to make the right choice and don't be afraid to make that choice don't be afraid to weigh your mag ahead so you're proud to be American attire because that's necessary if all you here was to wear your megawhatts and wear your america make America great again outfits who you think is gonna mess with us they're trying to say that with a silent majority does it look like we decided majority I can't hear you you're acting like they're not here so we're not deciding majority so don't be afraid oh um I gotta say this to my white friends don't ever be afraid for somebody to call you racist if it's racist for you to support a president that makes sure we had the lowest black unemployment to make sure black babies they be killed to make sure there's money invested in our community well tell them you the best racist ever I mean and somebody please do me a favor can somebody tell Donald Trump how to be a racist cuz he's not doing a good job he let this black brother right here with tattoos on his face in the White House I used to gangbang I used to gangbang I've done a lot of things that I would say that I'm ashamed of but then again I wouldn't be here today if I didn't do those things you know I had to understand that I wasn't being punished in life I was being prepared so I want you guys on that statue you know recently I just invited Jesus into my life I gave him the wheel the show you soak this up and I want to definitely thank my brother David Harris I was on the phone with him for about like two hours and he's telling me you know Papa misses you he wants you back home and I'm talking to him I'm like where did I go I didn't I didn't go anywhere but he was like you know he needs you to be that voice and he spoke me for two hours and I was like and I thought to myself why not let Jesus into my life why not I mean I've gotten this far without him but uh I got even father Widow I came here with no money because a lot of people believe that the present United States is paying me for this somebody please show me what my check is there you must got the wrong address cuz I ain't get a dollar but at the end of the day I gave him what's that phrase that Christian is like to say you give Jesus the will boy he could drive he could draw I mean he got a hoopty you know but he could drive you know I came here with literally zero dollars but I ain't focused on that I got people like Candace Owens who supports me and her husband George I love him that's my guy you know he'd say so me and they made sure I was good when I got out here so I didn't have to worry about anything I just trusted in Jesus and say you know cuz I'm not a Christian I want to make that clear and I know but I don't follow Jesus and what did Jesus do Jesus didn't hang with the rich and the popular and the famous he hanged with the hoodlums murderers killers thieves scammers those are the people that he wanted to reach and these are the people that I want to reach I want to reach the people that they think we don't care about our future what we do it's just that we have nobody to represent that you know because in my community we don't want to talk to no broke people we don't want to talk to the uppity black man that thinks he's better than us and wants to speak proper I believe me understand in 90% of the things they be saying anyway all these big words I'm like good a lot so it determined it turns us from actually listening to the message that's why I think it's important for people like me to be able to be out there and speak to them and say listen check this out you could do it too I ain't gonna let me tell you how hard it is to be on this stage and not curse I go live see ya I had a word about it Candace Toby I might get spanked by a grandfather I don't want no smoke grandpa I don't want no smoke but at the end of the day man I'm not gonna kill y'all with a long speech I just want y'all to know this man no matter what you do in life believe in yourself they don't matter what anybody tells you because look at me tattoos everywhere former gang member then did the worst things in history you could even imagine but the most beautiful thing about this country called America I got an opportunity to right my wrongs so don't think you can't right your wrongs period listen man is King face thank you for listening to me thank you forgive me the time I love y'all thank you whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on hold on I got to get this for the ground yeah buggy I got to get this for the ground hold on now give me a minute cuz I ain't taking my whole 50 minutes y'all gonna

service is that there is a unifying mission about it isn't there I mean when you know that you could potentially face combat with your fellow Marine your fellow soldier your fellow Navy person you don't care about the color of their skin you don't care what part of the country they came from the only thing you know is that you've got each other's backs and you know what our country could learn a lot from the military right now it's about time we came together and started having each other's backs instead of trying to tear each other apart now look I just came here from Virginia and we're in some we're in some very serious wars in Virginia you may know about our governor there I ran against our governor for lieutenant governor and when we had a debate on television I reached out to shake his hand he refused to shake my hand I tapped him on the side to get his attention he refused to even acknowledge I was there later on they found him with a picture of a blue Klux Klan outfit and blackface and then shortly thereafter we heard him say that he supports abortion and if at all is intended to be aborted and that child is born live well I think we can then decide whether we want to let that child die or not that's governor Ralph Northam of Virginia he's supposed to be a pediatrician I'll tell you what I wouldn't trust him with a born child let alone an unborn child he has just gotten the legislature to go along with him unfortunately on Tuesday we elected a legislature that will back him but I'm here for Virginia to tell you all that the state of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry and James Madison and James Monroe and George Mason is not going to lie down and roll over and turn our Commonwealth over to a bunch of Marxist and socialists we're going to bring Virginia back from the brink now my family comes from Virginia my great grandparents were slaves and sharecroppers in Orange County Virginia my grandfather was raised there he later left and I was born in Pennsylvania I was born into a broken home I was raised until the age of 10 in foster care and my father came back into my life at the age of 10 years old I was raised up in poverty I ate mayonnaise sandwiches sometimes and biscuits in syrup for dinner but my father came back into my life and he turned my life around I was a juvenile delinquent I was running the streets I was not paying attention I didn't want anybody to have any authority over me because I resented the fact that my parents weren't there and I'm telling you everybody's got a solution to our social problems we need to control guns we need to have more programs but you know what we need an America we need to get men back in the home we need to get families raising their children and teaching them right from wrong and respect for authority [Applause] that's what happened for me my beloved father made all the difference in the world in my life and you know what else he told me and my father was born in 1915 he was raised in a very different racial climate than anything I've ever experienced but my beloved father told me when I was a young boy he took me to live with him he said son this is the United States of America he said it's not a perfect place he said but you can be anything you want to be in this country if you make up your mind that you want to do it my father had a sixth grade education was a third-class welder and son ship building and drydock company but he raised up a salary took out of foster care I graduated summa [\u00a0__\u00a0] Lord from the University of Massachusetts and from Harvard Law School because in America you can start from nowhere and become something and make something out of yourself I am tired of having liberals tell me what I can't be tell me where I can't go tell me what I can't do I'm tired of being treated like I'm some kind of handicapped second-class citizen I want to tell every black citizen every Hispanic citizen don't you let liberals tell you what you cannot do you can do anything you make up your mind to do this is the best place in the world to live you've been blessed to be born in the United States of America and no we're not a perfect country I know that but you know I made up my mind at this time in this state in in this day and age anybody who's so dumb that they were judge a person by the color of their skin you don't need to worry about them anyway my brothers and sisters we live look this is not heaven I know that I preach about heaven this is not heaven but you compare it to anyplace else in the world that's why we don't have people standing at our borders say please don't leave please don't leave in fact I tell you some of these folks I'd like to say please leave because even those who complained oh this is the greatest nation on earth we live under the most successful governing document in the history of mankind constitutions are changed around the world about every seventeen years here we are 230 years under the Constitution of the United States and we're going to keep this constitutional republic that was given to us by our founding fathers I [Applause] raised my hand on a Marine Corps office in August of 1970 I took an oath to the Constitution of the United States that I would preserve protect and defend it against all enemies foreign and domestic and bear true faith and allegiance of the same every veteran in here took that same oath I have more commitment to it now because I believe it's in more danger now than it's ever been and my brothers and sisters are Benjamin Franklin walk out of the Constitutional Convention September 17 1787 a woman named mrs. Powell met him and he asked she asked him well doctor what have you given us a monarchy or Republic he said a republic if you can keep it and I'm telling you all by the grace of Almighty God with everything that's in me we're going to keep it nobody's taking it away from us but my brothers and sisters we've got to have unity we've got to get past this racial division this this division over racism and sexism we've got to be one nation under God and then we'll be indivisible with liberty and justice for all that's why I don't mind confessing to you at I know my history I know my background I know the African heritage that I have but I'm telling you all this I do not call myself an african-american I am American our ancestors may have come on different ships but we're all in the same boat now and we better start acting like it and so I just want to encourage you don't don't give up don't back down stand up for what you believe in those of us who are of African descent know that we've got a challenge to help people understand who come from our backgrounds or similar backgrounds to help them understand you've been lied to you've been manipulated you've been used they're keeping your children and not accredited schools that are miss educating them they're keeping you locked in ghettos they're destroying families they are boarding your babies it's time for us to tell them we need to be free let my people go so my brothers and sisters I am convinced that America's best days are ahead I mean that when I look out and see you all I know that's got to be true my daughter's here my beloved youngest daughters here and she was raised up to do something with her life she doesn't walk around thinking people won't let her do this and they won't let her do that she just got her executive mba from one of the schools here because that's America that's what I taught my children that but what we're doing we're doing for you younger people see I'm I look my mind that the Sun is going down in assets on my life I'm in my third quarter but I see some of you were in your first quarter and we want to make sure that the country that we leave you is one where you can be who you are be proud of who you are stand up who you are and not be told oh you believe that oh get out of our way are you believe in marriage you believe your mother and father were yeah yes I believe in marriage is God and whoa wait a minute wait a minute you're bigoted you're hater are you believing the free market system no no no we need socialism ouu believe people ought to come together and care about one another regardless of race or color or creed or any such thing as Americans oh no no no you don't understand the white man is against us all we don't want our children raised up in a country like that where they're taught to hate one another be against one another we want to be raised in a country where they know as a fellow citizen we care about one another we don't need the government to order us to care about our neighbor we ought to care about our neighbor because it's the right thing to do I want these young people to be able to feel the same thing we feel yes I'm a patriot you can get you can sense that they feel the same thing I feel when they hear that national anthem and look at that flag and get emotional about it because I know the blood that's been shared I know the tears that have been shared I know the sacrifices that have been made I know the lives that have been given in order to secure this unique Liberty that we have in this country and I want them to feel what we feel when we look at those symbols the flag is not a racist symbol it represents my country in your country and if we can't rally around the symbols that represent us all we've got a future do we have and please don't let me get started because when when a spoiled multi-millionaire who couldn't make that kind of money in any other country on ours has got the nerve to tell me that because he's got an issue he won't stand for the flag or they won't stand for the flag or they won't stand for the national anthem I'll tell you what as far as I'm concerned find yourself a country you like better and go there and don't come back don't disrespect my flag don't disrespect my country there are some things about my country that I want to change yes but I love America because I know what America means to all of us we have created the most successful most prosperous country raise the standard of living for more people than any other nation that's ever existed on the face of the earth I know we endured eight years of apologies for America but I'll tell you what I don't care how you feel about him thank God now we got a president who doesn't apologize for our country but it's proud of America loves our country and let me tell you something folks there's nothing racist about putting America first this is my home of course I put my own country first so don't be afraid to stand up be encouraged because I really believe that truth forever on the scaffold wrong forever on the stone but the scaffold sways the future and behind the dim unknown standeth within the shadows keeping watch over his own truth is going to win out over falsehood so keep standing because I really believe that this nation will have a new birth of freedom I saw a young man in the back wearing a second ammendment shirt let me tell you something our founding fathers weren't perfect people but when they set this nation up on the basis that rights aren't given to us by the beneficence of government or by some king or potentate but they are inherent in who we are as human beings given to us by our Creator that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness they secured our rights in something that cannot be change and yes I have a right to freedom of speech I have a right to my own conscience what is wrong with these liberals what is wrong with them because you know what I mean this with all my heart I may not agree with them but I will defend their right to say what they think I mean that why is it that they want to shut Candis down why is they want to shut us down they don't want us to be heard well I've got news for them there's no power on earth that can shut us up or shut us down we're going to keep crying aloud we're going to keep saying it until nobody but nobody disagrees with us we're gonna keep persuading people that america is the land of the free and the home of the brave [Applause] that's right USA USA USA USA USA now I might be running out of time so let me let me finish up this nation is going to have a new birth of freedom because of you because of you and let me tell you something to all of my brothers and sisters who happen to be of darker hue when we start uniting not on the basis of what somebody looks like but on the basis of what they think like when we start uniting with the basis of ideas and principles and ideals we will break the back of the leftists who want to turn this country into a Marxist socialist nation cuz they're guaranteed they're trying to guarantee their power by manipulating black folks and Hispanic folks and women and convincing us that we're victims of racism and sexism but I want you to say aloud and not backup I am nobody's victim of racism I refuse to be a victim of anybody for any reason [Applause] I'm a proud American who happens to be black if you want me to bend over and let you ride me as your victim it's not going to happen so stand up and be counted and don't back down and I guarantee you in time to come people are gonna join in with you and those young people are going to sing with with new meaning my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee I sing land where my fathers died land of the pilgrims pride from every mountainside let freedom ring keep saying it until they all come into agreement with us and say yes I believe in America I believe in what my country stands for and no we're not a perfect country but I guarantee you this we're the best place on earth to live and look don't you dare back up from that at all now Candace has experienced it I've experienced it threats nasty names you know I mean believe it enough folks I'll be up and called the white supremacist a sellout simply because I say if you don't want to be judged by the color of your skin why would you judge someone else that way that's that's that's being a white supremacist you don't want anybody judging you on the basis that we will you your black black folks are like this but but it's okay to say well white folks are like that that's a lie that's that's that's disgusting it's it's desist it's degrading we ought to reject that because that's not what the civil rights movement was all about dr. King said we want to be judged not by the color of our skin but by the content of our character [Applause] but I hope that you will join it with me in keeping this commitment I'm probably older than most of you in this room but it's a commitment I made a long time ago and I hope you'll join in it with me I said I don't care what anybody says about America I don't care what they say about my faith I don't care what they say about my commitment let me make something clear I love everybody there's not a person on the earth that I hate I don't care how much they disagree with me or what they say about me I love them I pray for them I tell people I didn't agree with President Obama but I pray for into tears I prayed for him to tears literally because I loved him and I still love him and pray for it but I just don't agree with him but I love people we're not against people we want the very best for people we want everybody in America to experience the very best there is but they'll call us bigger than haters because if you don't agree well you're a bad person but you know what I don't care what they say about me I don't care what they say about our country I'll get what they say about a flag don't care what they say about our national anthem our Constitution our founding fathers or our way of life I am going to stand up for that flag and stand up for that Constitution and stand up for our way of life until I breathe my dying breath but I will never give up I will never give in I will never back down I will never be silenced I'm going to do it until the Lord calls me home and I hope you have the same attitude because if we have that attitude we're going to win we're going to win god bless you god bless Atlanta god bless the United States of America [Applause] the safest if I'm selling the pipe is to give the baby the diapers ball of good Swiffer cuz all she know was wipers buckle breath ladies and gentlemen please give a warm welcome to the founder of organization black guns matter and moss to Ray [Music] we're gonna make it nice and awkward we're gonna make it nice and awkward sup you hope ain't none of y'all streaming this to the gram oh good how many Democrats we got in here no so jobs gonna make it awkward ain't nothing here what is one identify yourself okay now look this R is gonna get awkward is that a man or I'm not being funny cuz I can't see that far is that assistant that's a woman okay that's our sister too okay so I got 15 minutes and this 15 minutes the best way for me to help is to engage in dealing with three basic concepts empathy facts and solutions all right now we all agree that we in the middle of a war okay whether that's spiritual whether that's political whether that's whatever a war of hearts and minds right now just like I sister over there she's outnumbered in this room by a small margin right but with that being the case on the outside of this room even though we're the silent majority mass media some of them are here now are gonna paint a picture that we're the minority with that being a case you have to have all of you have been pushing for the things that you're about about freethought about solutions about all those different things you're struggling with certain things especially my white people that's down will blech sit you're struggling with it because you want to say the things that the black people is saying but you're gonna get painted this race is about some of them saying cameras right no different than the mela native beings in here notice I said melon ate it beans okay dumela native beings in here that are communicating about the things that are about liberty free thought and things of that nature you're gonna get painted somebody say a name that they're gonna call you BAM off top bed winch tap-dancing they don't say that to me cuz I'm strapped most of the time so they know better than that okay so the best way for me to hit one of the ways is you can be armed that's just my thing with that being the case the best way for me to help y'all because every single person in here has struggled with this and you have to reach the reason why the people our brothers and sisters right are still in that same thought process it's because that same media has made it very adversarial so I cannot help you I'm around the country doing this work I'm in liberal cities talking about arming black people people get their heads blown off for doing what I do okay so I've had some success cuz I haven't got my head blown off yet alright and somebody coming with me when they try okay now with that being the case it's just made it awkward everybody got scared with that being the case the best way for me to help y'all it's for you to ask questions I got a couple of minutes and I'll answer them based on my experience anybody can jump in you can ask a question but I need two at a time and we got to move quick I cannot serve you if I don't know how to help you so when I say this if nobody ever wants to go first so whoever wants to go first no wait where's the sister that's the Democrat what are you a question what are you feeling right now I want to ask you that question first okay speak up stand up unless you want to tag somebody in accent and respond for you now wait real quick this is a no pun intended this is a safe space we are all agreeing that we are going to respect our sister correct the tolerant right okay go ahead my sister mm-hmm so y'all heard what she said I'm gonna say it again she said that basically what she's recognizing is regardless of the rhetoric that's it that's it um that's a media turn by the way right regardless of the rhetoric on the blacks its side on the left whatever we all pretty much want to defend basic freedoms commonality we'll television tell you that no why not there is energy resources money and power and division it chaos okay this is not the Tower of Babel this is actually communication they want you babbling not talking over each other not to each other that's why I start these type of state these you know speeches finding out who is the quote-unquote other our sister dear she's not really the other she's not a day the people that we're trying to engage are not a day either the bishop just burnt it down by breaking down we are all Americans okay melon ate it and now I'm melon ate it don't care so that's the first thing now who got the question yeah brother right here just speak up man come on what's up gently yeah yeah yeah excellent question so basically excellent question Chandler so basically how do you get because the schools are cesspools of leftist propaganda be very clear about that okay how do we get especially in a younger group how do we get an understanding of having young people engaged in the Second Amendment you know you I don't use the word gun very few people even see me with a firearm I allegedly have a whole bunch of them okay when we started black guns matter our whole goal and approach was the conversation is about conflict resolution safety de-escalation and the Second Amendment defending the right when my gay friends that are very liberal I say man if you knew somebody in a pulse nightclub would you want that person to have an option to defend their life it's not adversarial it's a simple question the major part of that is again that first one empathy on three saying I want you to say it with me one two three the people that you're talking to don't agree with you right now because they have not read the same books write it down it's really good okay so Chandler in that space the first thing that you got to do recognize that empathy then explain this this is about a right if you do not want to have the right to defend yourself you don't have to and i'll champion your right to stay on the left right with that being the case you do that from a place of infinite empathy then the second one is data or facts the fact of the matter is over 90 percent of the mass shootings that we see even though they make up less than 1% of shootings in the nation because those cameras say us oh you go outside you're gonna get shot even though they make up less than 1% ninety percent of them are in gun-free zones empathy facts next question I'm gonna make it nice and boring - I have - I couldn't match the bishop's energy go ahead brother yeah uh-huh yeah yeah yeah okay excellent question so I do a bunch of different things in that regard so his question is okay what does every rap song say a magazine is clip that's wrong it's wrong okay now you know the intent of the person that's saying it people used to say yo what's up my [\u00a0__\u00a0] to me all the time and I used to go yo I'm not a [\u00a0__\u00a0] after I you know I mean however the intent cuz when I started creating that adversarial I know what he means but I don't want to be offended by the word or triggered so I say I'm not a [\u00a0__\u00a0] as opposed to going this brother does not understand cuz we haven't read the same books it's the same thing with the nomenclature around firearms I understand if they say a clip hey bro you mean magazine rape and a light-hearted way the left media has a PhD in PR they are better at it than us so you have to adapt I know what he means and I have to educate you have to do that every single time you are charged now with this Fight Club you and my Fight Club your homework assignment is every time someone says what's up my [\u00a0__\u00a0] what's up my cracker what's up my [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm using all of the derogatory to him so I leave anybody out okay I understand what is their intent and if there's a way to bridge that gap there you explain where their nomenclature is not incorrect but I know what you mean but here's an add-on that's empathy then you hit them with the facts that creates the third thing which is the solution does that make sense and the other thing is you got to know your nomenclature if you think 1911 is embedded in Glocks then you probably already out of the game the gun people gonna laugh you right there oh there's sister got in front of you brother I got you next guy's sister she's running for Congress thank you for your service uh real woman Carrie uh-huh yeah mm-hmm yes you can you shoot him in the face I agree her question in essence is how do we get women to understand now they'll be very clear the people that are getting a little squeamish I am not advocating for any unnecessary violence be very clear about that I deal with conflict resolution and de-escalation however if a woman is attempted to be raped by a scumbag shoot him in the face that goes back to this brother's question here and I got you brother I forget about shooting I got you that goes back to that statement again empathy man I understand that you have the right is your body your choice do you want to put if that's your languaging do you want to protect your body do you think a man a violent man has the right to just rape you or your daughter would you want your daughter or your sister or your mother or your grandmother to have the means to defend herself non-adversarial empathy it's the second one facts third one solution brother right there sub Jonathon word outstanding brother [Applause] mm-hmm Onis yeah so I'll tell you what I did black doesn't matter started we was going to do one event it was going into 2015 going into 2016 elections and you know how I go every especially the presidential elections register to vote register to vote register to vote I live in Philly I just got my butt kicked running for City Council I learned a lot but I still took that Eldo okay so they sit next time so what they say is Philly's 80% Democrat okay what they'll do is they'll say voters registry register to vote register vote register to vote I got you now during that time we was like yo we don't need a registration to vote Drive we didn't license to carry Drive so what I did was I started getting all of the paperwork I printed them out and I just started handing them out to people and showing them how to actually fill out to get the license to carry right now when you take those people and you get them their license to carry you show them the paperwork all that now they have an interest once they have that interest and then you show them and again I have plenty of friends and family that are us on the Left like I sister there right we have so much in common but when you start showing them you're enjoying this thing shooting sports for recreation whatever as well as to defend against tyranny on top of again the rapist can get shot in the face when you start showing that there are democratic policies racist policies of gun control specifically designed to de armed black people primarily when you show them that after they've got an interest for this thing they'll start voting a different way then you create a voting block off of that okay but the first step get the paperwork know it like the back of your hand front and back handed the people the people that don't want one and say no I don't want one cool I respect your right to not have a firearm empathy facts solution what was the brother over here somewhere brother back there okay that was all Candice bro they don't messenger so I was I came in the back bro so I'm just joking I'm just joking I'm respecting the rules so here's the thing I'm personally a libertarian okay now again that's not knocking again it's different free thought with that being the case when I go into my anti-gun friends homes that are afraid of firearms I don't take a firearm I make a joke I say yo bro if I die if I get killed in your house I'm gonna kill you right I believe in a free market I believe that this space right is allowed to create the rules that they were I can choose to not dumb or I can choose to go I thought being here with you tonight you all was important enough to come unarmed that's it respect freedom respect liberty who else I'm gonna do a couple more on how much time I got right thanks for what you do thank you we understand what the Civil Rights was all about yeah how would you answer how the silver rights has been hijacked and how it's being used today yeah oh absolutely so for one they do things like the question was you gotta hit a mic so y'all heard that one again pyaare some people think PR means like public relations I have a different definition of it I got you it's perception and reality write that down I'm giving y'all jewels for the low with that being a case perception and reality they do a very good job of hijacking a thing the all-knower classical liberals were about they was the shooters they was like no forget the crown we doing this American thing that's it they're very good at changing definitions so what you have to do is give the fact of the matter do you know you got to go back right so the civil rights moving in that regard we have to co-opt it there's a way to say black people no different than my Jewish homies right there's a way to say that we have had a unique scenario in America that does not knock anybody else it's just the facts okay what happens is the people that want to dilute that they have to add everything else into it they have you you're almost to say I have black white Spanish Asian whatever type of friends and say yo unfortunately black people kind of like we're endured the Mafia the transatlantic slave trade that is not a knock to my Jewish friends this ain't like the pain Olympics but I'm saying the the Holocaust was better than the African Holika it's not what it is it's recognizing what those horrible things was were so we don't repeat them and recognizing how they hijack things and do that that way how you beat it is the same three-step approach you go I understand that you have had my Irish friends say it all the time oh the Irish were immigrants right bro but you came here willingly it's a fact of the matter now some people were here they came before Columbus look it up Ivan Vance tsardom oh just a quick drop with this being a case you have to make sure that you're fundamentally sound and your knowledge and approach to it while making sure that you're empathetic for other people struggles we have to recondition the world and to stop thinking that people on the right black white whatever do not have empathy or care for the other side especially as a gun owner they tell me I'm just down with death it's wrong okay it's just the right here how much time I got left I have no idea 15 minutes that it's no way I got that much time look go ahead my name is Davis Jackson and I'm an NRA member but what I'm concerned about is children getting guns I mean yeah they see their parents they have their guns they take them to school they get kicked out of school and then at least leads to the school to Prison Pipeline you must do something about that there's so many teens now they're in jail I have a solution yeah I want to hear the solution check it all around the country be sure and then and then the gray market of how they get these guns so wait so here's some of that is just falsehoods again and I'm listening camera people I'm not picking on y'all cuz I'm point you to people with the cameras okay media paints it as if one there's so much death one is enough for me now let me be very clear I don't believe in accidents when it comes to firearms it's called negligent negligence okay when you get a firearm which is your human right as stated in the Second Amendment that Bill of Rights right it's a trifecta declaration independence Constitution Bill of Rights it's the trifecta they go together it's a pyramid okay that Bill of Rights is a list of things enumerated that the government does not give you the government does not grant you the right to defend yourself the government does not grant you the right to express yourself first one I get the freedom of speech I get to say what I said second one is if y'all trippin I get to defend what I just said with a gun okay now those are human rights civil rights kondeh but more human rights okay civil rights are given by government it's why every couple of years every couple of decades black people in America they got a re-up on your Voting Rights fact with empathy don't be mad at me okay now with this being the case since this is a human right with those rights come responsibilities my position is if you are a firearm owner and you are negligent with properly storing your firearm I want you to go all the way to jail do not pass go do not collect $200 okay because every time that negligence happens media makes it look like all gone owners in the room are just the most horrible people you know why most young people this is gonna be very gruesome you know how most babies shoot themselves with firearms and where they shoot themselves in the face do you know why because their little hands their fingers aren't long enough to do it this way so they turn the gun around so their thumbs can grab it and they shoot themselves in the face if you allow your child my child anybody's child because of your negligence I want you to have your due process then I want you to go under the jail okay and doing things like that and making sure that we're educating people about the responsibility of spider-man with great rights powers comes great responsibility same thing so by educating people if anybody want any information on that black guns matters the name of the organization right here and I know I probably got like to set right wrap-ups time to go go ahead take this last one I'm out you gotta make it quick outstanding huh you know who John Henry Clark is anybody here know who John Henry Clark is that's your homework assignment I'm gonna tell you the quote but i'ma answer your question I don't know what you like good don't finish no no bro they lying bro they lying bro I'm listening good all right so wait so wait something because I got a wrap-up how do you tell liberals some are ignorant some are deliberately no you say I respect your right to not have a firearm your choices do not determine mine simple I'm out my name is Martha Raye I took too much of your time please [Applause] [Music] [Music] like ocean leaping and wine stink like rotten time we've got some difficult days are here but it isn't a matter with me now because I've been to the mountaintop and I've seen the promised land [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] and now without further ado please give a warm welcome to former arizona police officer and radio host host brandon and paid off [Music] black the ATL what's going on blessed today gl hey I need everybody to stand to stand on your feet y'all get up when you when I'm in the crowd when I'm when I'm on stage you got to stand on your feet you got to get active I'm everybody in the back to ICU all right I won't try to repeat after me because I think that when we when we do this call and response it's just it just pulls this power out of everybody in the room right I want you to repeat after me I'm free God made me free oh yeah y'all don't even enthusiastic I'm free God made me free I'm free God made me free all right y'all sit down y'all sit down I want to give a special thanks to all the law enforcement people in the room anybody anybody law enforcement let's give another round of applause for the military in the room now we'll try to give yourselves a round of applause for being brave enough in such a liberal City to come out and represent the way y'all represented and I'm bear and I'm very proud it's not and I'm not saying that just for the heck of it it's because I know it's difficult you know when I first came out I said I'm a conservative I woke up I stepped out of the mindset of being a victim people came after me and it took some courage but when I watch somebody like Martin Luther King there ain't ain't very hard to draw courage from that when I see everybody in this room it's not very hard to pull courage from people coming together believing in something and I mean really believing it believing it and letting it be a part of your life so let me tell you a little bit about me how many people know who I am I guess I'm doing something right so I'll tell you you know kind of how I got to this point cuz those of you don't know me you probably wondered how's this dude up on stage you know just like he face ed with tattoos you know a former police officer how did I get to this point where I grew up both of my parents were separated I can't remember a time probably one time in my life that they actually got along my grandmother had my mother when she was 12 years old my daddy didn't really know his father my mama didn't know her father I met that man you know it later in life he lived across the street from my high school and didn't even say didn't have the courage to come and say none to us and so that's kind of the the background that I came from that led me on the path to feel like it was cool to be like my bigger cousins who were just they just had a path to going to jail and doing things that wasn't right and at 8 years old I got arrested for smoking marijuana in a vacant house and 8 years old when I stopped smoking weed and for those of you who know anything about smoking weed we wasn't smoking little joints we were smoking blunts and eight years old and so that that put me on a path but let me tell you this the power of having my father made all the difference let me say that again I'm gonna tell her the power of having my father made the difference the power of a strong black man made the difference because I didn't just go down there and they checked me in and rein me up and walk me out they called mr. Tatem and mr. Taylor main plan and I remember my dad coming into that facility and he said I'm gonna kill him I'm gonna kill him and I remember me and my brothers like I can leave us in here right here cuz this whoopin is about to be out of control but my dad did something that was special because he didn't whoop us you know and I was ready for it I don't believe I was ready for it I thought I was ready for it I was preparing myself for it but while we were in the car we were driving home and I remember him saying this to me he said Brandon if you don't change your ways if you don't act act with integrity you would never amount to nothing you will never be an NBA player because at the time I wanted to be just like Michael Jordan and that stuck to me harder than any whoopin ever could have and it put me on a path to want to be successful in athletics but I still had there's this bad attitude growing up around violence gave me this bad attitude and if you say something wrong to me you got to throw the hands some of y'all know what that mean you got now they say smoke back in the day we should say to peace with a hot pepper but some of y'all know what it is so I used to you know I used to have that attitude and it kind of led me into high school still feeling like I had to defend myself and be that way but one thing that changed is when I went to college I was an all-american football player in high school and I and I went to the University of Arizona it was primarily white and I'll tell you how this has changed my trajectory because I grew up in an all-black neighborhood I went to power lines Dunbar High School in Fort Worth Texas and for those of you know Paul Laurence Dunbar the family blacks black poet I went to that school and it was a bunch of drama there it had some good parts when it comes to athletics but when it comes to drama and people coming off the street in the school fighting you know people putting guns on each other in the parking lot and all I knew was the perspective from the black community and when I went to college I saw something different and I was like ding I don't think white people hate us as much as I thought they did I was expecting people to be calling me the N word and get off the campus you know but it didn't happen and then I realized that it's only two type of people in the world you got real people and you got fake people and they come in all different colors and and I think I'm speaking to a lot of y'all's experiences but the real change that happened in my life is when I found God I'll never forget that day 2008 I went down in Jesus name came up with the Holy Ghost and I was speaking of tongues some of y'all tongue feel people know what I'm talking about I don't want I start preaching up in here but God changed my life I pulled my doggone pants up and started acting like who God had presented me to be from the very beginning and what I always tell young people is that when does an Appletree become an apple tree not when the when the apples are falling off but when it was a seed in the ground it was already great as a seed in the ground and I want young people to realize that a guy had to show that to me that I was great even back in Dunbar High School I was great even back when I was eight years old smoking weed and God had to bring that out of me and it really caused me to stop looking at race and understand that we're all God's children no matter what color you are I don't even matter and then that led me to football didn't work out for me you know I want to go to the league I was I was in the 2010 NFL Draft I didn't get drafted broke my heart I cried like a baby to rip my shirt mad at God how dare you do this to me but then God had another plan for me and I had never thought about being a police officer a day in my life my only experience when I was 8 and they powered us in the car and they called us sardines at the time and we were out mad and we were wrong it's two left shoes but we were still mad at him but I needed an opportunity you know I had a college degree at the time I had a small son and I'm like look I got to put an X on the calendar because football is not yielding results I got a transition to something else I got a mouth to feed and so I applied for everything in the City of Tucson the police department called me back and I mean at first I'll tell you how to phone Carwin so at the time me and my son's mom we had got into a little argument over the phone and then the next morning I get a phone call and they say it's the Tucson Police Department and I'm like [Applause] and I'm like yeah how can I help you and they say well you apply for the job and I'm like ok yeah we can talk now but I knew nothing about policing so I said you know what I got to do a ride-along I need to go see what this is like see if I even like it went and did a ride-along with an officer named Sean Payne the greatest man I met other than my daddy some pain I pulled up on him in the parking lot I say look man I just want to do a ride-along he said come next week we can roll the first time in my life I saw a hero the first time in my life I should think these NFL players and nothing against football players you know you work hard to get to the point your head but I never seen a man that went from changing a flat tire of an elderly woman to save in a young man's life who was attempting to commit suicide I mean we literally went there we got the call and we was going 70 miles per hour down the residence the street ain't never gone that fast in a car did anybody found out about but we were rolling we almost died twice because people don't know how to move to the right and we get to the scene and he's running through the apartment complex and they let me kind of run behind him they kicked the door in and once they got in they let me peek around the corner and the kid was literally cutting his wrists in the back room it's like it right it was kids laying on the ground and having jump over these kids he was on the table cutting his wrists and the craziest part about this is that when we got back into the car my heart was still beating I'm like what just happen to us and he you know he going back to ask me well you know how was your family and I'm like with family I got family you know so you know I just seen how he was and he said look I do this every day I do this all day and I'm like man I have to do what this man is doing I think it's a calling on my life so I became a police officer I did everything I was on a SWAT team I was a field trainer I taught at the academy I did all kind I was a Pio a spokesperson for the police department surprisingly enough and it just made me change my mentality about how policing in America actually happens not what's on the media not what people say not with two or three people I felt at a traffic stop but what's really going on and what I can say is that for them I mean it opened my understanding that these officers are out here risking their lives every doggone day all day when you go to sleep and you dreaming I don't know about 20/20 or something I don't know you dreaming they're out there risking their lives they're out there driving what we call code three lights and sirens they are here seeing the most horrible things that any human person can see have to go home to their family and do it again the next day it just and I'll tell you this there's a minimal amount of room for racism on a police department I'll be the first one to tell you that there some idiots on the police department that's it is that that do your teeth there dentist there it is that's your pastor not y'all pastor because y'all pastors a good tell my two other people down the street but there's idiots everywhere but most people are literally trying to do what's right and let me give you some numbers because a young lady on Houston campus told me the other day she go my biggest fear is being killed by police officers and I'm like Sam we lost man your biggest fear is not heart disease and I've done other stuff and I said young lady do you realize that it's a higher probability probability of you being struck by lightning than being killed unarmed by police officers and if some of you guys don't may not know this number because I looked it up seven people in the United States of America seven black people the United States of America have been shot unarmed and anybody that know anything about law enforcement just because you're unarmed don't mean you're not a deadly threat but just for the sake of argument all of them are bad shootings right I gave it it I said seven of them there's forty million black people in America that number is point zero zero zero zero zero zero one 75% of black communities getting killed unarmed that's like one in every six million people 6 million is 12 times the size of Atlanta and you're telling me that's your biggest fear that is unjustifiable what is the media telling us what are our parents teaching us we should not be F fear of police officers how about you go down there and fill out an application and become a police officer if you fear the police officers so much become one patrol your own community therefore you can dictate how people are treating yo people because that's what I did I signed up and I treat I treated everyone with respect you know I pray for them I respected them I gave them hope when they had no hope and sometimes I gave them hoping I didn't have no hope and that's what and that's what police officers do not all of them but that's what most of them do and I want us to get out of the mentality I believe in what everybody's telling us that somehow were these victims somehow the white man is just looming over us and waiting for us to mess up so you throw us out of a job listen if uh if a man turn you down on a job today you better go down the whole street that job that job that job that job until you get a job nobody owes you nothing you work hard for everything you kid and if somebody ever hand you something any worth having I think we should understand and internalize that because we ain't victims ladies and gentlemen we ain't nobody's victims nobody in the history of the black community from the time we came in on ships so today was a victim they put us in a situation and what do we do we escaped through the Bible I think I think that's almost naked I almost preached on his own the God of the Bible gave us a pathway to be free we used it then we should be using it now if I don't say nothing else I want us to understand that no your position know that each and every person in here you have something that God has put into you that you are supposed to be exercising right you're supposed to be displaying to the world and we will all become better when you find out what that is don't be looking down the street at somebody wonder what they doing why you look in the mirror first what am i doing what can I do to succeed what how am i treating people how when someone a cop pulled me over what am I saying to him first and this is a personal that my dad always told me he said you know teacher would say I did something at the school and whatever because he's like like no I said now daddy she was she the lady she'd be mean to me and I'll he go I don't take care of that lady what did you do because you're going to get that whooping not so tension so I just want us to understand it to two major situations that I want to touch on that I think is being displayed in the media and I don't want you guys to fall victim to the mentality you're jumping on the bandwagon so there's been the situation in the Central Park five how many people know about the Central Park fire and so here here's what I say and I don't know if people don't like what I said I can't help them what I will say is that do your research don't just listen to somebody because they sjw an hour down the street makes where they little black people they are just doing this for money and they got you out here looking like a fool if you look at the situation between the Central Park five and you read what the president supposedly wrote out in the paper he didn't even mention a Central Park Park five in the paper he didn't even mention him not one time some of y'all probably know that who read the who read what he pulled out in the paper didn't mention it one time he didn't mention them kids by name some people try to tell you that they were interviewed they didn't have an adult everybody had an adult present don't watch that movie don't watch that that that documentary was a lot we sit there I looked at the facts and then I watch the documentary in it it made my blood ball they tried to make a scene like these little kids weren't doing nothing they were in the park they brutalized other people which they were charged with and then they all admitted they all admitted to doing some form of harm today young lady to that guy they got killed and if we look at it and we say let's stop getting emotional and look at facts so we can actually defend people that need to be defended I'm gonna give you another scenario what's the right Nereid how many know who Rodney Reed is everybody's out Rodney Reed is innocent Rodney Reed is innocent he may be but did they tell you that he raped three other women did they tell you that he raped the twelve-year-old now they didn't tell you that yeah DNA sample came back after he turned himself in for a drug charge came back he raped three other women wanting kidnap one he raped her near a train track and then he broke into the house of a 12 year old who was by herself and raped her and I don't know how many different directions he bit her blindfolded her or they don't tell you that did they they'd learn to us and I'm cool we're doing an investigation saying hey if that brother didn't kill on the young lady they're accusing them of then she shouldn't be put to death but the forensic evidence showed that his DNA was on her or in her and the reason why the cuz they were in a relationship they try to tell you he and even know the girl so I want us to be mindful of these things it's another situation that came out and then I'm gonna finish it's a young lady Felicity Huffman got into that school conflict or whatever right and then it was a black lady and I forget her name now it was a black lady who they said got sentenced to five years in prison because she sent her kid to another school how many of y'all were in that situation how many of y'all believe that she got five years for send their kids who are alternate school okay y'all smart what am i doing I go sit down but listen it was a lie she had got caught for prostitution and she had played to five years oh because of another offense I'm just stayin fast I'm just stating facts but that's what I'm saying y'all I want us to also understand not only are we not victims but we need to be informed let's not jump on a bandwagon on every situation when the officer does something wrong let's do our research unless because I don't like it when people say all black people are this way I don't like that and we shouldn't say all cops are this way either we should be mindful to take each individual situation do our research do our due diligence and say they do is a piece of crap he should go to jail this dude did not do anything he should be let free and I know because I'm in the crowd of people who are dedicated who love this country can I get a love this country that I know I'm speaking to the choir but I want to thank you guys for coming out I appreciate you listen to what I have to say hopefully there's something I said we're sticking to the horse everybody but I want you to stand up one more time before I get off the stage repeat after me I'm free God made me free I'm free God made me free I'm free God made me free amen thank you guys [Applause] love is a condition so powerful it may be that which pulls the stars in the front of em it may be that which pushes and urges the blood in the veins courage you have that courage to love somebody because you miss everything everything [Music] gentlemen without further ado please give a big welcome to your black Sikh founder and final speaker Candace Owens [Music] absolutely packed in here this is amazing have you guys been enjoying yourselves yeah you're learning a little bit right are you feeling inspired right you know I had this conversation which I kind of wanted to reiterate I was talking to my husband and he put up the perfect love that a great analogy he said the left is like the Titanic I want you to think about that for a second right a bunch of liberals got on board right and said not even God can sink this ship right not even God can sink this ship all in the ocean everybody's it's amazing the media's on their side this ship is amazing it's never gonna go down and then they hit a little iceberg and they said aw it's all right just a little iceberg it's the Titanic not even God can sink the Titanic it's a little iceberg and he likened that to when they when they hit me in the media right oh it's alright we'll get rid of her right she was she was a little loud but we'll get rid of her will smear her we'll say she supports Hitler we'll say she hates herself well say she's a self-hating black it's fine we'll get rid of her it's just a little iceberg but that was just the tip of the iceberg see I was just the tip what was buried beneath was olive blech sit it was 60 years of injustice done to the minority community in America and now they're panicking because they realize you have a problem and you know what they didn't put enough lifeboats on the Titanic they don't really know what's gonna happen to the left anymore but liberals don't know what to think because suddenly black Americans are waking up and ordaining to think for themselves the challenge I have always presented I have never gotten on a stage and told people who to vote for what to vote for why they should vote because I don't consider blex it to be a political organization we're not we are an organization that focuses on free thinking abilities to say what you think in the ability to describe to somebody why you think it's that's the most important part not just thinking something but knowing why you think it why why is such an important question I ask people all the time why do you fight why do you get up why did you show up and come to blex it today what is driving you and the actions that you do day in and day out I know what drives me I tell people all the time the story and it's I'm actually just floor that I get to say it on this stage tonight it's going to be extra special but you know for me running around the nation and speaking on college campuses has been something like a nightmare it's basically just rooms full of toddlers people crying over privileged telling me that they're oppressed when they live in the greatest nation if you live in America today you are the most over privileged people that have ever lived in the face of human history that is the truth okay and so I used to I play this game all right the first thing I do when I get at college campus as I say before we get started because you know I got tons of protesters there usually I have black lives matter in the back just waiting for me to say something at one of it at UCLA they actually had a group of people that were playing Beyonce music music trying to drown out the sound to my voice couldn't be heard you have an Tifa outside making physical threats so I start at the beginning I say before we get started running up yell at each other I'm gonna ask a very simple question in this room okay it's 2019 in America how many college students in this room this is what I asked think that America is a more racist country today than it was in the 1940s 60% of the hands go up 60% why are you were sending their kids to school seriously 60% of the hands off I say you got to be kidding me that is brainwash right there that is meaning a brainwashing at work and what drives me is that because that's what makes me angry so many of you guys have followed me since the beginning since my red pill black days right YouTube when I realized that something was wrong I decided to start a YouTube channel I didn't know where it was gonna go I didn't know that people were gonna find me and start sharing my videos but I knew something was really rotten and I wanted to present a different perspective because what seemed to happen to the black family seemed to be systematic in the 1960s they came around and they started offering welfare right knocking on doors you need some welfare for your family government help let me tell you something the bigger government gets the smaller the individual gets okay government is trying to replace family you have a problem they don't want you to go to God they want you to go to government right we have a solution the experiment was black America he experiments when LBJ created the Great Society Act was black America we're gonna give them a little something just a little bit of something right not much they're not gonna get ahead but it'll keep them coming back it created addicts I call this government addicts addicted to government I don't know anybody who has stayed on welfare and gotten ahead in their life because it wasn't built to help them get ahead of their lives it was built to help them get addicted to government it is a drug okay and they knew what they were doing because here's here's the plan once you break down the family right you know what's gonna happen to the youth when you don't have mom and dad at home around a table telling you what's right and what's wrong where's the youth gonna go they're gonna pursue that paternity somewhere else they're gonna run to the streets suddenly hip-hop artists become mom and dad Beyonce and jay-z become mom and dad right you put on a record and you're learning something right the angry hip-hop writers are telling you how you should live your life and that's what happens and then they seize control of the education system and they started brainwashing because they know the single mom she had to be at work right so it's okay schools free drop off your kid at school the public school system is free fight for the free school system and what happens you end up with a bunch of brain washed children who believe they're victims before they even try to get out they're bitter and they're angry at the world before they even try to attempt to make something of themselves this is a systemic oppression that exists today our education system and the systemic breakdown of family in the nineteen in the 1960s there was a guy named Patrick Moynihan who used to come out with a report in the 1960s he came up with the report on single mothers and he said oh my goodness we have a problem in the black community the single motherhood rate in the 1960s was 23% he said this is an epidemic 23% single motherhood rate in the black community and they all said oh this is an epidemic today as we stand and sit in this room the single motherhood rate in the black community is 74% you want to know why atheism is becoming mainstream why you see people mocking people I mean I was floored to see on the view Joy Behar boo mocking mocking the vice president because he's believes in Jesus Christ right because he said that he doesn't go out to eat with another woman without his wife she was mocking his values it's become mainstream and popular and Curren to mock God why because you have to be the government needs a theism that's what they want they don't want you to believe in anything they don't want you to believe in family they don't want you to believe in God they don't want you to believe in anything but government and that's what we're trying to reverse that's what we have to reverse if we're gonna fix the issues in our community [Applause] I tell people all the time that I was lucky I don't know which way I was gonna end up I was a liberal you guys know I started on the left in the same way but I was fortunate that in my formative years I grew up in my grandfather's house in my grandmother's house and it was you know a little different my grandfather grew up when there was actually real racism in America right not just oh you offended me and my feeling so I'm gonna call you a racist I disagree with you so you're a racist right real racism he grew up in a segregated south his first job was when he was five years old laying tobacco out to dry on a sharecropping farm this is what it was in the south in North Carolina in Fayetteville one of 12 brothers and sisters but he got up every single day and he went to work there was no nonsense he's picked cotton before there was no nonsense he grew up with the real KKK right not I don't like the president so we're gonna say the KKK is back and now [\u00a0__\u00a0] people can't go outside the real KKK and even when he tells us those stories when he tells us the stories of what it was like with the KKK he never sounds like a victim it's exactly how I used to say he used to say my my daddy the KKK used to come around our house and my daddy would grab the shotgun and shoot back at them boys talk about that power there was no victimhood and the amazing thing is he married my grandmother when she was set when she they were 17 years old came up North Mary to my grandmother and never once in their households did my grandfather say anything bad about white people I I wasn't raised to view myself as less than I simply never learned how to be a victim that's the way things were that wasn't the society that I grew up in instead this is a shock amick my grandparents believed in some other stuff really crazy stuff I'll tell you first and foremost they believed in God right faith something bigger than themselves when I was growing up we used to have these big my grandpa's to fix big southern breakfast says I should be overweight you see grits eggs baked pancakes hot chocolate every single morning around the table and we'd have to read from the Bible me and my brothers and sisters we'd have to read from the Bible every single morning he'd go around and he'd ask us questions we were on our best behavior I was a scared because as a child I believed that through my grandfather's praying he had an instant direct line to God and when we would act up he would incorporate us into the prayer and I always tell this story and he might not remember it but one night I was I was cold so I got up in the night and I turned the heat up in our room we had up my sister had bunk beds and you weren't supposed to play with the heat in granddad's house but I played with the heat and couldn't read it but we woke up and it was very hot and I went down for breakfast and and you know I said good morning because if we didn't say good morning he wouldn't serve us our plate you couldn't get food so you sit around everybody else got a plate you couldn't get your food if you didn't say good morning but I was I said good morning I was ready for my plate granddad broke out into prayer and he won't believe what he did he said dear Heavenly Father please help Candace to realize she shouldn't be finishing with the heat I got up from the table and I ran and I started crying and I just said why did you have to tell God thank you between the family yeah but so god that fear that fear right of my grandfather's rules and knowing that there was something bigger that was watching me they had to put me on my best behavior in the end that's what that's what saved me but not in the beginning because when I went to school I was embarrassed about that it wasn't cool to be a person that said oh I just you know we read the Bible this morning you don't say that in school you don't say that in secular America it's not cool to read the Bible in the morning it's not cool to talk about praying and I went down a very liberal route I say this all the time I took the most liberal route to conservatism there ever was I was embarrassed of how faithful my grandparents were all of that embarrassed me but by the grace of God I was saved I really was because those things that felt like freedom going out sneaking out doing what you wanted to do partying drinking right experimenting all of that thing that felt like freedom eventually it started to feel like bondage it started to feel like bondage what is it about liberalism it's so free that you feel you feel like you're being enslaved somehow right you look up and you have nothing you don't believe in family you don't believe in faith because Yolo you're free well what do you have to show for anything if you don't have a family intact my grandfather's a happy story because when he retired him and my grandmother moved back down south to Fayetteville North Carolina where he started and he purchased the property the sharecropping farm that he grew up on that is the American dream right that's the American dream and you're gonna tell me that he grew up in the 1940s in the segregated south and did that and I'm gonna act like I'm oppressed I'm supposed to go outside and act like I'm oppressed nope I'm an over privileged American it's what everybody's suffering from in America we are suffering from peace we don't know what to do with the fact that everything is okay if we just take a deep breath and get to work I was super upset many of you guys know that I got married in August I get to start my own family now and give them the same rules my grandfather gave me and incorporate my children someday children into the prayer and scare them and at my wedding my grandfather was supposed to walk me down the aisle and a couple of days before he had dialysis treatment and he couldn't make it and I was devastated on the day of my wedding so I haven't seen him since my wedding but he's here tonight my grandfather stand up granddaddy you guys be careful before he starts praying and gets it all you guys are gonna be in trouble I still don't put my elbows on the table when I eat I want you to know that granddad I'm good but we thought to end this flexor rally since the movement is really about courage and love and my grandfather couldn't be there and no one has seen it we would play the video from my wedding so my grandfather can see what it was so cue the wedding video [Applause] [Music] we're on this mission in life to find peace with exactly who and what we are to take pride in our thoughts talents and flaws and to stop this incessant worry that we can't be loved as we are by the grace of God my life's mission is complete because of George farmer it will forever be okay that's something that Candace wrote for me and I would say because of Candace farmer they will forever be okay [Music] so Candace without you you've changed my world though you have made me a more generous person more thankful more kind more caring I don't know who I'd be without you to be honest I look at our lives in the last eight months since we met and a look at the things we've done together and there will be the things that most people

die-hard believer in this movement always called myself like I'm AB legs a baby and I know I said a lot of legs are fans out there but I'm gonna go ahead and say I'm the number one fan [Music] I love y'all so I always tell people I voted Democrat I've always been a conservative inside but I was voting for the wrong party I actually remember being in high school when I wrote a paper on George W Bush and my mom was like what is this you know she was like and her face was like disgusted at the time I didn't really question it I just went back and rewrote the paper about Al Gore thinking back for moments like that now I know so so many people are going through what I went through growing up which is kind of like in a way you're being forced you know will grown to vote one way and I feel like we're doing ourselves and our community injustice and it made me mad at first I felt lied to bamboozle that's why I love black you so much because for some people they don't feel like they have a home I can't tell you how people when I started to talk about my conservative values who wrote me privately a I agree with you but they wouldn't say it open so blech see is giving people a home to be able to feel confident comfortable and whatever it is I do believe and notice you're free [Music]", "UmYhmrOSbCE": "the most satanic things about America today is actually Hollywood and this this form of idolatry and believing everything that people like cardi B and LeBron James say it's harming individuals there is no such thing as systemic racism this country affords everybody the same opportunity but you have to want to work hard and you know I talk about this in my book um in the chapter on faith I believe um I talk about how really what's playing Black America it's fear um what comes with freedom you know freedom is almost synonymous with personal responsibility like once you're actually free and there are no barriers and that means that you have to be 100 responsible for yourself you either make it or you break it right and that's a really hard thing for people that are so used to having been oppressed which black Americans were and could point to that oppression and say look we do not have equalities by Americans and that's why we're lagging but what happens suddenly you're given equality right where you just say when I says okay that's it now you're actually given equality it's a tremendous burden and it's really scary", "lBA1Ff-vxC0": "there is actually in this country a hatred toward white people it is undeniable the worst thing that you can be in this country far from what they're telling you I would say two things first and foremost a black child in the womb of its mother that is the most unsafe place for a black child to be the second thing is a white straight male right because they perceive that as being too normal right it's too normal for you to be a white straight male you need to make yourself somehow problematized by saying that you're trans that you're suffering that you're gay that you're Hispanic that you have a biracial mother something people are dying to say that they're anything but being white and again that is the commentary that we offer by wearing these shirts you actually cannot right now today on Tick Tock you cannot use the hashtag White lives matter because they say that it inspires hatred and in fact Banning the hashtag White lives matter is what inspires hatred", "8bADCVYLPJk": "remember remember that when you walk out of here this next person has to become a really great friend of mine his name is Rogan Oh Han Lee and I'm so happy there's so many people that are fighting just so many different fronts of the same war you know I do what I do I'm on stage you know there are people that give money and donate to causes to make sure that we can have a voice there it takes so many people to win a war there are people that are on line making memes to take really complex issues and break it down it's just a funny meme and Rogan Oh Han Lee is one of those people how many people know DC Drano on Instagram yeah actually has a real name it's not DC Drano it's broken Oh Han Lee and I want to show you a video of what he does hey everyone DC Drano here so in my last video of me walk you through Hollywood with Montag a hat I wanted to send a message that we the people of reclaiming our streets from leftist political thugs like aunty fun that video did pretty well but I kept reading in the comments of oh you only walk through Hollywood why don't you try walking through Compton and see what happens [Music] well let's do it today I'm gonna be walking through Compton with my mag a hat I'm not bringing any weapons or any protective gear it's just me my camera and a damn important message that I want to send to mainstream media Hollywood celebrities and these corrupt political leaders without further ado if you I'm sorry guys he's not gonna be here he actually got shot in Compton I'm kidding rogon Oh Hanley also known as DC trade out thank you everybody is that what my voice really sounds like sorry how do you were probably thinking why would you do that you're crazy and you would have a lot in common with my mother but I said mom listen this is your fault like what I said growing up watching you with three kids by herself no college degree working multiple part-time jobs waitressing cleaning toilets cleaning houses she had no choice you know we even lived on welfare for a little bit but watching her do what she did to raise her kids you know I learned that it's not about talking the talk when it's something you believe in or something you have to do it's about walking the walk so that's what I did I took a walk not a walk I would recommend and some people asked you know why did you do it were you just trying to provoke people are you trying to troll the libs kill yourself I don't know I said no it's none of that I wanted to do something that would show just how much I believed in the message that I delivered at the end of that video right so it's not about the walk it was about my speech at the end and I found the safest spot I could in Compton it was like a parking lot and I was strip mall turns out I was wearing the mega hat it was actually a blood territory so got lucky there but I gave a speech at the end I went to Compton City Hall which was symbolic but also right next to a police station and I talked about what I thought Trump was gonna do to be the best president for black Americans in this country since Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves from Democrats back in the 1800s I said his economic policies are going to juice up the economy that he's gonna renegotiate these trade deals and it's gonna bring middle-class jobs back from overseas into America that he's going to reform our prison systems and that he's gonna do more to unify this country along racial lines and Obama ever could and you know what it's only been two years and I've already been proven right [Applause] he signed an executive order that's putting allocating billions of dollars in investments into low-income communities okay we have almost record low food stamps but record high wages record low unemployment for black and Hispanic people and record high optimism the American Dream is being restored right now and we all benefit so the Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Administration guy named dr. ben Carson [Applause] about a week ago I think he said he's gonna put out a policy that is going to say illegal immigrants can no longer live in federal public housing they think it's over 75 thousand homes across this country that illegal immigrants are living in when we have record homelessness in Los Angeles in San Francisco those units are going to be opened up to Americans to black and hispanic americans that deserve them that paid into the system and that are rightfully owed that benefit and i remember when i lived in los angeles who here remembers on hollywood's Trump star on Hollywood Boulevard right lots of battles there there was a moment where there was this homeless woman a black homeless woman do you guys remember this she held up a sign and this group of leftist thugs started beating her up they were kicking her while she was down they threw her card they ripped up her sign they're yelling at her while she was down saying you got what you deserved you spewed hate and you got hate you know what her sign said 20 million illegals in this country and homeless Americans are sleeping on the streets and now that's being changed thank you to dr. ben Carson and honestly I hope she's out there smiling a little bit I hope she heard that story I hope she gets some help but these are historic changes that Obama failed to make in my opinion I think he did it intentionally the illusion of helping but keeping them dependent on government and then rinsing and repeating the cycle every year oh we're gonna be the ones that help you those racist guys though but it's all lie it's all a lie so for those that don't know me I am a lawyer like I lived in Hollywood I went to Northeastern University in Boston pretty liberal somehow got elected president of student government there they knew I was conservative too newspaper did not like me I went to law school at University of Chicago I lived on the south side of Chicago I had the same barber as Obama I'm not even kidding pretty good haircut I got a say but I lived on the south side of Chicago and I could have moved up north and hung out with a lot of my friends but for some reason I just wanted to stay there you know I was two blocks from his house I was four blocks from Louis Farrakhan's house kind of a crazy situation South Side Chicago is very interesting a lot of beautiful culture but a lot of corruption a lot of communism and I remember living in Chicago the good part that the west side was basically a war zone we all know this right and then you would see these parents on TV just grieve struck sobbing begging for help their kid just got killed playing in the park drive-by stray bullet took them out and they're crying and they're begging for help and then Democrats have the nerve to say we're gonna be the ones that help you and nothing gets done I couldn't believe it and that's like what woke me up I was like these people are getting screwed over so I was practicing law in LA doing Entertainment Law I was doing deals with Matt Damon Ben Affleck Harvey Weinstein don't worry don't worry but these people they would get up at their political rallies sorry award shows hello they would point the finger people like you people like me people like my parents who did nothing but work their butts off pay their taxes take care of their families and they would say you white people you conservative people you're the real problem in America you're engaging in a war on women and then they would praise Harvey Weinstein you're destroying this planet and then they go fly home in their private jet you want a racist wall and they go back to their mansion surrounded by a wall give up your guns but let me keep mine in my arm security so I couldn't take it anymore I couldn't take it anymore and I started posting on Instagram a couple years ago and I've got in a little over two years over 500,000 followers just telling the truth because fake news Hollywood they're all lying to us and it's something I want to hopefully inspire other people to do if some random white guy drives a truck and has a beard ken post memes and then ultimately be speaking on a stage for blacks it anything is possible [Applause] what's interesting is that even though they point the finger at people like me the white guy that lives in the South okay it's Florida it's not but to the north that is definitely the south not to Texas I just couldn't take it anymore and so I decided to to move to Florida I visited for a weekend and I put in my notice at my job I had a pretty cushy job I was working really hard getting way too much tax dollars taken out about I think I took home like sixty-two percent of my money so I could pay four dollars and fifty cents a gallon of gas to drive on roads that broke my suspension and then to go home and watch politicians say you're the bad guy we're gonna help the illegal immigrants and we hate you but please continue to give us your tax dollars two days after Hillary got elected an email went around my firm we're gonna be holding a support group for people that are upset about the election adult lawyers needed play-doh and kittens I guarantee they would not have done the same thing if Trump had lost for Trump supporters and so I felt like I was living a double life I was posting these memes and then listening to these people in the hallway just say the worst things possible about Trump and so I said that's it I'm out of here the money isn't worth it on the way out a competitor law firm heard that I was leaving they didn't know why I never told anyone I would get fired on the spot and they said you know can I just meet you for lunch Rogan I was like okay sure and she said what's it gonna take to hire you what would it take for you to come work for me I said well the market rate is honestly like $400,000 that's how senior I was but I think I'm moving to Florida and she says how about this $500,000 and I make you partner she could have said a million but I wasn't going to take it this moment in our country's history is too pivotal to sit back and watch America go off a cliff this is my public service I said we got four years to get this right to protect this president and to save black America from 50 years of tragedy this is our opportunity this is what blex it is all about the time is now it's right now you can't put this off you've taken the first step you're here and I thank all of you and I respect you for that I want you to take the next step after this I want you to stand strong and support this president and support this movement support his policies support his successes because this is our one chance to get this right they aren't gonna let Trump a trump get by again so we need to stand strong and get this done I want to tell you a quick story before I finish I've been doing some college speaking I've talked at Kansas State Colorado University Arizona State all of them like the last three days to be honest it feels like but I was speaking at Towson University which is right outside Baltimore Baltimore has had some really tough times and the speech got interrupted by black lives matter there's about 15 20 people and they start chanting and you know they said why are you anti black and I'm like of all people to call anti black probably not the best choice but I wanted to talk with them a little bit they came in with rage but I came in with love and dialogue and I talked with them and you know we talked about some police brutality issues and I said I'm just curious how many people here think the Democrat Party has actually helped black Americans over the last 40 years not a single one of them raised their hand I was shocked and I said so why are you so mad at me why are you defending them and I could see their brains they just like turn over they're like wait what am i doing but what that showed me is that we have an opportunity we have Candace Owens leading this charge and we have these people open to this solution they are open to it I promise you if black lives matter in Baltimore doesn't support the Democrat Party then nobody really does when it comes down to it so we've got this one chance this is our revolution this is a revolution it's a peaceful revolution it's a revolution that I don't think we've really seen since the 60s 70s and I didn't think that I was gonna say this tonight I kind of went back and forth with it I think Candace Owens is our Martin Luther King [Applause] once in a generation we're so lucky to have her so just know that y'all are part of history right now this is gonna change the country they're gonna write about this in history books so let's get excited let's support President Trump let's support blogs that will support Candace and let's stop talking the talk like the Democrats and let's start walking the walk thank you [Applause]", "7cbSFSCyuYw": "you you may write me down in history with your bitter twisted lies you may chide me in the very dirt but still like dust arise you can shoot me with your words you can cut me with your lives you can kill me with your hatefulness out of the huts of history's shame I rise up from a past rooted in pain I rise a black ocean leaping and wide Welling and swelling leaving behind nights of terror and fear I am the hope

blessing to be here man I'm thankful that I've had the opportunity to come and speak life to y'all my purpose here is to speak life right I'm now here to talk much about politics I'm here to talk about the spirit that's within you where do you want to be who do you see yourself as when you look in the mirror are you relying are you relying or you ain't be smoked or do you want to walk around with your head with your head down which one walk around with somebody handing you something do you want to walk around with power you want to walk around knowing that you run this thing that your future is in your hands nobody else I don't want to hear another excuse about the white man I don't want to hear it what you what you want your community to be is up to you the way you raise your kids is up to you how hard you go on your job is up to you nobody else I learned this thing in life nobody's gonna hand you nothing and if they hand it to you and they worth having you got to fight for it if all of our ancestors your fault they stood strong they weren't they operated with integrity they weren't waiting for somebody to open the doorway they kick the door in and I want us to understand it I want you to feel that because you need to take that from here you can take it out into your regular life you need to take it out into your community and make an impact y'all gonna give it a round of applause I want y'all to feel powerful then I will try to feel powerful I'm tired of that weak energy man its power energy and I'll say this the thing that makes me sick that goes on in our country is the idea that the police are against the people that the police are against the people and I'll say for a third time so you get in your spirit the police are against the people that is the biggest lie that they have told us in centuries let me tell you this growing up some of y'all never believe this I say hell are you saying my pants down here I had gold teeth in my mouth tatted up got my hood on my forearms and then you wonder how did that man come from that dead position with that mentality so now I'm on stage as a former police officer I got to thank God first for it because if it wasn't for me getting saved in 2008 I wouldn't be here but I'll say this when I was growing up I didn't have a positive idea of police in America I didn't every time I got pulled over I liked how they pull them over cuz I'm black they don't they want to see a black man shine they don't want to see me rollin they don't see me rolling on 20's i had 20s at the time some of y'all know what them twenties are but I kept them clean though I kept them clean but they didn't want to see me rollin so they pulled me over for no reason that's what I thought when I was eight years old I got arrested for smoking marijuana in a vacant house and for some of you guys who understand about marijuana we I wasn't just smoking a little bit I was smoking blunts when I was eight my cousin never used to have us smoking blunts we were too young for that so I can't remember that now but but that was my interaction with the police they came and they came in like the SWAT team on us we were in a vacant house they pulled guns on us they put us in the car and I think I was the youngest the oldest was 17 it was six of us well seven of us the seventeen-year-old was a was the seventh one he wants a big boy jail and they took all us to juvie Detention Center all six of us they piled us in a police car in the back and I don't know if you've been in the back of police car but it's small back there all right it's not meant for you to be back there so they put out six of us in there five sitting across one land over the top we were all handcuffed they told us that we look like sardines and they laughed at us and I was I it made me upset right even though I was wrong I was wrong as to left shoes but I was upset that they spoke to me like that so I grew up having a negative thought process in my mind about the police department fast forward to me leaving college former football player I was in the NFL Draft didn't work out I wish it did sometimes but I'm kind of glad I didn't get the concussions and all the injuries that they got but I needed a job never thought about being a cop never did not one time but as a man I understand it I have responsibilities at the time my son was just born he was he wasn't even one yet and I said you know what I'm put my pride aside and I'm gonna apply for every job and I'm gonna go to every job until I get an opportunity I'm not waiting on nobody to give me nothing I'm gonna go fight for it and I tell you what I filled out a lot of applications I got a lot of nose and I had a college degree at the time so one day after an argument with my baby mama y'all pray for me we got you a little man argument over the phone and I'm talking to her and I think we were argued about the engagement ring y'all know about it is some of y'all know what it is we argued about the engagement ring then the next morning I get a phone call from the Tucson Police Department and I say oh man this girl they call the police on me she's trying to get me arrested over an engagement ring and so I answered the phone I'm like how can I help you and they like mr. Tatem you apply for the position to be a police officer correct and I'm like oh yeah we can talk now I'm not going to jail so but that was the beginning I said you know I don't know nothing about policing I know nothing but I know I need an opportunity I said well let me go do a ride-along I've never I don't know nothing at this point but what I see on cops which is a skewed representation of what we really do so I go and do a ride-along I rolled up on this officer officer Sean Payne I'm surprised he didn't put a gun on me at the time he told me he almost did I rolled up on the side of his car in the parking lot and I had at the time I had a Grand Marquis with 22s on it you know I had my hat backwards like that had it up I'm like what's up man he's looking at me crazy but I said look I want to do a ride-along he brought me on white officer so much violet racism huh a white officer brought me in took me on a ride-along and I'll tell you what that changed my life forever I used to believe that football players nothing against them I know how it is to work hard and do your thing I just think football players were heroes oh man Cedric Benson our our Peter Cedric Benson Sean Taylor our Peter Sean Taylor unfortunately their brothers lost their lives they were my favorite football players their heroes until I rode with a real hero Sean Payne we went from helping the elderly lady at a traffic stop change a flat tire nothing major kind of cool good hospitality and then the next car that come out is a suicidal man a young kid it was a young kid actively cutting his wrists we jump in the car we're going about 75 miles per hour down a residential street I had never driven that fast in my life on the residential street on the record just for the record but we're flying and we almost died about three times because people don't know how to move to write so if you see the police move to the right don't get on your phone don't stop don't panic just move to the right you helped us out a little bit so we're going down there fine go through the intersection flying we get to the apartment complex now I had to hang back because they're doing real work they kick the door in once they all went in I was able to come and peek around the corner and look the kid was literally on a back table there was kids laying on the floor I'll never forget this they were like sleep they were laying on the floor and he was at a table cutting his wrists I saw some pain go and save that boy's life this a man that was on the side of road with an elderly woman winning risked his life to save that young man and I remember before we went to that call he was asking me by my family we get back in the car he continues to ask me about my family and my heart is going like this and he said what were you saying about your mom I'm like I got a mama I don't even know that and and and I said hey you do this everyday I'll do this every day every day you are here doing this putting your life on the line leaving everything at home with Anna died for somebody you don't even know and you do this every day I said I got to do this God is already putting in my heart I need to be that guy I need that I need to save and protect as many people as I can with the abilities that I have I let running and training now I can do that to protect other people instead of playing the football playing on a football throw so then I realized that all my life I had no idea what police actually did I had no idea then I became a police officer I was probably the youngest to ever be a public information officer which is a spokesperson for the police department the entire police department it's part 15 black folks on a thousands of person Police Department but out of that I was one of the ones that spoke on behalf of the police department I was on the SWAT team I was a field training officer training new officers as they came in and items a general instructor at the academy I mean I talked people at the academy what they needed to know to become successful police officers all of that I did because I had a vision of what I wanted to see in my community and I knew I had to take the steps forward to be the change I wanted to see and every time I see a police officer most of them are good people don't don't get it don't get it twisted there's some idiots out there right I've had that I was a part of investigations where we fired a few of them because their trash and they have no business with the badge and we stand against them every chance we get we should all be in unison on that one but for the majority of them they're going out and they're risking it all and you see one of them I have a young son I remember when he was just little and I started out I'm all green behind me I'm ready to go but I left him I left him at home all of my dreams and aspirations are left aside to go and serve in the community that was one of the greatest sacrifices that I've ever done and I think we should give law enforcement a round of applause for them doing it every day I'll never forget the amount of people I saved had a young girl trying to jump off of she was trying to jump off a bridge to her death and people that are seriously trying to kill themselves they don't call they're not gonna call they're committed she didn't call people call it in force she was hanging on the edge legs off the edge her fall was gonna be sudden death she's gonna hit the railroad tracks and die she was literally hanging off the edge I was the only person I was the closest person to the scene I had to make a decision I'll never forget pulling up getting out and I had thought to myself I don't want to die but I have to get this girl off the edges of this bridge or she's gonna die I remember going and pulling off the side cannot confirm it or not how hard I did that because I didn't want to fall off the edge but that's just one example of many things that I did I've never seen people who are broken inside opioid crisis saw it firsthand and I'll say this here's a myth that I think people should consider police officers black white green orange nobody like seeing young men shot to death laying in the road nobody follow this rhetoric of these white officers that go into the black community and they just don't care about black folks its allies its lies you're watching TV you're not watching reality when you see all these Chicago shooters who you think respond who do you think showing up who do you think [\u00a0__\u00a0] 15 year old Lynn bleeding to death they have to listen they have to put him in a body bag you don't get to go to the scene as a police officer seeing oh he's dead I'm gonna do an investigation no you will assist in putting them in a body bag you have to investigate you have to go tell the parents of that person that they're never coming back it is a true that's the truth in reality and what police do and I wish that people knew that so we can change our perspective I'll say this the lies of police brutality raise your hand if you believe that police officers killed more unarmed blacks than whites raise your hands just keep your whining raise your hand do you think that they can take even more blacks than whites unarmed oh yeah yeah woke y'all need to get y'all to get the mother people here the end but it's true this year alone they've killed double the amount of whites unarmed in blacks and and people don't want to talk about that but they want to fear monger you think about the unarmed people getting shot this year in total it's a it's a small fraction of the black community where there was one this year and across the country I think there were seven unarmed black people that were shot it's about 40 million black people in this country about 42 million if you include biracial black people that's like point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero something percent of our community that gets shot on all by police but that's the biggest threat to your life it's what they tell you they want you to hate them you get pulled over on a traffic stop how many of y'all been pulled over on traffic stop Oh y'all y'all better slow down let us slow down speed now all day long no y'all wrong how many y'all been doing it committing the violation but didn't get pulled over let me see where this white privilege come in at I'll tell the kid I'm so the kid but when you look at the grand scheme of things 300 million people in this country and there's a select few people that actually get interactions with police and actually have negative interactions with police how many of y'all have had a negative interaction to keep it running I've had a negative interaction I would never forget the officer Tucson Police Department before I became a cop that pulled me over I was wrong and I was going around the speed bumps I didn't want to mess up my 22 so I was going around a speed bumps but he got me I said fine I was wrong I enough of argue with you but did he wanted to go further right he wanted to get in his emotions because he couldn't argue with me and I remember from that I hated him I miss a strong word I went so far as hoping that he got killed I'm gonna tell you the truth he had me out there he was punking me right oh you want to go Jim I could take you to jail I'm not officer I didn't know that my registration being expired in another state is a misdemeanor he arrested me and everything he didn't put me in cuffs you know they paper arrest you I remember hating him but that doesn't mean that I have to treat every officer the same way right think about this think about this for a minute black people I mean I'm saying all people but this is this is a black event black people don't I don't like and I know a lot of us a lot of you will concur yeah I don't like when people judge all of us based on one person's actions right just because some fool want a wire around his pants saggin with a gun don't mean you got to take my gun just because some fool don't value his life so he's decided to take another man's life don't mean that I'm doing that just because a fool want to tell me I'm acting white because I'm getting the education they don't mean we are like that and just because the police officer does something inappropriate don't mean they all like that I believe that's fair but I'll say this I keep saying it that's my that's one thing I'm gonna say this I'm gonna say this I'm like my pastor I'm almost finished I'm almost finished 30 minutes later I'm stealin ain't nuttin because we still at church raise your hand in this your pastor I love miss with y'all I almost forgot what I was gonna say Oh about change and I want to encourage young young brothers apply for the police department right you able-body you can go down there and make a difference in your community they need you they need you and I listen I'm not the one to play the race card but I have been in situations and for whatever reason the way we're conditioned as people when I was going to call with the black people they want to talk to me I'm gonna be honest they want to talk to me they don't want to talk to the white officer they feel connected to me right away and they were still going to jail but they felt like they'd rather go to jail with me unfortunately but that's the way that's the way we feel as a people you identify with somebody you're more likely to them listen to them you're more likely to feel like you can relate to him I mean I'm not gonna lie it should be like the the black people whisper all right I'm gonna keep it 100 I go on the car they yelling at my white friends oh you you pull me over cuz I'm black and I'm like come on bro get over here let's talk you're making us all look bad you know your license was suspended but they listen to me they felt compact they felt that I can relate but I think that it's invaluable for us to be a part of our community's solutions for us to be a part of policing not only because we now have the power to change but because young people can see you you know how many young brothers walked up to me and was like just a black police officer I'm being honest they've never seen that before it's important for us to represent in that manner it's important for us to be a visual representation in our communities because it's just like this and we are on a Police Department we had officers who spoke Spanish and we had a population in Tucson that people were comfortable or either only spoke Spanish they got along with that community much better they think and especially if you grew up in the same environment now you understand culture better it's just the way it is I will go to a house a Hispanic household and another officer who was Hispanic who grew up just like the people that we went over the house they relate it right away and I took the back seat and I'm like okay I'll write the paperwork it seemed like you didn't you know they communicate with you we need to understand that that's reality I'm not saying a white officer couldn't go into a black community I'm not saying a black ops can go in the white community but what I'm saying is that we need to have an opportunity to represent where we where we live we need to let the community feel like we're there you still may get shot you know I mean this is what it is you pull it down you probably shot anyway but we're gonna be there right y'all agree with me raise your hand if you agree we're on it all the time I'm calling her now she's looking at me crazy but let me let me let me talk about something else before they give me the boot so also what I feel is going on that is really killed on our society is the fake outrage in the fake stories of racism all you got to do is look in here that's a wide variety of different people in here we all get along just fine there ain't no situation where the black folks don't feel like they can sit by the white folks and come on y'all that this is 2019 most of us don't care it's all about making money too you know you do what I'm saying you come to my business and you white green orange handicap I don't care I'm gonna serve you just like I serve anybody else and I think most of us understand that but there is a mission in an agenda for people on the Left they can't have us unite they can't have us unite forget party right now forget party I'm talking about ideology people on the Left they can't handle it so they have to conjure up these fake issues justice Millette that NFL football player is just vandalize his own business if we tell how dumb he is Jessie somewhat later he's done he's followed the guys yeah he followed him on Twitter receipts with his name on it I mean he's the easiest criminal to arrest think you know police was licking their chops when they saw how dumb he was well this guy is dumber if that's even possible he steals TVs out of the business vandalized write the n-word Magga he do all this didn't get in the truck right outside the business with the TVs in it with the paint he used and he gets pulled over the cops see him he's suspicious they put him over at gunpoint get him out he got all the materials in his car and if he got black paint on his hands come on bro you can't leave run from the scene you got to get in the car but anyway lies to divide us and I'm gonna finish with this last story because this is the one that I've seen most people being confused on remember Felicity Huffman right you're the celebrity y'all know she is raise your hand so she got off on a pretty easy one we go fraud that she did getting SAT scores I guess raised by paying $15,000 or some big college scheme she did and then it was a lady named Tanya made down so raise your hand if you think that that was an injustice some of y'all woke some of y'all some of y'all for noone likes you right now if you got your hands up you feel to be shocked so the lady Tanya used the she used a person's address but she fraudulently using address so he can go to a better school right supposedly Felicity Huffman guy I think 14 days in prison and she had to serve 15,000 on a fine but Tanya got five years Felicity is white tanya is black I mean y'all think that that was wrong oh you bout to be shocked what they did tell you I feel like I'm preaching right now look a pastor do this what they didn't tell you is that Tanya got arrested in charged with attempting to sell drugs to police and prostitution that's why she got five years her sentence had nothing to do with her sending their kids to the wrong school she got popped with crimes that would have given her a significant amount of time but she did a plea deal they gave her five years I mean y'all shocked region they are lying to us lying so that you can be mad at her so that you can hate him so that you don't talk to him and don't understand that you got more in common than you have in Division so I conclude with that story but what I want to leave you with just real quick is that we need love we should love each other we should appreciate each other and", "JzMCTmpT0lM": "ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage north carolina's native and candidate for lieutenant governor mark robinson [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow look at this crown this is something else all right folks for those of you all have heard me speak in the past not gonna break tradition never gonna break tradition the very first thing i'm gonna do is give thanks to my lord save you jesus christ [Applause] for all the naysayers out there to say this is not a christian nation i got news for you this nation was born and bred by the blood of jesus christ through faithful people who fell down on their knees and asked for his wisdom and ask for his blessing and he heard him and he answered us and he gave us that flag and he gave us all the freedom that goes with it so we give him thanks first and foremost before we say anything [Applause] [Music] also like to thank the folks that invited me to come down thank you very much to blexit all the folks instrumental in getting us down thank you very much for including us including us in this i feel honored to be on stage share the stage of folks like candace owen to nesta sousa and all the other folks that are going to be here thank you very much to blacks for inviting me i certainly certainly appreciate it so guys what am i going to talk about today what i'm going to talk about today is simple and i'm glad i got a good audience out there right now because i'm going to tell you what god has given me a word and told me to give this word and he's told me to give this word specifically to my people and here's what that word is the word is this it is time for us to take our power back we have laid our power down at the feet of leftists who intend on putting us back like joe biden said into change and it's time for us to pick that power back up take it into our hands and be the masters of our own destiny once again anybody who's ever read a history book knows the story of black people in this nation here it is the very first experience for black people coming to this nation was something called the middle passage we were packed into ships like cattle down in the belly of those ships there was no welfare programs in that belly belly of those ships there were no social justice warriors in the belly of those ships there were no joe bidens in kamala harris in the bellies of those ships the only people we had to rely on on in that middle passage in the belly of those ships was ourselves it was up to us to survive in the battle of those ships and here it is we did it we survived that middle passage and why did black people survive the middle passage because black people are a powerful people we are a powerful people we survived that middle passage on our own we didn't need congress to pass some legislation to get through those troubled troubling times we didn't need don lemon and cnn come out and do a commentary [Applause] what we relied on was our strength and our faith and it pulled us through so we survived that middle passage once we got to this nation what we had in store for us wasn't much better we ended up on plantations after that cotton gin was invented slavery became mechanized we ended up on those slave plantations those cotton plantations working in those fields working in those homes and again who was it that we relied on on the slave plantations were no social programs what no welfare checks there was mama there was daddy there was children and even in the midst of the storm we relied on one another and we relied on god almighty and we survived the slave plantations because we understood what was important got off the slave plantation the next trial we had to go through was something called jim crow had to go to separate drinking fountains had to go around to the back of the buildings like some kind of sub human couldn't halfway vote couldn't halfway have a voice everything was separated by race now i want you to look at the way the way what we did in those days no social programs no social directives from the government telling us that this stuff wasn't right who did we have to rely on again during jim crow who is it that black people had to rely on when they were facing extreme racism they were facing the ku klux klan in the black league when the sheriff was an open member of the ku klux klan when you couldn't go down to the local business and get a job because you were the wrong color who do they rely on we relied on each other mama daddy children and god that's who we relied on and through each one of those three stages you look at what happened the middle passage we were at our lowest point we raised ourselves up just a little bit more during that on that slave plantation but during jim crow you can go back and you can look at it and the record will show you that's when black folks were at their highest in this country when the times were the toughest that's when they were highest and why because they knew they had to rely on themselves they held their power and their destiny in their own hands not only did they make a way they set a standard because they relied on each other during those turbulent times the numbers told the story 95 percent of black holmes had a mother father and children when times were at their worst black folks were at their best because they understood what was important they understood their priorities and they stood up for one another they stood up for their homes and they knew that true power doesn't lie with some entity in washington dc or in raleigh or some state capital true power lies in the four walls of your home when you stand up and declare yourself to be a man and to be a woman and to be an american and you take charge of your own life and your own destiny that's exactly what black folks did during that time but see then we reached the point where we had these people i call highfalutin eggheads start telling folks you don't need to rely on god you need to rely on the government see you don't need no man in your house what you need is a welfare check see we're going to start this thing called the war on poverty how many of y'all know that wasn't a war on poverty that was a war on us that was a war on the family in particular the black family that's what that was a war on you see because people like lyndon johnson understood as long as the father was in the home as long as the mother was in the home as long as black folks were determining their own destiny he had nothing on them he couldn't hold power over him he had to figure out a way to worm his way in caused black folks to set their power down at the feet of government and unfortunately that's exactly what happened black folks stopped relying on each other and started relying on an all-powerful government they literally took their power and laid it down at defeat of lyndon johnson and the democratic party and now the proof is in the numbers 75 black households don't have fathers in them if there's ever a cause that anyone should pick up if there's ever an issue that nfl players should be raising hell about if there's ever an issue that lebron james should be saying i'm gonna sit down and i'm not gonna play no more it should be until every black father packs his badge goes back home and says honey i'm here i'm down on my knees be my wife so i can be a father so i can determine the destiny of my people because see it starts in the home you see black folks think that having a millionaire basketball player on the court a millionaire basketball player on the court is a symbol of the success of black people no no no no no no no having millions of fathers return home to their children that's success in america that's success in the home and it is time to stay it is time this day to stand up and declare as black people that i didn't need the government see i didn't need the government on the middle passage what i needed was the good lord i didn't need the government on the slave plantation did they play a role in freeing us absolutely but once they freed us it was up to us to survive nobody didn't come knock on your door and tell you i'm here to make you survive we survived on our own because we knew what was important during jim crow when black folks were shining even in the face of unspeakable racism they knew what was important folks today is no different it is time for black folks in this nation to declare number one if the first thing we need to declare is this i'm not no african-american yeah i said i ain't no african-american grammatically incorrect spiritually right i'm not african-american because here it is [Applause] when we were fighting for our freedom in the civil war we weren't flying no african banners we were flying the star-spangled banner when we were fighting in world war one even as we were still being treated like dogs at home we weren't fighting under no african banner we were flying the star-spangled banner when we were fighting in world war ii still for a country that jaden treated us eagle equal we were fighting under the star-spangled banner and today is no different it's no different when i served in the united states military i served under the star-spangled banner of the united states of america which i pledge allegiance to i have never pledged allegiance to any nation in africa nor do i ever intend to i am [Applause] american and here it is let's make it plain i call myself american because of this my story is as american as george washington and thomas jefferson without the story of my people the story of america is incomplete it can't be told without telling the story of the middle passage it can't be told without telling the story of the slave plantations it can't be told without telling the story of jim crow and it can't be told without telling the victories thereof my story is american i am an american my blood is american my mind is american my heart is american because i am an american and i declare it proudly that's number one and number two here it is much to the dismay of joe biden much to the dismay of all those leftist idiots out there here it is i don't care if you don't like it or not i am a free man a free thinker and i will determine my destiny you will not determine my destiny i will determine my destiny i will decide how i am called and where i go and who i will serve it will be me not anybody else why why all these things true for me here it is because of the most important thing i'm not here to serve man see i'm running for office supposed to be some things that i'm not supposed to say [Applause] but i've been saying them anyway and here's why because i don't care what you think until you hold the keys of heaven and hell in your hands i don't care what you think till you sign my paycheck at the bottom god almighty i don't care what you think cause i'm not here i'm not here to please man matter of fact with when man is angry at me and god is smiling i'm happy [Applause] here it is folks here it is despite what these and i love this word despite what these highfalutin eggheads say there's a right and there's wrong there's good and there's evil netflix just sure proved that [Applause] and there's a heaven and there is a hell and there ain't no gray area or no purgatory in between and the most important decision you will make on this earth it's not how you call yourself by a nation not how you call yourself by a political party not whether or not you'll go to the poll and vote already but whether or not you will spend eternity in heaven with our father or spend eternity in hell with the devil people ask me all the time how in the world do you come up with the things that you say i don't come up with them because i serve a higher authority i get my all my orders explicitly from god and carry them out in his name you see isn't it funny how those of us who believe in him are just seem to have a wisdom and a peace and a confidence in that funny the things that come out of our mouth make sense and then the things that we see coming from the other side are total chaos got folks running around in the streets standing up for criminals got drew brees these nfl players they got a rapist name on their football helmet my question to you is this where were you at when tyshon lee was executed in chicago a nine-year-old child executed for gang revenge where was the nfl when that happened when did colin kaepernick take a knee for the little four-year-old little two-year-old child that was shot in his grand grandfather's arm when did colin kaepernick take a knee for them see we got it all wrong in this country while we're busy putting the police under the microscope we don't let the family fall all the way off the radar we don't need police reform in this nation what we need in this nation is community reform family reform we need a revival in this nation is what we need we need some baby daddies and some baby mamas to begin become husbands become wives return home and start raising their children to be something because here it is you know them folks we mentioned in the middle passage and then folks we mentioned on them slave plantations and then when folks we mentioned during jim crow them folks stood up proud they stood up tall i couldn't even imagine some of them with the slave chains on the rags they had on they made sure those rags were as clean as could be and they stood up and stiffened up their backs and every stripe they took they took it with a determination to survive because they saw me and you in their future they saw what was coming down in the pike and they only knew that it would come if they took those stripes and took those beatings i don't i'm not ashamed of those folks now i'm not angry about those folks i'm proud of them cause their stripes and what they did put me here right now but now we got some folks that's living the dream see see on the edmond pettis bridge with them dogs and water hoses and uh night sticks and tear gas with warping them people upside the head and beating them blooding them up they picked up them american flags they were carrying anyway and kept i don't carry them and wave them because they believed in the promise of that flag they saw lebron james they saw michael jordan they saw all the successful black people who exist today they saw the promise of america but now that we've reached that promise we got folks that have forgotten about all the black folks who carried that flag and bled for that flag and died for that flag and were buried under that flag and now we got them out kneeling on that flag how disgusting black people have survived and thrived more in this place called the united states of america than they have in the place where they came from in africa or any other place on earth it is time for black folks in this country to bend their backs pay homage to those who bled and died for them and gave their lives for them bend over pick up their power return home and determine their own destinies and the destinies of their future generation it is time thank you very much god bless you all god bless the great state of south of north carolina and god bless the united states of america [Music] it's your boy duke mcdaniel the macadamia nut [Music] you know we gotta stay this falling", "Lc9j8Hcowbk": "that's why I call the left drug dealers and and what the drug that they've been selling to the black community as crack cocaine is victimhood and and now they're dependent on

them right we know that by rate white men and Hispanic men are gunned down unarmed at a higher rate than black American men what are the names of them anybody know an Hispanic America or a white American man that's been gunned down on armed by a police officer no why is that why is are they only showing us these moments because it's like Plato's allegory of the cave they are creating a

can I do to make sure that my biracial children have a hard time in this Society right like my favorite thing to say is you can't just say stuff you can't just say words and not be asked to explain yourself so explain to me how that would work why would any person in their right mind want to make a society in which they cannot flourish in right it's foolishness it's to be ignored obviously

comes off better than them I'm from there so I know like if when people like that coming to hood we look at them like they look at you like oh you think you're better than us so becomes like a nerdy

[Music] [Music] [Music] hello hello we have a lot to talk about we have a lot to talk about it is so wonderful to be here you know when we started making this video and I talked about this all the time but it was a conversation that happened between me and a couple of people and I said what happened to black TV when I was growing up this was the vibe what you just saw that was the vibe right it was all about family togetherness I when I was growing up was watching Nick at night there were The Jeffersons there were the Huss tables there were the Winslows it was all about having issues but every night they were having dinner together and the goals were different right they were doctors they were lawyers they had good jobs it was uplifting and at the end of the day it was about family family being the key word what has happened to our concept of family everything that you see when you turn on the television today that is programmed for minorities isn't positive it isn't uplifting it isn't about the family in fact it celebrates the breakdown of family we have Love & Hip Hop now right don't get me wrong I love cardi B right but strippers people that are looking for looking for people to date that's really what we see on TV today there is no positive television and what's actually been the results that's what we're gonna talk about today I'm gonna talk later and I'm gonna give you a longer speech but that is what I want you to focus on is what has been the results of these images that are being perpetuated on the screen what is happening to the black youth what is happening to the history what are their goals today when I was young what I wanted to be was a lawyer right what do these kids want to be when they grow up it's hip-hop helping is it hurting these are the questions we have to ask ourselves I think what's happened to the minority community in general has been a dream that got deferred a dream that has been deferred in our community thanks in large part to the media the media which has played a very sour role in hurting the relationships between all races between white people between black people and between Hispanic people and as a result it has led to in our communities a wilderness you guys please enjoy the show and please enjoy the speakers the great society rests on abundance and liberty for all what happens to a dream deferred does it dry up like A Raisin in the Sun or fester like a sore and then Ron does it stink like rotten meat or crust and sugar over like a syrupy sweet [Music] maybe it just sags like a heavy load or does it explode [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage Baltimore mayoral candidate Pastor Shannon right hello Baltimore how is everybody today this is quite an experience to be here in this place in this room running for office in this city with the numbers and I'll just go through this really quickly sometimes to be able to get the votes you need you have to go to your base you have to go to the middle and you have to try to reach to the left let that marinate for a minute I'm asked all y'all to keep me in prayer for the next 14 months so we made that attempt knowing that God is our armor we accepted an invitation from MSNBC that was definitely not the definition of fun so one of the things that you learned really quickly in doing this is you have to try and stick to your core values and translate it into a language that the left can kind of hear a little bit on the issues and not lose yourself in the process and I'm finding that despite all of the training and all of the politics 101 the best class I should have taken and didn't with circus entertaining and how to walk of tightrope when you decide to run for office they forget to tell you you need to have really good balance to stay on that line so that prayer thing that's real 14 months y'all y'all keep us up in prayer in the city so how many of you listen to hip-hop don't be ashamed not want to see more hands I know you do all right how many of you have heard of Eminem okay one of his songs he says you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow because opportunity comes once in a lifetime this is that opportunity for this city right now we have to send a clear message to the current leadership of this city that our state of public education is not okay we have to send a message that crime and specifically the homicide rate in this city is not okay our crumbling infrastructure resulting in constant and consistent water main breaks closing road closures havens and leaving communities without water is not OK now let me clarify that if we didn't pay taxes to pay the bill to fix those things it would be ok because if you don't pay for it you don't have a right to have an expectation but when you pay taxes to fix these things and when you drive from one side to the other you get to count how many times you lose a hubcap blow out a tire or bend your axle if it's a really big puddle that's not OK in this city decades of failed leadership has allowed this city to fall far from grace for a long time now parts of Charm City are not very charming we need new leadership not new faces with the same old ideas we need new leadership with new ideas that are tried and true and we know work now they say politicians and pastors we have a hard time staying on topic sometimes into time so i'ma do my best so follow me on this for a minute in 2016 I ran for office in this city now should go back a little beyond that my husband and I who's in here somewhere oh he's the cute guy over there with the camera we were living in New Jersey so as many of you will hear they like to use that word carpetbagger to describe me and it's okay I'm gonna I Know Who I am and where I'm from and why I'm here so I don't know about you but I have found in my years God has an interesting sense of humor I don't know if any of you found that out but in 2012 we were happily living in New Jersey and God had put it in our spirit that he needed us to be nomadic for a period of time and to go where he called us to be and you know sometimes when you think you're grown you feel like you can negotiate these things so I said okay God can we just have a few more years here we just got all the kids out it's quiet can can we stay just a little while longer and God sent a hurricane and and we lost power for a few days and it was all good and we're like ooh check it off after the hurricane was the earthquake that was centered down in Virginia and it actually shook and for and cracked the foundation of her home but you know being stubborn knowing better than God I said it's okay we can fix this and God said you're not hearing me so he sent Hurricane sandy and we didn't live near the shore so again we thought we'd be fine well God had a different plan by the time that hurricane was done with us we have been without utilities for three and a half weeks no water no heat no nothing three and a half weeks and I don't know if you all remembered from being down here but after the hurricane we had a snowstorm again no heat no water a little less roof than we had before but that's a minor thing everything we had in our six bedroom five bathroom home where we raised our four children and took care of my mother and my grandmother fit in three pods that's it mementos pictures all that gone God said well I've been telling you you need to go and you're not listening so I guess you hear me now be easy to pack won't it my sister who is one of my best friends lives here in Baltimore and she said well why don't you just come stay with us for a little while regroup and I said okay but I'm not moving I'm just gonna be there for a little while cuz I'm going back home and God said it's alright you say what you want to say two years later still in Baltimore uh we decided well since we're still here trying to figure out what we wanted to do we started a new business ok still hadn't noticed I'm black which means I probably like to cook which I do and I'm pretty doggone good at it so we started a culinary business specifically baking and we were the first minority gourmet baking entity that had a regional contract with 7-eleven and then in 2015 Freddie gray happened and for the first time 7-elevens closed and being a gourmet entity that one of our claims to fame was no preservatives we lost our entire inventory so I said ok I gotta give up I'm just sit here and wait for you to tell me what you want me to do cuz clearly this isn't it one Sunday I was outside who was in my garden and my phone rang and was a very dear friend who since passed by the name of Corrigan Vaughn and he said listen I know you've seen all that's going on down here so I want you to consider doing me a favor I said ok children he said I want you to run for office I said but he said no really I want you to run for office and I said ok so I lost pretty much everything I owned I came down here to regroup started a business lost that now you want me to do this and he said well clearly you have nothing else better to do at the moment dad kind of cleared the path so I told him I'd think about it and for those of you that knew Corrigan he was a very persistent person so he said I'm gonna call you back in a week and he did and he called me back and he said you know what hold on a second now silly me I'm thinking he's getting another call but instead he was making a call to the chairman here in the city so when he came back on he came on with the Chairman and I said okay next thing I know we're going to lunch and there's papers in front of me I'm filling out they say I'm now on the ballot so here you are welcome 2016 was an interesting cycle many of the folks here in this city will tell you that the the spiral and the decline started when the city didn't fully recover from the riots in the 60s 2015 didn't break the city it just continued and kind of sped up that process that it's been in so my grandmother always said if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem so we said okay if we're gonna do this we're gonna do this in a big way so in 2016 we were on the ballot in four areas RNC delegate for a president Truong ran for Vice Chair of the state party and for city council president I went all but the general of the City Council election I share that story with you not so much because of me but because of what determination can do if each one of you in this room put it in your mind that you will be a part of that great and necessary change for this city it will happen and the important thing is and I'm real clear on this it won't happen because of what I do it'll happen because of what he does and what you will stand on one accord with him so when we look at Baltimore today folks there are a lot of issues and I don't have enough time left to list them all but I can tell you this phrase my grandmother used to say what you do when the dark comes out in the light and our president God loved them as shine a light bright enough that you need sunglasses on the inside now there are those here that tend to be you know a little emo and perhaps our president could have used some softer kinder words however truth his truth and all of what he said regarding this city is true so in the course of the comments that the president has made and the response from congressman Cummings and all of that there was a press conference here in the city with shall I say it one of your favorite people al Sharpton huh any fans any fans huh no okay but he did a press conference here and I actually went to that press conference now you can't tell that because I had the good sense to stand really far off to the side but if you're gonna be in a fight keep your friends close and your enemies closer you cannot fight the other side if you don't know where they are so for those of you that only know me from what you see on Facebook we're here let me be very clear number one I'm Christian first I am black and I am on this side of the spectrum now another key factor my husband and I homeschooled our kids and we made sure they each spoke multiple languages we homeschooled all four through high school and I got to tell you when you spend all day and night with your kids and you live with them boy does it strengthen your faith but one of the things that we were really determined was they needed to speak more than one language at least two and preferably three it makes no sense to go to Spain and speak French don't work so for those of you that know me despite what you see understand I cannot be on this side talking to them speaking in this language I have to hold on to my values and my ideals and translate them into a language that will resonate over there but I am still way over there this election cycle for the next fourteen months is going to be the opportunity that comes once in a lifetime to turn this city around now for those of you that live in Baltimore boy oh boy I need to have all of you understand that regardless to where you are you have a voice you have people that are connected to you and you never know what happens today and how it will resonate with the person sitting next to you standing next to you or that you pass on the street so in my line of work as a pastor we call that evangelizing now all of you need to be a voice for this city that's how you whine because there may only be one Baltimore here in Maryland but the problems we have in this city are in all of our cities all of our Baltimore's all over this country and if we can work together to make that difference here we can inspire hope faith and courage to make those changes in all of our cities across this country I don't just want to win my election here I want to inspire someone to put their name on the ballot on the south side of Chicago in South LA down in Atlanta where there is a need we have to be the answer to fill that void that generations of failed leadership has caused I have a time limit and I forgot to look at my watch when I started so I'm hoping someone will tell me when to stop one of the things that this cycle has done for me is it's given me a platform to really be able to speak truth to power with regards to the issues here in the city and do something that in my line of work we have to remind ourselves not to do and that I need to remind all of you not to do and that's called preaching to the choir this room is the choir this is rehearsal service is out there just as those of us in ministry that try to hold others that claim ministry's feet to the fire and we let them know churches and what you do two hours on Sunday what counts is what you do the other six and a half days of the week outside of that building and I must say it does not escape me and I'm sure it doesn't escape anyone in this room that if we had preachers that preached according to the book that they claimed to study and teachers that taught according to a curriculum that made sense and dare I say it parents that understood had a parent we would not be here today it is my goal to move forward each and every day of the next 14 months as if this was a beauty pageant and I was the reigning queen and I'll tell you why when you enter a pageant you have a year and your year you're supposed to be talking about your platform you're supposed to be out there stumping for whatever your issue is now as I said there's a long list issues here in the city but the key central issue is change that makes sense for this city and all of our cities so this next 14 months I'm not going to be just talking about what I plan to do I'm going to be doing now as I have been because one of the things that's been missing is leading by example I can tell you anything I want I could tell you that you sitting right here by time you hit that door you're gonna have wings and a tail and be able to fly home but that doesn't make it so what does is work and dedication and focus and that's what I intend to be about my poor husband who doesn't get a home-cooked meal very often these days that's what he's gonna be about and that's what all of you need to be about because together not one person can change the city because let's the reality is if I win all of City Council is still over the okay I like that thank you thank you for the correction all the City Council's still over there all of the leadership current leadership that represents the city in the state still over there so one person winning is not the answer it's all of us staying in the fight regardless of the election cycle to hold whoever is elected accountable and hold their feet to the fire and make sure they understand we are not asleep we can no longer allow ourselves to be sheep led to slaughter there have been a whole bunch of challenges so far in this cycle and I suspect that there will be a whole bunch more but you know what my mother-in-law says in a very German accent so I'm gonna translate that a little bit what doesn't kill you makes you stronger so I'm pretty doggone strong right now and so are all of you because you are here despite what the mainstream media says you are here despite what may be comfortable at your job or at your school you are here and you are here and despite being in seats right now you all stand for something over the last year I had the opportunity to be a part of dr. Carson's thought leaders roundtable and we talked about ideas and ways and things that were already in place being able to use them and maximize them to be able to actually make a positive change in the cities there are lots of parts and pieces that dr. Carson has made sure in place and we're gonna work to bring that to light this past week many folks didn't think our president would actually come to Baltimore but he did my team has been staying in prayer and because of that not us president Trump spoke at that retreat Thursday Friday morning I was their breakfast speaker Friday afternoon I was invited to stay to hear vice president pence and after that we actually had a conversation about this city and about the things that need to happen now that would not have happened without God and I know that he orders my steps so when you see me and you think I'm going this way and I should be going that way understand I'm listening to him and it may look convoluted but if he says it I'm gonna do it because I've seen what happens when you don't to that end we've decided that it's time to fill the shoes that are set out there on that mantle in that table to be able to take this city in the correct direction so we have put together and when I say we there's a group of us working on this we are actually reaching out to President Trump vice president Pence and Governor Hogan and asking them to declare Baltimore City a state of emergency and there are a couple of quick reasons why better than 90% of our school buildings are unsafe and due to lack of both heating and cooling rodents and unsafe water in addition to 38% of our schools that have students with zero proficiency in math whereas the US as a whole has a homicide rate of 5.3 per thousand the city of Baltimore has a homicide rate of 56 point six and recently because of this Amnesty International the country of Venezuela and three other South American countries have imposed a travel ban on people traveling to this city are you all aware I kid you not google it Amnesty International has issued a travel ban to the city of Baltimore we cannot let that stand and whereas now in this city there are so many food deserts that the city is no longer tracking food deserts and is calling it what they're saying food challenged priority areas and has declared that one in four residents in the city of Baltimore is food challenged now when you get up in the morning to tell you the first most important meal of the day is breakfast so then you send your kids off to school and expect that them to them to have a safe day and actually learn something in this city with so many things being out of antic kilter let's just say to put it nicely it is very difficult for people to go to school for children that go to school and hope to have an education that we won't even talk about the curriculum and Common Core we won't we won't do that but if you're in the building you're still not getting what you need to be getting from that building so we are asking for a joint state of emergency I had the opportunity to speak to some folks in the National recently and they said that when they're deployed when they were active military and deployed overseas they do what they call a block plan to actually not try and fit squares and circles and circles and squares but to actually make a plan for the different blocks and communities and neighborhoods to not just put a cute band-aid on stuff but to actually fix it we need to hold our leadership accountable to fix the problems no more band-aids I'm sure I am pretty much out of time so I wanted to say thank you to you all for taking time out on your Sunday to come out today I wanted to say thank you to my husband for dealing with so much and I wanted to say thank you to Kansas Owens or mrs. farmer Candace I know you listenin thank you for putting Baltimore on your radar and for showing this city some love that it desperately needs thank you all [Music] our next speaker is a wonderful man a man of God great father an author about amazing book helped me introduce David Harris jr. what's up history today nothing like this has ever taken place inside this country before the unity that you all came to this place with in your heart it's something that's unprecedented and can I say that the United States of America will never be the same because of you I'm so thankful for Candace Owens the visionary that she is somebody that said you know what people need to stop talking about the problems and actually do something about it do you guys know there's protestors outside you saw them I was standing right there in the middle of those protestors and you know what the one thing I didn't hear any of them say they weren't talking about any solutions why do protestors never talk about solutions and why do they not want to answer any questions because they don't know the answers so how are we going to get anywhere as a people as a country if we're not willing to listen to one another you guys are willing to listen to one another you guys are some of the most multicultural multifaceted from different backgrounds that I've ever seen in my life and that spans all across the country I speak all across the country I meet so many amazing people and one thing that stands out to me is there left for God I'm so thankful for Shannon and her message today there's a thread that unites every single one of us it's an understanding and an appreciation for God a belief in him and his love for us and the fact that we weren't born in this time and in this era by accident if you don't believe in God then maybe you just think it's an accident that you're here maybe it's just well this is just a time man no you were born for this time for this era for this very hour to be in the United States of America you realize you could have been born anywhere in the world you had the privilege of being born in the greatest country to ever exist at the greatest time you know my first video that what crazy was right after the third debate between Trump and Hillary when I had a couple thousand friends on Facebook I didn't have a Facebook page I didn't know Candace Owens I didn't know Brandon Tatum I didn't know Rob Smith I didn't know Larry Henry King face one down here I didn't know and you know what I wasn't really paying attention too much I had came out in opposition against Barack Hussein Obama I had came out very publicly about that you know the number one reason his stance on abortion [Music] his stance on partial-birth abortion he even voted against the bill that would have given life resuscitation to babies that had survived attempted murder and this man became the President of the United States and what did he do for the black community what'd he do for his own city of Chicago what did he do for Christians and yet America elected him twice and yet there are still people that want to say America's racist are you kidding me how in the world can a country elect a black man as president and yet you still want to say oh the country's racist it doesn't make any sense you got to choose what you're going to believe unfortunately so many people and this is the current state of the Democrat Party and the mainstream media who are working in tandem you got to understand the mainstream media is the propaganda arm of the Democrat Party the exact same way that KKK was the mill the militia arm of the Democrat Party it's the same thing I can always tell what somebody's paying attention to who they're investing their mind in and what they're watching and where they're getting their information from from what kind of stats they want to spout back to me so many people are only listening to one side I listened to CNN I listened to MSNBC because I want to know what the heck they're talking about that so crazy it's always people I'll stir it up talk about all this nonsense it is a non-stop 90 plus percent of the time they are spouting nothing but hatred division doing nothing but trying to stir up emotional responses and Americans especially the black community that don't have their own sound understanding they are manipulating us in order to control us in order to dominate us you know what the KKK is agenda was manipulate dominate and control by any means necessary what does the mainstream media doing manipulate dominate and control the people that's why we call the Democrat plantation it's some plantation of the mind it's one of the hardest things to change a person's mind when they have their mind made up that's control that's why the mainstream media tries so hard and you got to give them credit they're obviously doing a good job because there's a whole lot of people that know a lot of non facts but feel really emotional about about it they think they know oh you can't tell me nothing I was outside and these protesters are spouting off all this nonsense anti blacks at this expletive Candice Owens if this F I'm like you know what I'm just trying to ask you a question do you know that Candice actually said you know what let them come inside let them come inside so I went out there with the intention of saying hey you guys want to come inside and actually listen to what these people have to say how do you think that when they don't even want to hear it they are so emotionally stirred up with no facts that it cuts them off from even being open to hearing the other side you know what that is it's immaturity and yeah I heard somebody say it it's slavery but it's it's a mental slavery but it's an immaturity because grown folks adults even young teenagers can learn to sit and have a dialogue with they don't agree with so they can try to find out what the other person actually means Abraham Lincoln the Republican that freed the slaves said when I began to reason with a man I spend two thirds of my time thinking about what he's trying to say to me I'll tell you this is an issue in communication period and being married for 25 years to my high school sweetheart I could tell you most arguments and disagreements would not take place if the person that was listening was actually listening so many of us I'm guilty too I've done this plenty I had to work real hard to make sure I didn't do this so many of us when we're in a dialogue we're so excited to have something to say in return and we're thinking about what we're gonna say in return that we're not even listening to the person that's a problem but I'll tell you well I think it's a problem period it's definitely a bigger problem for those that think they're right while they're sitting on that plantation mindset they are not willing to listen to anybody else so I got to give it up to you guys how many of you guys in here have shared somebody that's on this stages videos or somebody that's a conservative voice how many think I just shared something see you guys are the army you guys are the real army give yourselves up applause really give yourselves up applause thank you so much you guys are the real army because none of us what would be up here we wouldn't have the voices that we do we wouldn't have the ability to reach other people if you weren't sharing and in the audience and people watching this as well voices like yours are also gonna start to pop up because you know why we can't do this ourselves it's not about us it's about the message and you know what the message is we are in the most pivotal time in our country's history I truly believe that I thought 2016 was the most pivotal and I believe that it was at that time but we're not there now now we have political candidates that want to become the next president of our United States that are openly calling for socialism are you kidding me and they're and they don't get booze I wish they'd got booze I really do they don't get booze they get applauded that tells me that tells me there's a whole lot of people that are misled in our country and how are they gonna hear a message that even plants a seed to change their mind how that's right from you from you from your own voice and from you sharing other voices of truth of knowledge and of impact we've got to do this together we've got to come together as a nation as a country and for my black brothers and sisters out there we've got to come together as a people I want something so amazing on my way to Baltimore today Candace Owens I mean here here's here's what's really taking place in our country our sister queen visionary beat herself Candace Owens was invited by Sean P Diddy Combs to speak at a revolt conference that was all black folks all black folks in Atlanta you know who else was there tea I was there tip was there you know Welles was there Katrina Pierson was there killer Mike was there but for Sean P Diddy Combs to invite Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson to an all-black gathering in Atlanta folks something is shifting and it's because of you and your ability and your desire to share the truth that we share because you share and videos go viral the message goes viral when the message goes crazy people see it for p-diddy to have Candace and Katrina on the stage and it was an hour-and-a-half and Candace held her own and she was in a room full of wolves they were not giving her any love thank God for killer Mike on the stage with her on the panel that actually said hold on a minute y'all need to shut up and let her actually talk and finish what she's trying to say he would say one thing and because he's accepted in the black community it would be received completely different than when Candace said the exact same thing that is truly disgusting a despicable thing for especially our own black community to hate our own black community so much just because of their political affiliations I posted a video yesterday on my Instagram if you're not following me David J Harris jr. Instagram Twitter YouTube Facebook I posted a video of very graphic very very disturbing video I was really upset it was about 8 to 10 black guys in Minneapolis that were teeing off on one white guy any anybody here to see that video disgusting absolutely disgusting to see a gang of people and the guy initially in the beginning was just sitting there next to him it looked like one of them tried to take his phone and when he tried to say that's not gonna happen they all ganged up on him I believe that the reason that that kind of hatred and violence is brewing in the black community is because of what barack obama started when he was in office and the mainstream media continues to push that he's a racist donald trump is not a racist he's disavowed white supremacy he's disavowed white nationalism he's disavowed that David Duke in the KKK I don't know how many times at least over 20 times and can you believe that tea I had the audacity and the ignorance tea I hope you're watching cuz it was really ignorant for him to say that Donald Trump has never disavowed white nationalism or the KKK t.i a very well-respected brother in the hip-hop community out of pure ignorance said to an entire room of black folks and obviously the hundreds of thousands that were gonna watch it later something that is absolutely not true something that if he took his time and actually did his own research and use the little thing called YouTube ti you'd find out that Donald Trump has disavowed them over and over and over and over again what that proves is that he's being mislead just like every single other person that's watching the mainstream media and he's so emotionally wrapped up in thinking that he's right that he's unwilling to even look at any of the positive things that Donald Trump and his administration's done can I tell you something Donald Trump is not a racist you know who was Lyndon Baines Johnson can I tell you what if Lyndon Baines Johnson was in the White House right now as the president and he was passing prison reform which was getting blacks out of prison by the thousands reuniting them with their families I would say that's amazing that's a great thing that he's done if Lyndon Baines Johnson said the white house so we can talk about how we can help the black community I'd say let's go see what we can do you know who else did that Martin Luther King jr. he met with him because he said you know what while I know what you are I also understand the power that you hold and if you are willing to do something they could have a positive impact on my community I'm not gonna cut you off I'm at least gonna go meet with you I'm at least gonna see what you have to say and I'm gonna see if maybe God is using me to get in the position of talking to you to talk some sense into you black folks don't want to do that today why don't black folks want to do that today they're brainwashed and to top it off Donald Trump ain't Linden's Bank Lyndon Baines Johnson Donald Trump has done more for the african-american community the Hispanic community women in this country and America as a whole than any past president that I know of and he's gonna win again in 2020 because we all know that he's the best president that we've had my lifetime he's gonna win at 2020 because he stands for life there's a rumbling I spoke two weeks ago in DC at the Trump Tower dr. Lance wall now he was the first one is anybody in here heard of the Cyrus effect that Trump did they they likened Donald Trump to Cyrus out of Isaiah 45 Lance wall now dr. Lance wall now good personal friend of mine he was the first one to come out and actually make the correlation it was about a year before Trump won the election and said God spoke to him and said Isaiah 45 look at Cyrus he rebuilt the wall how do you guys know the walls going up [Applause] he protected the Jewish community in today's day and age we need to protect the Jewish community and we need to protect the Christian community do you guys understand what's at stake if a Democrat was to win 2020 the emotional turmoil that has reached a boiling it's been boiling over in the mainstream media I've got videos I've got clips of different Main Street of MSNBC CNN ABC NBC Donald Trump's a racist he's a racist he's a white nationalist he he's he's anti this he all these lies they continue to spout about our president do you know what would happen if they Democrat one 20 20 before before cuz I definitely believe a civil war would ensue before that they would target every single person that has supported the president because they're gonna say we're all racists do I look like a racist how can I be racist against myself I love myself God made me beautifully you too the Bible says your beautifully and wonderfully made we should love each other and ourselves and I love myself I am NOT racist against myself and I support the President of the United States Donald J Trump that is the power and the freedom that we have in this country but if a Democrat was to win they are pushing the ball so far down the road of socialism folks that the Americans that understand what's at stake they're not giving up their guns they're not giving them up yeah try it that's exactly what I hear all the time you try to take my guns killer Mike even said that revolt he's like black folks need to be armed so you're telling me that the administration is racist cops and racism if you want my guns are you kidding me and yet all of that is coming from the left all of its coming from the left if a Democrat was to win in 2020 it would be a target on all of us that supported the president and I also believe it be a target on Christians the event I spoke at in DC all Christian gathering three four hundred plus live streamed there is a growing awareness that is uniting the Christian community of the ultimate fate of our nation if if Donald Trump was to not win in 2020 they are waking up they are uniting are you uniting are you woke are you trying to wake up your community are you are you afraid of the backlash of talking to a family member be honest I love that I really love that that's because y'all follow campus and you're part of Lex's that's why you know how many people I asked that to and there they shyly want to say well I try I wish I could wear my hat you want how racist the president is he shared a video of a black man wearing a Mogga trump hat sitting in seat one-eighth first class on the airplane that waited for everybody to get behind this we could turn his hat around and make sure they all saw it all the way home y'all see that video yeah that's my video the president so races he shared my video on his Instagram on his Twitter and his Facebook unfortunately the black community says well he just does that because he's trying to act like he's not so you telling me that every single thing that the prisoner has done that has a positive impact for the black community historic record low unemployment for the black community historic low of a Hispanic unemployment over 50-year low an appointment for women are you kidding me Oh what he just does that because no no no no no eventually they're gonna have to stop making excuses for being so ignorant they're gonna have to stop making excuses because he's gonna keep doing what he's doing which is making America great for all of us he doesn't care your color you know I shared this this might come out in my second book I don't know but I shared this I've met some racist folks I've met racist people you can tell you can feel it even if even if they're trying to be nice to you I had to take my girlfriend my semi-formal prom in high school I'd have my one of my good friends a white guy go to her house and pick her up and bring her to the dance cuz I've her daddy knew she was seeing me she wasn't going I grew up in a predominantly white area most all the black folks there were my cousins I'm serious I have met racist folks I remember one of the first times I don't even know it was racism at first I was on a waterslide I was at the very top I was waiting to go down the slide and I was maybe 12 years old like maybe this tall I sneezed and like a good boy like my mama taught me to you say excuse me as soon as I said excuse me a taller white man looked down at me and said there is no excuse for you I felt that in my heart I didn't know why at first I felt that in my heart like that was just so ugly and uncalled for unnecessary you don't even know me I didn't have anybody with me that backed me up I just had to deal with it later on I told a friend of mine and he said I bet she was racist I said that makes sense I've met some racist folks that's just one I've met some racist folks I've met the President of the United States Donald J Trump three times I have never felt anything but love and respect from that man when he shakes my hand each time I met him I got to shake his hand the last time I got to take a selfie with him I actually got a selfie video I was like I'm not just clipping this I'm a video the whole thing I got a selfie video with the president not one time have I felt any type of ill intent hatred evil which is racism from that man he stepped out of his private life multi-billionaire life to fight for you and for me because just like he told Oprah almost 30 years ago if it gets so bad if it gets so bad that I have to run then I'll run where was t I and all these people call him a racist when they were all going to his parties where was the mainstream media call him a racist when they were talking about how amazing he was the business mogul mr. apprentice mr. universe all the things that he had no they weren't it's when he chose to run on a platform that is against the propaganda arm of the Democrat Party that's when it all happened so I'm thankful for blech sit I'm thankful for you I'm thankful to be alive at this moment and time and history are you thankful to be alive at this moment in time in history you are the ones that have the power to help make sure that Donald J Trump stays elected stays our president gets reelected and continues to give us another four years you are the ones I believe God appointed him chose him but we're the ones that have to put in the work are you ready to put in the work are you ready to put in the work then together we're gonna keep America great David J Harris jr. god bless you [Music] Rocksmith what's going on flex it Baltimore how y'all doing man man oh man it is amazing to see so many happy joyful diverse faces in the crowd that are here to help the black set from the Democratic Party theblakes it from the left now I want to solve with a little story all right so I was on a little holiday over the weekend my husband and I went to go see some friends upstate I got on the Amtrak to come here from New York City when I'm on the Amtrak I run into no other than Donna Brazile right right but no no no nice lady nice lady we got to talking a little bit about politics in about the world and all of that stuff when we were in line and I said well you know Donna I'm heading to an event called the black said you know hated by Candace Owens so I'm gonna told Candace that she said hi and she said I'll do that and she said well what is the black said and I said well Donna de blex it is the black exit from a Democratic Party and she told me that Donna Brazile this is very wise lady very wise very nice she told me well young man politics is about addition in not subtraction and I said yes that is why I'm trying to add more black people to the Republican Party right true story true story and she had a lot of interesting things to say about what the future is but now that I'm in Baltimore I think a lot about Baltimore I came here a couple of times I came here about a month and a half ago for a video that you may have seen that I did for turning-point it was a black conservative meme that had a message to some of the politicians that have continued to fail cities like Baltimore over and over and over again right and I know this because I am from a city like this I am from Akron Ohio so when you take the Amtrak and I'm coming from New York City to Baltimore and you always see you know I always get the window seat I'm always looking out of the window and you see the really great suburbs you see the nicer houses and then the closer you get to the city you know things just start getting a little bit more rundown and things just start getting a little more decrepit and I remember that and I remember when I was coming to Baltimore to do that video I was also working on an op-ed as well because this whole sort of nationwide furor happened when the president said something about you know Baltimore is invested in it's this and it's that and then people were trying to act as if that was a direct attack on the people which it was not because we're not when we say things like that and when we talk about Baltimore or we talk about Akron where I am from or where we talk about Atlanta where we talk about Chicago we are not talking about the amazing people that are from these cities we are not talking about some sort of deficiency with them we are talking about the deficiency with their politicians who continue to let them down over and over and over again so when I did that video I was angry and I don't use a script nobody writes what I say and you know what let me just shut that down right now there is nothing that comes out of Rob Smith's mouth that Rob Smith does not think about or write before he says it all right so let's make that clear so when I got to Baltimore and I did that video and I was saying all of these things this is what I felt I was with a production crew for a perp returning point and they were doing the video we were just walking around some of the neighborhoods of West Baltimore and we were walking around some of the the bombed-out brownstones and we were walking around piles of trash and we were walking around all these different things and for me it just made me angry and it made me think about what my hometown Akron Ohio looks like when I go back because when I walk through Baltimore and I see a place that has been had their people let down by politicians who don't care who only care about money who only care about power of only care about notoriety who only care about being famous when I see that I think about what it looks like when I visit my family in Akron Ohio I'm gonna be back in Ohio in a couple of weeks my grandma there's 85 years old and she is finally retiring finally retiring fully she's done working worked our entire life and I don't get back to Akron Ohio a whole lot but I know when I get back there I will see the places that used to be open the places that I used to go to when I was in high school board it up shut down I see houses where I used to live in or where I used to live in the neighborhoods being foreclosed on I see people that don't really have a lot of hope people that don't really have a lot of motivation people that don't feel like they have control over their lives and that was the energy in the the anger that I took in me when I did that video about Baltimore and when I say things like that like I said we are talking about the politicians we are not talking about the people because the people know that politicians have failed them the people know that it is time for a change and a lot of the people that are blech sitting from the left are realizing that those Powe he's just don't work for us anymore and maybe they never really did you know I get a I call myself America's favorite black gay Republican it's a joke ha ha that's funny um and I get a lot of crap on social media at all times I think somebody I commented on Candace's Instagram today and somebody said Oh black gay Republican gtfo like you know get out of here and I'm like you shouldn't just because this is who I am and I'm a Republican or I'm not on the Left doesn't mean I am insane what is insane is you continuing to vote for the same policies over and over and over again that are getting you absolutely nowhere that's the definition of insanity now when we talk about leftist policies that are destroying cities I'm not just talking about Akron Ohio because that's where I'm from I'm not just talking about Baltimore because that is where you all are and that just what we are right now I'm talking about all of these cities across the country I'm talking about New York City which is where I live right now and if you ask anybody about leftist policies if you ask anybody about the failure that left this policies and lazy politicians bring to City they will have three words for you bill de blasio all right because I have lived in New York City for 11 years I've never seen so much homelessness I have never seen the public school system worse I've never seen so many people that don't feel like they have any options and don't feel like they have a choice so for me giving up the leftist policies and coming over to the right tells me that I have a choice and when I see people from social media that are black or gay or Latino or Asian or whatever any other quote-unquote victim group that was told from time and time again that they are not supposed to be on the right that they are supposed to be safely on the Left when they come to me and they see me making that change it makes them more motivated to make that change as well when they say it makes them motivated to make that change as well right and so when you're out here rocking your blek sagir wearing your Keep America gray capsule wearing your make America great again caps and wearing them proudly know that there are so many other people out there that do not feel or is not as bold as you are they're not as bold as you are to wear your political beliefs on your head or on your chest or blast it outside so tens and thousands of followers on social media and so when I'm at an event like blech said or I do the video for Turning Point USA or I am seeing Candice being amazing or I am being inspired and motivated by David J Harris jr. right what I realize is that all of these people are motivating so many other people and they are motivating that majority to not be so silent anymore and if you see what has happened over the past two years with our president with different policies that are going on with things that are making actual change in people's lives it makes the Charlatans of the left seem that much faker when you have when you have Candace Owens on a panel like David just brought up when you have her on a panel with these fake woke rappers and these fake wannabes in the entertainment industry right when you have her holding her own against these people it's because she knows the truth like I know the truth I have seen I was on Capitol Hill with Candace and David and a lot of and Brandon Tatum I believe lobbying for the first step act for criminal justice reform this is the most comprehensive criminal justice reform that was launched in a generation ninety-one percent of these prisoners that were released under the first-step Act were African American but these were black people so I have seen with my own two eyes policies actually come together to benefit the people so don't center of a panel and tell me that oh there's a white in the White House or they're doing this or they're doing that to try to play on my emotion to try to make me not see what I can see with my own two eyes because I can see it and when you're paying attention you see it you feel the effects of a good economy you see people being released under criminal justice reform you see so many things that are changing in a positive way right now in this country and one of the most positive changes that is happening here on the right on the right side is that I'm seeing looking out in crowds like this and in I'm looking out at crowds like this a lot and I see so many different faces in the faces that I see here are the faces that are going to take America into whatever our next phase is because this is beautiful and Donna Brazile said something else to me today she said Republicans got us out of slavery Democrats got a civil rights but now we have to figure out who's gonna take us to the future and if I had to talk to Donna Brazile right now a lady who I respect for what she has done in this world I do but I would say what you're missing is that the future is happening right now in rooms like this with rooms with people that look like this because there is no way for me that you can claim to be for a change in this society whether you're white black Asian Latino gay straight whatever you cannot claim to be for change and then decide that you're gonna fall asleep or you're gonna resist as soon as somebody gets in the White House that you may not like because if you are for change and you are really about change you make that change happen regardless and that's why work is getting done right now that is why orders are being signed to to help historically black colleges to universities this is why african-american people are being released under criminal justice reform this is why the administration is launching this global initiative to decriminalize homosexuality like these are things that are absolutely happening right now so aside from from all the administration talking I'm not not on there I'm officially on the Letran 2020 train I like to read a lot of books about motivation and I like to read a lot of books about from business leaders from people that are entrepreneurs so people that are really really successful and I was reading a book right on my way upstate and it introduced a really interesting concept to me and and when I tell you about this concept you will realize how adept the left is at manipulating this concept and what it's called is the internal locus of control now if I can explain this correctly it basically just means like this people that are highly motivated in their lives to succeed are in our that way partially because they have an internal locus of control that makes them feel in control of their life so if I feel like I am in control of my life and in control of my decisions I will be more motivated to succeed and one of the case studies in this book is on the the Marines going through the whatever the last thing it is that they do in the Marine base the training you know I'm an army guy so you know I did infantry bases right I can tell you all about that I'm not a Marine but one of the case studies they use is the Marines and they say that what they're trying to do is to not build these soldiers and build these people to just be robots who just take orders they're building these people to make decisions they're building these people to always recognize the fact that they are in control and when I made my change over to the left when I blex I did when I when I moved from from the left to the right when I did all that stuff and I look at leftist policies and I look at let this politicians what I realize is that every single thing that they say that is gonna quote unquote help people is based on removing that motivation and removing that internal locus of control out of their lives student loan debt forgiveness right give up your gone student loan debt forgiveness all of these different things that are designed to put control of your life out of your hands and in the control of the government and when you realize when you really step back and realize how bad that is you realize how smart the left is at pushing that agenda on people this is why we have Millennials and Gen Xers out here pushing socialism this is why because people feel that they are not in control of their own lives and you have to have that feeling that you're in control this is what coming to the right has given me because I was you know look ya'll a lot of people in here may not know who I am a lot of you people like may have been introduced to me over the past year and a half because of Candace Owens or Brandon Tatum on any of these other people but I've been out in these streets for a while trying to find my own voice trying to do media things trying to figure out what I could do like how can I find my voice and when I think back to those times when I was failing and failing and failing and not being successful it was because I was always putting my success and whether or not I would have an opportunity in the hands of someone else and I started winning when I took that control when I found my internal locus of control got motivated and decided that I was gonna do it myself which is what I want for everybody in this country because look guys at the end of the day we're all on the right in here but but at the end of the day it's not about right or or left or or Demme's or Republicans or anything like that we all need for America to succeed because this is the greatest country on Earth right and we have to work together in order to make that happen and when we work together to build an electorate of people when we get together to build a country of people that is engaged that has that internal locus of control that has that motivation to build up their own lives to be better in their own lives then America is better than America is greater and America will stay great you know I think sometimes that we don't talk enough about the effect that the recession had on Millennials in on Jen's ears because what that recession told a lot of people I have a theory that you deal with that recession in two different ways either you think that you know what I'm screwed and I just need a bunch of free stuff from the government so I need the government to repay my soup loans because I made the crazy decision to get some Gender Studies degree right so I need the student government I need the government to pay off my student loans I need free health care from the government I need free free free free free and they're not worried about paying taxes because they're not out here building anything so they're certainly not out here really even worrying about working right and so you had one of two types of you have two types of people that came from that recession you have people that want everything and people that realize that you have to build create and work for everything that you have and what I want to do right now to wrap this up is I want to say that I blex it it I have made my decision to come to the right my life has gotten better when I started to embrace the core of these lessons that I've learned over the past couple of years and even though some people are very very on the wrong path this will not be a socialist country but if we make sure that we engage everybody that we engage the people in our back yards that we engage the people in our communities that we engage the people around us to love this amazing country that we live in to motivate them to know that they can build they can succeed and they can achieve then we will do our part to keep this country great and we will keep on making it great and that starts with our communities because change does not start from the top down I'm telling you it starts from the bottom up it starts from rooms like this it starts at your workplaces it started such a churches it starts anywhere where you can make that change and I thank you so much for being a part of this change today thank you [Music] ladies and gentlemen please enjoy a brief minute intermission the show will continue in 15 minutes be sure

thankful that I've had the opportunity to come and speak life to y'all my purpose here does it speak life right I'm not here to talk much about politics I'm here to talk about the spirit that's within you where do you want to be who do you see yourself as when you look in the mirror are you relying are you relying or you ain't be smoke or do you want to walk around with your head with your head down what you want to walk around with somebody handing you something do you want to walk around with power you want to walk around knowing that you run this thing that your future is in your hands nobody else I don't want to hear another excuse about the white man I don't want to hear it what you what you want your community to be it's up to you the way you raise your kids is up to you how hard you call your job is up to you nobody else I learned this thing in life nobody's gonna hand you nothing and if they hand it to you any worth having you gotta fight for it if all of our ancestors have fought they stood strong they weren't they operated with integrity they weren't waiting for somebody to open the doorway they kick the door in and I want us to understand it I want you to feel that because you need to take that from here you need to take it out into your regular life you need to take it out into your community and make an impact y'all gonna give it a round of applause I want to try to feel powerful then I will try to feel powerful I'm tired of that weak energy man its power energy and I'll say this the thing that makes me sick that goes on in our country is the idea that the police or against the people that the police are against the people and I say for a third time so you get in your spirit the police are against the people that is the biggest lie that they have told us in centuries let me tell you this growing up some of y'all would never believe this I used to hell are you saying my plans down here I had gold teeth in my mouth chatted up got my hood on my forearms now you wonder hide at that man come from that dead position with that mentality so now I'm on stage as a former police officer I got to thank God first for it because if it wasn't for me getting saved in 2008 I wouldn't be here but I'll say this when I was growing up I didn't have a positive idea of police in America I didn't every time I got pulled over I like are they pulling over cuz I'm black they don't they don't want to see a black man shine they don't want to see me rollin they don't see me rolling on 20's i had 20s at the time some of y'all know what them twenties are but I kept them clean though I kept them clean but they didn't want to see me rollin so they pulled me over for no reason that's what I thought when I was 8 years old I got arrested for smoking marijuana in a vacant house and for some of you guys who understand about marijuana we I wasn't just smoking a little bit I was smoking blunts when I was 8 my cousin then they used to have us smoking blunts we were too young for that so I can't remember that now but but that was my interaction with the police they came and they they came in like the SWAT team on us we were in a vacant house they pulled guns on us they put us in the car and I think I was the youngest the oldest was 17 it was six of us well seven of us the seventeen-year-old was a said was the seventh one he wants a big boy jail and they took all us to juvie Detention Center all six of us they piled us in a police car in the back and I don't know if you've been in the back of police car but it's small back there all right it's not meant for you to be back there so they put out six of us in there five sitting across one land over the top we were all handcuffed they told us that we look like sardines and they laughed at us and I was I it made me upset right even though I was wrong I was wrong as to left shoes but I was upset that they spoke to me like that so I grew up having a negative thought process in my mind about the police department fast forward to me leaving college former football player I was in the NFL Draft didn't work out I wish it did sometimes but I'm kind of glad I didn't get the concussions and all the injuries that they got but I needed a job never thought about being a cop never did not one time but as a man I understand it I have responsibilities at the time my son was just born he was he wasn't even one yet and I said you know what I'm put my pride aside and I'm gonna apply for every job and I'm gonna go to every job until I get an opportunity I'm not waiting on nobody to give me nothing I'm gonna go fight for it and I tell you what I filled out a lot of applications I got a lot of nose and I had a college degree at the time so one day after an argument with my baby mama y'all pray for me we got you a little mind argument over the phone and I'm talking to her and I think we were argued about the engagement ring y'all know about it is some of y'all know what it is we argued about the engagement ring then the next morning I get a phone call from the Tucson Police Department and I say oh man this girl they call the police on me she's trying to get me arrested over an engagement ring and so I answered the phone I'm like how can I help you and they like mr. Tatem you apply for the position to be a police officer correct and I'm like oh yeah we can talk now I'm not going to jail so but that was the beginning I said you know I don't know nothing about policing I know nothing but I know I need an opportunity I said well let me go do a ride-along I've never I don't know nothing at this point but what I see on which is a skewed representation of what we really do so I go and do a ride-along I roll up on this officer officer Sean pain I'm surprised he didn't pull the gun on me at the time he told me he almost did I rolled up on the side of this car in the parking lot and I had at the time I had a Grand Marquis with 22s on it you know I had my hat backwards like that add it up I'm like what's up man he's looking at me crazy but I said look I want to do a ride-along he brought me on white officer so much violet racism huh a white officer brought me in took me on a ride-along and I'll tell you what that changed my life forever I used to believe that football players nothing against them I know how it is to work hard and do your thing I just think football players were heroes oh man Cedric Benson our our Peter Cedric Benson Sean Taylor our Peter son Taylor unfortunately their brothers lost their lives they were my favorite football players they're heroes until I rode with a real hero Shawn Payne we went from helping the elderly lady at a traffic stop change a flat tire nothing major kind of cool good hospitality and then the next car that come out is a suicidal man a young kid it was a young kid actively cutting his wrists we jump in the car we're going about 75 miles per hour down a residential street I had never driven that fast in my life on the residential street on the record just for the record but we're flying and we almost died about three times because people don't know how to move to write so if you see the police move to the right don't get on your phone don't stop don't panic just move to the right you helped us out a little bit so we're going down there fine go through the intersection flying we get to the apartment complex now I had to hang back because they're doing real work they kicked the door in once they all went in I was able to come and peek around the corner and look the kid was literally on a back table there was kids laying on the floor I'll never forget this they were like sleep they were laying on the floor and he was at a table cutting his wrists I saw some pain go and save that boy's life the same man that was on the side of road with the elderly woman women risked his life to save that young man and I remember before we went to that call he was asking me about my family we get back in the car he continues to ask me about my family and my heart is going like this and he said what were you said about your mom I'm like I got a mama I don't even know that and and and I said hey you do this every day I'll do this every day every day you are here doing this putting your life on the line leaving everything at home within the die for somebody you don't even know and you do this every day I said I got to do this God is already putting in my heart I need to be that guy I need that I need to save and protect as many people as I can with the abilities that I have our letting running and training now I can do that to protect other people instead of playing the football playing on a football throw so then I realized that all my life I had no idea what police actually did I had no idea then I became a police officer I was part of the youngest to ever be a public information officer which is a spokesperson for the police department the entire police department its price fifteen black folks on thousands of person police department but out of that I was one of the ones that spoke on behalf of the police department I was on the SWAT team I was a field training officer training new officers as they came in and items a general instructor at the academy mean I talked people at the academy what they needed to know to become successful police officers all of that I did because I had a vision of what I wanted to see in my community and I knew I had to take the steps forward to be the change I wanted to see and every time I see a police officer most of them are good people don't don't get it don't get it twisted there's some idiots out there right I've had that I was a part of investigations where we fired a few of them because their trash and they have no business with the badge and we stand against them every chance we get we should all be in unison on that one but for the majority of them they're going out and they're risking it all and you see one of them I have a young son I remember when he was just little and I started out I'm all green behind it I'm ready to go but I left him I left him at home all of my dreams and aspirations are left aside to go and serve in the community that was one of the greatest sacrifices that I've ever done and I think we should give law enforcement a round of applause for them doing it every day I'll never forget the amount of people I saved had a young girl trying to jump off of she was trying to jump off a bridge to her death and people that are seriously trying to kill themselves they don't call they're not gonna call they're committed she didn't call people called nforce she was hanging on the edge legs off the edge her fall was gonna be sudden death she's gonna hit the railroad tracks and die she was literally hanging off the edge I was the only person I was the closest person to the scene I had to make a decision I'll never forget pulling up getting out and I had thought to myself I don't want to die but I have to get this girl off the edge of this of this bridge or she's gonna die I remember going and pulling her off the side cannot confirm it or not how hard I did that because I didn't want to fall off the edge but that's just one example of many things that I did I've never seen people who are broken inside opioid crisis saw it firsthand and I'll say this here's a myth that I think people should consider police officers black white green orange nobody likes seeing young men shot to death laying in the road nobody for all this rhetoric of these white officers that go into the black community and they just don't care about black folks its allies it's lies you're watching TV you're not watching reality when you see all these Chicago shooters who you think respond who do you think showing up who do you think 15 year old Lynn bleeding to death they have to listen they have to put him in a body bag you don't get to go to the scene as a police officer serious oh he's dead I'm gonna do an investigation no you assist in putting them in a body bag you have to investigate you have to go tell the parents of that person that they're never coming back and is a true that's the truth in reality and what police do and I wish that people knew that so we can change our perspective I'm say this the lies of police brutality raise your hand if you believe that police officers killed more unarmed blacks and whites raise your hands just keep your whining raise your hand dee do you think that they can take even more blacks than whites unarmed well y'all see ya woke y'all need to get y'all to get them other people in here the end but it's true this year alone they killed double the amount of whites unarmed in blacks and and people don't want to talk about that but they want to fear monger you think about unarmed people getting shot this year in total it's a it's a small fraction of the black community involvement was won this year and across the country I think there were seven unarmed black people that were shot there's about 40 million black people in this country about 42 million if you include biracial black people that's like point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero something percent of our community that gets shot on on by police but that's the biggest threat to your life is what they tell you they want you to hate them you get pulled up on a traffic stop how many of y'all been pulled over on traffic stop Oh y'all y'all better slow down let us slow down speed now all day long no y'all wrong how many y'all been doing it committing a violation but didn't get pulled over let me see where there's white privilege come in it I'll tell the kid I'm so the kid but when you look at the grand scheme of things 300 million people in this country and there's a select few people that actually get interactions with police and actually have negative interactions with police how many of y'all have had a negative interaction keep it 1 on it I've had a negative interaction I would never forget the officer Tucson Police Department before I became a cop that pulled me over I was wrong and I was going around the speed bumps I didn't want to mess up my 22s I was going around a speed box but he got me I said fine I was wrong I never argue with you but did he wanted to go further right he wanted to get in his emotions because he couldn't argue with me and I remember from that I hated him as a strong word I went so far as hoping that he got killed I'm gonna tell you the truth he get me out there he was punking me right oh you want to go to jail I could take you to jail I'm not officer I didn't know that my registration being expired in another state is a misdemeanor he arrested me and everything he didn't put me in cuffs you know they paper arrest you I remember hating him but that doesn't mean that I have to treat every officer the same way right think about this think about this for a minute black people I mean I'm saying all people but this is this is a black event black people don't I don't like and I know a lot of us a lot of you will concur yeah I don't like when people judge all of us based on one person's actions right just because some fool want a wire around his pants saggin with a gun don't mean you got to take my gun just because some fool don't value his life so he's decide to take another man's life don't mean that I'm doing that just because a fool want to tell me I'm acting white because I'm getting the education they don't mean we are like that and just because the police officer does something inappropriate don't mean they all like that I believe that's fair but I'll say this I keep saying it that's mine that's one thing I'm gonna say this I'm gonna say this I'm like my pastor I'm almost finished I'm almost finished 30 minutes later I'm stealin ain't nuttin because we still at church raise your hand at this your pastor I love miss with y'all I almost forgot what I was gonna say Oh about change and I want to encourage young young brothers apply for the police department right you able-body you can go down there and make a difference in your community they need you they need you and I listen I'm not the one to play the race card but I have been in situations and for whatever reason the way we're conditioned as people when I was going to call with the black people they want to talk to me I'm gonna be honest they want to talk to me they don't want to talk to the white officer they feel connected to me right away and they were still going to jail but they felt like they'd rather go to jail with me unfortunately but that's the way that's the way we feel as a people you identify with somebody you're more likely to listen to them you're more likely to feel like you can relate to him I mean I'm not gonna lie you should be like the the black people whisper all right I'm gonna keep it 100 I go on the car they yelling at my white friends oh you you pull me over cuz I'm black and I'm like come on bro get over here let's talk you're making us all look bad you know your license was suspended but they listen to me they felt compact they felt that I can relate I mean I think that it's invaluable for us to be a part of our communities solutions for us to be a part of policing not only because we now have the power to change but because young people can see you you know how many young brothers walked up to me and was like just a black police officer I'm being honest they never seen that before it's important for us to represent in that manner it's important for us to be a visual representation in our communities because it's just like this and we on a Police Department we had officers who spoke Spanish and we had a population in Tucson that people were comfortable or either only spoke Spanish they got along with that community much better they big and especially if you grew up in the same environment now you understand culture better it's just the way it is I will go to a house a Hispanic household and another officer who was Hispanic who grew up just like the people that we went over the house they relate it right away and I took the back seat and I'm like okay I'll write the paperwork it seemed like you didn't you know they communicate with you we need to understand that that's reality I'm not saying a white officer couldn't go into a black community I'm not saying a black ops can go in a white community but what I'm saying is that we need to have an opportunity to represent where we where we live we need to let the community feel like we're there you still may get shot you know I mean this is what it is you pull it down you probably shot anyway but we're gonna be there right y'all agree with me raise your hand if you agree we're I met on the time I'm calling her now she's looking at me crazy but let me let me let me talk about something else before they give me the boot so also what I feel is going on that is really killed on our society is the fake outrage in the fake stories of racism all you gotta do is look in here that's a wide variety of different people in here we all get along just fine there ain't no situation where the black folks don't feel like they can sit by the white folks and that come on y'all that this is 2019 most of us don't care it's all about making money too you know you do what I'm saying you come to my business and you white green orange handicap I don't care I'm gonna serve you just like I serve anybody else and I think most of us understand that but there is a mission in an agenda for people on the Left they can't have us unite they can't have us unite forget party right now forget party I'm talking about ideology people on the Left they can't handle it so they have to conjure up these fake issues justice Millette that NFL football player they just vandalized his own business let me tell you how dumb he is Jesse Sommelier he's dumb he's followed the guys y'all know he followed him on Twitter receipts with his name on I mean he's the easiest criminal to rest think you know police was licking their chops when they saw how dumb he was well this guy is dumber if that's even possible he steals TVs out of the business vandalized right the n-word Magga he do all this then he get in the truck right outside the business with the TVs in it with the paint he used and he gets pulled over the cops see him he's suspicious they put him over at gunpoint get him out he got all the materials in his car and he got black paint on his hands come on bro you can't leave run from the scene you got to get in the car Joe but anyway lies to divide us and I'm gonna finish with this last story because this is the one that I've seen most people being confused on remember Felicity Huffman right you're the celebrity y'all know what she is raise your hand so she got off on a pretty easy one big old fraud that she did getting SAT scores I guess raised by paying $15,000 or some big college scheme she did and then it was a lady named Tanya me down so raise your hand if you think that that was an injustice some of y'all woke some of y'all some of y'all finna in likes you right now if you got your hands up you feel to be shocked so the lady Tanya use the she used the person's address but she fraudulently use an address so he can go to a better school right supposedly Felicity Huffman guy I think 14 days in prison and she had to serve 50,000 on a fine but Tanya got five years Felicity is white Tanya is black I mean y'all think that that was wrong oh you bout to be shocked what they did tell you I feel like I'm preaching right now dr. pastor do this what they didn't tell you is that Tanya got arrested in charged with attempting to sell drugs to police and prostitution that's why she got five years her sentence had nothing to do with her sitting there key to the wrong school she got popped with crimes that would have given her a significant amount of time but she did a plea deal they gave her five years I mean y'all shocked region they are lying to us lying so that you can be mad at her so that you can hate him so that you don't talk to him and don't understand that you got more in common than you have in division so I conclude with that story but what I want to leave you with just real quick is that we need love we should love each other we should appreciate each other and we have to understand that it ain't just black people got to do this alone we need our brothers and sisters from the other side our own say the other side we on the same team but we got to work together we were not supposed to go at it alone because we're all in this together think about the history of slavery Harriet Tubman in today by herself she went creeping awhile and some white folks kept her out gave her house to transport the slaves because they believed that it was wrong the whole time you were free in the north we've always worked together to succeed and I want you guys to remember that but next up is a wonderful brother I call him my brother even though we differ colors same God though I know y'all here they're the same God though but this gentleman goes all around the country insightful content interviews I think y'all know who he is help me give a great welcome to will wit allow me goes this is will wit with Prager you today we're at UCLA talking to college students and on Olvera Street talking to Hispanics in honor of Halloween and to see if my outfit is offensive would you guys like to chat with us today that's why we want to talk to you about a la find my outfit offensive you find anything do you find it offensive maybe a little do you think my outfit is offensive are you Mexican no yes I think it reaffirms stereotypes that are offensive to people you think people really think Mexican people are like this and carry around watches actually think do you find my outfit offensive yes yeah why it's not your culture cultural preparation why do you say that Mexican food is like cultural appropriation no someone else's culture that we've kind of taken is this cultural appropriation you don't really understand what their culture means and what it means to wear these things like the hats and the maracas you know you sort of have to understand where all of this comes from for it to not be cultural appropriation it's not yours [Music] you can I just ask you do you like my costume I like you your message monthly this is my outfit offends you thank you do you like my costume yes does it offend you no no not me whap oh are you guys insulting me salting me in Spanish do you like them do you like my outfit is my outfit offend you no some people get offended by what I'm wearing no no original do you know who sold me this no Mexicans really so you're white and you get offended but then Mexican people who sold me this and maybe this don't get offended seems kind of weird doesn't it I love it actually I think it's offensive no some people get really offended by this why do you think that is I don't know just you're not Mexican so people think that you have to be Mexican to wear that celebrating Mexico yeah that's awesome a Mexican I am see maybe we should swap out ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage will whit [Music] thank you thank you gracias gracias that's what I should be saying I haven't done one of these events in a while and so I have to start it out we're just letting you guys know again I am NOT black okay we are putting we are putting the rumors to rest I have to do it every single time I do one of these events but just want to say first of all thank you to all of you guys for being here and for standing up for the values you believe in that's that's incredible that's incredible so all of those Mexicans that you saw in that video to the left are basically token Mexicans right that's what the left would call them they all have internalized racism right the stupidest thing that I've ever heard I did a video where I went to California State University Northridge many Californians in here X count look perfect there you go well I don't know if Baltimore is that much better but I did a video where I went I wore a Native American headdress and a friend of mine Mike he was the black pilgrim he dressed up as a pilgrim and then we went out there for Thanksgiving and we were giving out pumpkin pie to people right and whenever you go to a school in California things never go as planned and so we started getting verbally harassed we got death threats and then eventually they ended up kicking us off campus saying how offended they were how terrible and racist I was and the black pilgrim for wearing this and then they ripped off my costume and we left there's a very intense moment I'll have to say but after seeing this I was like okay I'm gonna I want to put this to the test and so I went I drove 900 miles to the Navajo Indian Reservation in Window Rock Arizona and I went I asked them what they thought about the costume and what they thought about these issues and not one of them was offended by the Washington Redskins name not one of them was offended by cultural appropriation and not one of them wanted other people to get offended for them on their behalf it is cultural appreciation not appropriation okay that's right but as you guys know if you're in college or you have kids who go to college your kids are going to college and they're coming out stupider than when they went in and that's the truth I was just there okay that's why I left people are not born offended okay if you get offended by me showing up on your campus and a sombrero and a mustache you have to be at a university okay these things are not natural you don't naturally wake up being offended this is something that has to be taught and it's because these these college students are so young and impressionable and they've never heard a different point of view they go to college and their virtue signaling academics are teaching them how terrible America is how horrible white people are and that my culture is not your damn prom dress right these are the issues that college professors teach students are going in and getting useless degrees they can't find jobs and then they come out getting offended by some white guy in a sombrero it's ridiculous so what does all this mean all these white leftists getting offended it really means the white leftists are the most racist people in America and I'm white I can say that okay can talk about my culture they think that their virtue signaling antics are helping minorities when reality it undermines them I don't know if you guys ever saw the video that ami Horowitz did I'm working with him right now actually on a documentary about how much California sucks but different story but ami did a video where he went around and talked to people you know a bunch of leftist and he asked them you know about voter ID laws and they said yeah well if they're racist because black people can't get an ID right this is what these people were saying and then he went out into the hood and he asked black people about their ideas and they're like of course they have an ID like what are you talking about you know it's like this virtue signaling this pandering that leftist want to talk about when they're talking about minorities but it's like they don't even understand the communities or the people that they're talking to it's insane it's instil of ignorance that they go off is it's maddening because they're all over everything Hollywood the media your university they're everywhere but everything that they say is wrong I like I'm saying these leftists have been completely duping people and completely brainwashed every one a university and all young people in America and so it's I think that everyone is born a conservative though everyone has to be born a conservative and then you're taught to be a leftist so a few months ago I was in a Oberer right and I was in a suit I was in LA mind you and my uber driver she's a Hispanic woman and she's like oh like you look nice like what do you do I'm like oh I'm like a political personality you know I make political videos she's like oh my god that's so great that we have someone getting Trump out of office thank you I'm just like yeah dude for sure you know I don't usually talk politics with uber drivers about these kind of things because they find out how much from supporter and one wrong turn it's a one less of us out there but I ended up talking to her I was interested in I was going to a speech you know for motivation and things like that and it ended up that she was against affirmative action she was against the welfare state she believed in fathers in the homes and she was a schoolteacher when she was in her bird reiver and she was against putting transgender bathrooms into her school it was like all these ideas that she talked about we're conservative ideals we're conservative views but she hated Donald Trump and Republicans and she thought we were evil people right is that not just so insane I'm telling you that most people when you get down to it and you don't if you don't mention Trump's name in the the issues and the politics that you're talking about and they will agree with you they are just as conservative as you they just don't even know it except for those people on campus there's their lost okay a study came out that showed when Democrats talked to minority is when leftist talk to minorities they actually dumbed down their speech they pander to people you guys believe that is that not racist like think about someone like Hillary Clinton saying you know you know what's one thing you always keep in your purse Hillary Clinton hot sauce all right I always keep hot sauce um but you don't write that's pandering they did the same study with conservatives and how they talk to minorities and they talk to them just like they talked to everybody else the main message that I want to get across to everyone today is that these white leftists these politicians don't care about you I know that's a sad thing to say it sucks but they're using you for their votes and for their own selfish game they champion minority struggles as their own but they know nothing about what is going on your communities or what is going on with your issues they have been using minority votes for far too long and it's time to end that but you know who does care conservatives conservatives care Donald Trump cares because they understand that when you succeed everyone succeeds conservatives are the party of America and the party of patriotism and we realize that the only way for our country to be the best is for everyone living in it to be the best so I'll end with this you guys heard from some amazing speakers today I'm actually before Candace I'm the last speaker and I'm the only white speaker seems a little racist to me but we won't go there but you guys have heard from some amazing speakers today learned so much and why why would you even be here today if you weren't going to go out into your communities to your friends to your family to your work to your university and tell everyone about what you've learned today and what the future of the country holds I'm going out tomorrow to shoot a video and showcase what is going on here in Baltimore showcase what is going on if anyone just after this has any recommendations for where I should go please come and tell me because I don't know this see very well but I bring that up I live in California okay I live in Hollywood it's terrible it's a horrible place to live okay but California hasn't always been that way okay California had Reagan California was a conservative state and now look at it okay it's leftist policies that have made California the way that it is but it's because conservatives haven't stood up and done anything against it right conservatives have capitulated to left us for far too long and we have to change that in your college campuses they're going to be so many times when people are going to yell at you and tell you how horrible your views aren't trying to shame you but you have to be that student to raise your hand and give your opinion every single time because if you're not that student no one else will be it's a chain reaction guys where I do this event and then all you guys go until one person they tell one person and that's how we can make a change that's how we can make a change but if you don't stand up and do anything against it if you are silent nothing will change and everywhere in America is going to look like Hollywood where I live and that's no not what we want at all no I think about I get a lot of the ideas that I talked about from from Dennis Prager as you know Prager you he's my inspiration thank you I'm gonna tell him you all clapped for him you're gonna make him very happy I get a lot of my ideas from him and we talked about the the ninth commandment you know bear no false witness and to me this means telling the truth and how important it is to tell the truth and you think about not seasoned and communist and slavers and all of these horrible atrocities that have happened have taken place because of lies right they were built on lies like slavery is built that you know black people are inferior to white people and Nazi Germany you know Jews are inferior so we want to exterminate them communism I mean the Russian newspaper was called Pravda right just truth in Russian is built on it was all built on lies and so but I can guarantee you that there were Nazis who went home to their family every night and were great people for their own for their own families they had they were loving to their wife their children they were good people in that sense but they were doing evil horrible things right so it's the same with the leftist right now in America is that they are convinced that the evil things that they are talking about that they are doing are actually good nothing that left us all want to commit mass genocide but what I'm saying is that they are convinced that these evil things that they believe in these things that are destroying this country are actually good for this country that are good for people and this is why telling the truth is the most important value in America right now we all have to do that what defines every American is not the color of their skin but the ideas that they hold and the left has manipulated those ideas into a never ending struggle that aims to destroy America and keep minorities down forever and we're here to change that thank you everyone thank you [Applause] [Music] ocean leaving my stink like rotten time we've got some difficult days are here but it really don't matter with me now because I've been to the mountaintop and I've seen the promise [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] ladies and gentlemen without further ado please give a big welcome to your flexing founder and final speaker Candace [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello how cute is she I mean absolutely adorable the promised land don't you guys get chills when you hear MLK speaking I mean I don't want to speak after him I really don't you guys enjoying yourself tonight how amazing are vus speakers right give them a round of the hand you know what we've started here and and this is why we finished with with the Promised Land because this is why we keep fighting right people say how do you get up out of bed and take the hits that you take I mean I've been accused literally I woke up one morning and I was accused of a mosque shooting in New Zealand did you guys follow that I mean it was the most ridiculous I'm like I speak about black America I speak about minority America refusing the lies of a left I get up on stage and I basically say the same thing every time I say black America I believe in you I believe in us hey Hispanic America minority America Asian America I believe in you I believe in us that's it that message is considered dangerous so dangerous that they are willing to put out a media hit against me anybody that can take Candace Owens down there will be a prize the headlines I have read about myself they call me a black white supremacist and anybody see white supremacy here tonight I mean the stupidity that it takes to come up with something like black white supremacy oh yes please I would like to help create a society that I can't live in that would be the logic I get up on every stage and I say please please please oppress me that would be the logic and that we have pockets of people that fall for it we have pockets of people that are still believing the media lies we have pockets of people that don't realize that the media do you want to know what they're after a civil war when I turn on CNN and MSNBC and I watch what they are saying and the lies that they are spinning they are after a civil war what do you think they want when they say things like Candace Owens is a Nazi sympathizer but Kennesaw ins hates black America that Candace Owens is inspiring mass shootings what are they doing they are giving permission for people to come attack me that is what they are doing they are saying to an Tifa you can show up where she is and you can do what you do and you can threaten her you we are giving you the permission and our hands are gonna be clean that is what they are doing it is a sin and it is wrong and they have gotten away for it for too long people ask me all the time what is blex it what is black sic\u00e1n is what is it right it's blacks it's Latinos it's Asians it's also white people white people too waking up we are all waking up to the left we are waking up to what they've done and it's not just to wake up guys it's an education it's a rillette ocation look at our schools in Baltimore not being able to find a single child that could pass a literacy exam across five schools why are they doing that because they know the truth an educated mind can't be enslaved so they have to make sure that we remain uneducated they like their minorities emotional and reactive and not logical and rational and so the challenge that I ask all of you minorities here today is when you see a story on any headline and it makes you feel something stop right there and think first think first in 2016 I had to do that cuz I was hurt just like you heard Brennan talk I was hurt when I watched who every person in this room felt something when we watched people bleeding out in cars because of a police officer we all felt something because we're human beings and we have a heart and the color of the person never mattered that was in the car it never mattered but then I stopped and I said why why just before an election cycle all of these liberal networks only showing this why are they showing black versus white why are they showing police brutality what is this I look at the statistics I said my goodness as a as a black person I have a higher chance of being struck by lightning than being struck by a police officer unarmed why are they showing this because they want us angry because they want us emotional because they want us irrational because when you are emotional you are able to be manipulated you are able to be controlled I have watched the media create an entirely different candice owens it's amazing it's amazing I've googled myself and I said oh this girl sounds horrible I'm in a protester and I said to myself it's incredible they make me sound like I grew up like a privileged rich girl in Connecticut no I didn't I didn't grow up as a privileged rich girl in Connecticut I grew up living in an apartment with my two sisters sharing a room or we had to have an exterminator come every month for roaches they say they know what people think when you hear Connecticut right that's what they do Candace grew up in Connecticut where the median income is $100,000 they're not commenting on my family they just want to make you think that I grew up and I've been out of touch of black America they don't want you to know when I lived through they don't want you to know that I grew up with uncles in prison and I and I visited my uncle in prison when I was a small child they don't want you to know that I made a conscious decision when I was a child to live a different life I was the little girl and this is what blex it is for the little girls that are wondering if there's something else but are living in existence and saying I don't want this for myself I always tell the story to people of my first play date and it's an important one I will never never ever forget this and it's stunning how when something is so important in your life your brain just locks it in there like it was yesterday I was five years old when I had my first play date I didn't go to preschool so my whole existence was where we lived in this low-income housing housing structure in Stamford Connecticut I didn't know anything outside of it everything I saw every day was black people and Hispanic people and then I went to school and my first friend her name was Lindsay and she'd invited me over for a playdate and I was so excited to go and when we got to her I was shocked as we were driving that the house has just got bigger and bigger and bigger I said oh my goodness do people live like this I went I went into Lindsay's house and and she had this beautiful big white house in Stamford Connecticut and and she had a nanny and everything was perfect in her house she had a playdate extra space in the basement that was converted into a playroom for her and her sisters everything in her room was seemed to me like it was it was Victorian style she had glass dolls and I said my goodness I can't believe people live like this I want that in that moment I decided that I wanted that I wasn't bitter I wasn't jealous I wanted to know how I could become that how I could live like that and then you know what happened they put me in the school system after kindergarten you start learning and and the teachers what are they teaching people actively well the reason Lindsey lives like that and you live like this is because of the color of your skin right that's where they start the programming this is this was liberal Candice I was learning actively too to think that white people had something against me this is what the public school system when you have to understand the uphill climb that we have the public school system is teaching us that we are oppressed that we it's because of the color of our skin they're not telling us that we are the authors of our own destiny that were in the driver's seat that we have to make different decisions they didn't want to say to me hey Candice you know if you wanted to live a different life your mother could have made some different decisions my mother dropped out of high school my mother grew up in an auto group homes coming out of her life she was one of nine children right those are different decisions that could have been made my mother had all of her children out of wedlock these are different decisions but you don't learn about that in school how do we start teaching people that they are the authors that they are in the driver seats of their own destiny I was blessed and I really do believe this I was blessed in 2016 and I never tell people who they support us candidates so please go out do your own research I'm just telling you my story I was blessed in 2016 and 2015 actually when Donald Trump came down the escalator and I'll tell you why I was blessed he came down an escalator and I was a liberal I didn't know much about politics but I knew that I had to be a Democrat because of the color of my skin I knew that right I knew I was on the left because of the color of my skin and he came down the escalator and my first thought was oh no not him oh it's up a guy that says he have fired president I say it's absolutely not absolutely not but then more importantly than the things that I was thinking were the things that I wasn't thinking you see I was thinking okay you know he's a reality TV star he should he shouldn't be president of the United States he says you're fired that's too gimmicky that's making our country a joke no way but I wasn't thinking this man is a racist but the media suddenly exploded and they said he's a racist he's a sexist he's a misogynist at one point if you guys remember this they were saying that he was incestuous and he had feelings for his daughter Ivanka you guys remember that's it was absolutely disgusting overnight but you see I I grew up listening to hip-hop music and until that man announced that he was running for president knighted States everybody loved to Trump okay everybody loves Trump and just like that the media said no no no no no no forget everything we said I know he was great he had his own show we loved him forget Beyonce and jay-z sippin poolside they wanted to be at mar-a-lago remember in the songs everybody wanted to be at mar-a-lago he was a symbol of wealth of Americanism that you had made it everybody loved Trump and just like that I was supposed to be convinced that he was a racist because he announced his bid for the White House that was my aha moment I still wasn't sure I wasn't sure about him but I said to myself and I asked a very important question it's a question that I want you guys to ask yourselves is it possible that racism is now being used as a theme to turn black people into single-issue voters the answer is yes when people know what you are afraid of they can control you okay when people know what you fear they can control you and the left has figured out that minorities fear racism so they call everything racist I mean I actually saw an article I believe it was the Washington Post and it said that air was racist and I thought it was a joke I was like this has to be sad tire I clicked it it wasn't they said that we are breathing worse air than white people it was amazing I said wow we're here right now okay air is racist I didn't think okay and the date it is laughable but you know there are people that are sharing those articles going see I told you I told you I had a feeling the air is racist I've been I've been completely killed by the press a thousand times over for a lot of things first and foremost I am NOT a feminist and I say that proudly and I'll explain to you why please do not believe that people that are calling themselves feminists today these modern feminists these Lena Dunham types that are out there boycotting Brett Kavanaugh are feminists they are not they are people they are radicalized feminist people that are operating under the guise of feminism to attack men okay a society cannot thrive without strong men okay they are trying to demote masculinity you see this in our society there's something wrong if you have any type of a feeling that makes you feel like a man there's something wrong with you they're trying to pervert masculinity they're trying to even pervert femininity there's something wrong if you're a woman and you want to raise your kids oh my goodness what is wrong with you there is nothing wrong with raising your kids in fact I would argue that's the toughest job in the world to raise good human beings this is the left this is the left you have a feeling like you want to get married what's wrong with you I had a feminist tweet at me and said why don't you go make your husband a sandwich okay did he does he want one baby why on earth would I have an issue with making my husband a sandwich modern feminism is just it's it's so crazy wackadoodle I can't even begin but this is the stuff that is required learning in school now when I was at university I was required to take feminism 101 okay as a part of my prerequisites for a journalism major let me tell you I'm gonna show you guys all how my class went you guys ready you guys are now all in feminism 101 we had a massive textbook in this textbook was every single problem at a spaced women since the beginning of Dawn's at the time of dinosaurs they created this textbook okay our teacher would sit at the front and she'd pluck out one of these things that happen in the textbook she'd say oh um pick up pick a struggle women are tired more tired than men why miss turns of the class and we all we had to do to get an A was say because of men that was it I mean was the it was really the easiest class you could possibly get an A in and no other thinking so she'd say I I lost my keys this morning why is this everybody just that was incredible that was incredible how fast you guys learn so I remember being in this class in my new business at a time when I was a liberal was on the left spire up feminism sounds great feminism 101 let's do it but eventually I said oh I just everything is just because of men I feel like there's got to be a little bit more going on and there's one particular class that I always tell people about and I will never forget it because retrospectively it was a turning point for me she plucked out one of her things from this textbook this wonderful textbook every promise is the beginning of time and it was a statistic scary statistic said 89 percent of the people in this country that have an eating disorder are women and she turns a classroom and she said why Einstein's in here it's just incredible and everyone in the class was you know these people had some of the people had picked the class and they're nodding and she went on and she said it's because men make us feel like we have to be skinny and they're critical in the advertising industry and I put my hand up and I said oh this one I'm just gonna have to try to rebut a little bit and she looked at me because we do this back and forth that she was like ah Candace what what could you possibly have wrong with what I just said I said professor I just I just feel like there might be something else going on I don't think everything can be because of men and and she looked at me and I'll never forget the words she uttered she me she said you know Candace I just feel like you were sent to me from the men's department I don't know I forget what I said back to her I said you know professor I just feel like I was sent to you from the common-sense department there might be something else going on that requires a little more critical thinking than men and we kept trading back and forth and we kept going and and eventually I hit her with a bomb I said you know I actually have been eating disorder many of you have followed my story no and and a lot of this is in my book as well that from the age of 18 to 22 I had anorexia so here I was sitting in her classroom and rather than turning around and asking us really genuinely ladies why do you think we have this problem she was telling me why I had this problem and she was wrong there was never an eating disorder because of man there was something men ever said to me my eating disorder wasn't even about being skinny it was a control mechanism when I felt that things in my childhood were out of my control I said this is something I can control I can control how much I eat and I became obsessed with it because it gave me control and it gave me power that was what it was about having nothing to do with the men the idea of men even calling other woman fat is I mean that's exclusively a girl-on-girl crime Here I am you know I'm right you know I'm right guys like oh she's thick girls back she's fat she's fat and that moment fellas like thank you thank you but you know in that moment and I look back and that moment was so critical it was so critical because what I was watching was liberalism versus conservatism you see liberals when they have a problem they look externally they say who can I blame who can I blame if I'm poor I can blame rich people if I have an issue and I'm black I can blame white people if I'm skinny I can blame fat people right know this what's it called body positivity movement right right yeah I'm blaming skinny people for the fact that I don't like my fat right this is what the left is all about it's the opposite game give them enough time it will be the short verses that's all right but conservatism is something different and something that I believe in you see when we have a problem we look internally we say how can I fix it how get here what can I do to change my destiny how can I correct this course that is conservatism I always say that that moment and that challenge that was presented to me when Trump came down the escalator which spiraled and led me here was a god-given moment and I will tell you what it is that that he's taught me and I think has been the greatest blessing of my life he taught me for the first time ever how to love the American flag how to love this country right he taught me how to love the red white and blue something that you don't learn in school you learned in school how to hate America you should feel guilty about being American when everyone else is suffering we should feel guilty about capitalism we should give it all away we're horrible people Trump made me realize that there is so much beauty and patriotism because do you know what patriotism does not know color patriotism does not care about your sex patriotism does not care about your gender patriotism cares about your ideas America is united by a concept about an idea and that idea is that you can come from nothing you can come from absolutely nothing in this country but if you work hard and stay out of trouble this country will reward you that is the American dream there is no person that has lived that dream greater or more to the truth than my idol my everyday inspiration my mentor my best friend my granddad my grandfather is about 80 now and he was born on a in the segregated south in Fayetteville North Carolina on a sharecropping farm so his first job was laying out tobacco to dry and he was five years old five years old that was his first job he'd get up before the crack of dawn because otherwise it was too hot under the Carolina he and he'd have to pick cotton and lay out tobacco to dry never ever ever in my life did my grandfather ever tell me that I couldn't do something because of the color of my skin I've never heard my grandfather make a negative comment and I grew up in his house during my formative years about white people ever he just believed in hard work he just believed in God he just believed in family he also believed in lectures every single morning we'd have to we'd have to read the Bible around the table and he'd ask us he'd read a scripture we have to learn something from it he make these big southern breakfast 'as yet weird rules too like no elbows on the table and if we if we broke the rules he'd always incorporate us into a prayer which was horrible because I was young and I thought he was telling God on me so he'd say dear God please help Candace realized that she shouldn't you know she shouldn't be turning the heat on in the middle of the night I go then I start crying I thank God that I'd run from the table and run upstairs and I look back on that now it was stuff that used to embarrass me when I was a kid so you know I wouldn't I was a part of the secular world I went to school it wasn't cool to talk about God it wasn't cool to say oh this morning we read scriptures I just wanted to fit in I was so embarrassed of that upbringing when I was young I look back now and I just I genuinely thank God I thank God for my grandparents I thank God for those breakfast because they've they've now provided a pillar in my life and I will end this by telling you where granddad is now granddad after moving up north marrying my grandmother when he was 17 years old he stayed married to her until his dying day fifty-fifty three years later in 2013 and when he retired he moved back to Fayetteville North Carolina and he purchased that sharecropping farm that he grew up in that is the American dream that I am giving back to our community I'm giving back to our community that we can work hard and we deserve a piece of that dream after all of that time thank you guys to every single person that came into this room and supported so all the speakers come on out come on out you know we got love [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I live in abundance love Lister

person was out to get me anybody who disagree with me is you know as racists that same victimhood mentality that's talked about today I was in it I had the same victimhood mentality a vision for for blex it is for the black community to be awakened for people to understand that you shouldn't vote based upon race in the board everybody is not raised since everybody is not out to get you that should be long over and done with people should vote based upon you know values if you believe in the Second Amendment in it and the First Amendment and if you are anti-abortion buh-buh-buh based upon those values and not and not your skin color [Music]", "4tSOxfo_M3M": "[Applause] but I'm so blessed to be here this is such a great opportunity for us this is these messages of something that we need to hear that we need to internalize this is our time to shine in America and my journey started from a very humble beginning I grew up in a diverse neighborhood and I can say diversity of thought diversity of action maybe not diversity of color and it was it was it was very trying for me but it built me to be Who I am today I must say this God has had a tremendous part and making me who I am and I know I'm here to talk about policing and imma get you that but I wanna I want to focus first on God because I believe that the black community and a lot of communities around the country have lost track of our faithfulness and understanding of the one true God and the reason why I want to show guys some love is because I used to walk around Fort Worth Texas with my pants saggin gold teeth in my mouth y'all and y'all probably don't believe me but it happened some of y'all know gold teeth I'm out I got young sabes tattooed across my stomach I got tats on my forearm I had a bad attitude nobody could tell me nothing I will fight but it took the power of God to deliver me it's a third roaring from God to take me to church and when I got to church God showed himself to me and I was saved I was baptized in Jesus name and I was filled with God's Spirit and you know what that did for me that changed my perception and how I looked at everybody else because I grew up in the neighborhood where we we felt like white people didn't like us I'm keeping in 100 we felt like white people didn't like us everybody around me was black all everything that we thought about came from a black perspective and I went to college and it started to break up some of that some of that grounded me of a feeling that that level of hatred but when God touch me I started to look at people as everyone in this building and everyone that I see as being God's children and that helped me go on the path of understanding our purpose together it helped me understand slavery and understand all of the things that happen in this country that we have been working hard together to accomplish I don't believe in a pro black agenda a pro white agenda I believe in a pro American agenda and a God chooses agenda and I'll say this that imma throw this out here then I'll get to police brutality just just bear with me I do not believe in the concept of white privilege and let me tell you what I do believe in I believe in the concept of Christ's privilege and I will tell you this not one person that walked in and out this door that day that it gets elected to president not one person can control my destiny but God not one person so I encouraged young brothers all the time when I talked to my virgin don't let these people lie to you don't let people be fake to you what happened to us being strong what happened to us holding up the mantle this what my dad told me listen if I go apply for a job and they don't hire me I'm a blonde for every job on the block and I'll tell you what when I get the job i'ma work hard and I'm gonna build the business and I'm gonna put the other business out of out of commission that's how you operate I came from a background of a strong father I had my dad in my life my mom and daddy broke up but my daddy was there he was there with that belt too I never forget that but he was there my dad wouldn't let me make excuses what do you mean what do you mean you late to school you better go earlier what do you mean you had two flat tires you better leave earlier break some flats with you but that's the power of male influence in our community and don't get me wrong my mama was great we need our mama's but young men in our country are seeking love in a connection with the man and these young brothers need their fathers I would not be here without my dad I would not be here without and he my dad my father didn't have to tell me a lot of stuff I saw who he was I saw what he represented on a day to day basis it gave me an example of how to be a man how to be strong my father did don't make excuses he started on the fire department he was 18 years old 31 years retired I remember when he first started to always tell me this he said Brandon there was some there was some racial tension on the department the black folks would stick together the white folks would be in their own group and he said but I always treated people fair and when they will come at me and they would treat me unfairly I was in my mind he said he would never disrespect people he said I made it up in my mind that I'm gonna work hard in those people who talk and treat me that way will be working for me one day and as God is my witness my dad made to the top he retired as a battalion chief and now he is the chief of an entire fire department out there in Texas now now let's get some police brutality let's get to police brutality because this is this is us this is this is my spot this is my sweet spot here because I was a police officer and how I became a police officer is because I needed to step up because I had a young child I needed to step up as a man because football wasn't working out for me and I said I'm gonna do what it takes to make a solid foundation for my child and I had never thought about being a police officer but I applied for everything in the City of Tucson and I said my god you gonna help me give me a job and we're gonna work from there and the funny story is me and my son's mind we had an argument the night before this phone calls he's talking on the phone we argue about I wake up the next day and I get a phone call from the Tucson Police Department and I'm like she called the police on me she's trying to see your brother in jail but that's why I answer the phone I say hello you know they said this to some police where I'm like they say mr. Tatum you apply for the job with this but what I did was I said I have to find out how am I gonna do this I've never even known a police officer I did a ride-along which I encourage anybody in here to do a ride-along I did it right on all the officers champagne for the first time in my life and this is the honest-to-god truth for the first time I like I saw a hero I used to think those football players were heroes not to get that around the applause nothing that gets after means nothing against athletes they work hard I was Anthony myself but I saw a man go from changing a flat tire there was an elderly lady she had a flat tire change so going lights and sirens 80 miles per hour down the roadway literally we almost crashed twice because people don't know how to move to the right so if you see the sirens move to the right don't look don't don't turn around no it takes move to the right and we were going through the lights we were flying and we got to the location they kicked the door in and then once they went in they let me kind of go in behind him and I saw a kid in a back room cutting his wrist he was cutting his wrists I could see him and Shawn pain saved that kid he saved that kid's life and I remember getting back in the car cuz he had been talking to me about my family before we went on the car just like that we were on that car and we get back in the car and he said Brandon what were you saying about your mama and I was like this what mama I don't know I had him and I couldn't believe it and I say you do this every day hey y'all mind me I was only a half of shift I was humming a half a day I said you do this every day oh yeah I do this every single day and from that point on I said god I gotta do this this is a calling for me I need to save and represent my community and that's what I did with my life I put all of my dreams aside I put my son every day I put it all aside when I put the uniform on I was willing to go out and die for people in the community I was willing to die and and I'll say this this is why this distrust me so much it's because I hate the way they're painting the picture of law enforcement in America it is disgraceful because the only element and I noticed firsthand I went to the cause I go to my mom and him house when they get burglarized I'll go pick up big child off the off the ground and put him in the body bag when he got shot to death I remember the effort and energy we put into these communities and so in the hood in these neighborhoods run by all these Democrats destroying the neighborhoods who is there to protect with nobody else will who is there to be brave when nobody else will when nobody want to snitch you feel me when nobody wanted snitch they don't want to cooperate they killing each other every day the men and women who put on that uniform and still go do that every single day even if even the facing them going to prison for something that they didn't even do wrong getting ridiculed fired they still go out of work and I can't stand when they lie to us and this is what the effect becomes when they tell a young brother that you should be afraid of police walking out the door they say say if you walk down the street they don't just shoot you up for no reason if they create that fear they built the wedge that they can market that they can continue to cycle through so they can get you to vote for them young brothers who are afraid of police do you think you're gonna cooperate with the police if you see a crime you think you're gonna talk to the police no when the application process come out do you think you're gonna apply for the police department no you want now the what that is instead if you if you cooperate with police in your community you can save your community the people who are selling dope on the corner won't sell dope on the corner no more the people who are murdered will go to jail for their crimes justice will be served for the people in the community and when you apply for the police department you become a police officer you can then adequately serve your own community the best way you know how and they create these environments that are residually destroying the community and it makes me sick to my stomach and I just want to deliver to you guys and I know a lot of y'all have to support the police department y'all support police officers but we have to we have to consistently support the police officers and support other young people and tell our children the truth about law enforcement and we have to be educated understand laws understand protocol understand use of force understand what a police officer can and cannot do to you because it is it is counterproductive if you're on a traffic stop and you didn't even know your rights and you listen to some fool on television telling you don't don't roll your window down as much men do they created an environment of violence I mean you get beat up the jump that you like Oh police brutality no no they they're within their rights to remove you from a car we have to teach our young people that we have to stand up and I'm gonna give you an example of standing up real quick I hope hopefully y'all can give me a estimate on my time cuz I'll talk all day but me and my boy Joe Patrick were in a Waffle House this is about standing strong in whatever you believe in man Joe Pesci was in the Waffle House we had our Meg make America great again hats off and y'all should have seen how they were looking at us they want to eat us alive and in my mind I'm like we'll bring it on but we were sitting there and they were they were staring us down and in what it made me think about was back in the civil rights times right when they were go to the county they do just exercising their rights as American citizens they have a right to sit down and eat peacefully we were doing the same thing but because they disagree with us because some of them are ignorant they gave us these dirty looks like they didn't even want the server was nice but the other people act like they want us to be there I saw brothers looking at us saying that we sellout but you know why I kept my hat on because we had a conversation in the car like hey man he won't take these hats off go home buddy spit in my food and then and then Waffle House you can see them cook your food so they spit in my food that's going to be a bad day for Waffle House but but I said you know what we have to remain strong we have to stand up for what we believe because if we don't they don't just push us right over I said I'm gonna go in this place and I'm gonna wear my hat because that's my right I can believe what I want to and if they don't want me in there I'll just go somewheres to eat but I'm not gonna be afraid to stand up for what I believe and I encourage as I close I encourage every single person under the sound of my voice to stand up for what you believe these liberals want to scare you it's a cowering they they want to scare you to not come to this event they want to scare us for not supporting one another they want to paint you as a racist you as a a sellout but we have to remain strong and I'll say this I say this in every speech because I feel like God put it on my heart no matter what happens no matter what it looks like in the end of all of this we're gonna win I don't know how you feel but I'm a person of faith I believe that God has already written a script that at the end of all of this if we have faith that we stay strong we will come out victorious because we're on the right side of the situation god bless you", "OLQw79AMfnw": "I wanted to say something about the Twitter thing which is really interesting and maybe Matt you noticed this as well because one of the things that boggled my mind before Elon got there and kind of made everybody run and spread some light was that the Trends on Twitter never made sense like how what a possibility what was the chances that trans visibility day was trending three times these Trends make no sense it's so clear that their manufacturing Trends aren't actually 72 likes yes but then now also a new look and I'm looking at the trends today and it's all like red tsunami like you know uh Maricopa County yes it's all suddenly very conservative Trends all the time so I thought that was really fascinating and it's very clear that they were manufacturing those Trends it's never been lost on me that the the three people three of the people at this table Matt Ben and Candace would literally Trend three times

listen to my music and just not pay attention it sounds like something on the radio you could easily mistake it for some negative song but if you listen to what is in the music it's all positive it's

themselves to think freely you know I have full respect for anyone who's making up an informed decision but if you're just following what someone told you to do do you really know if that's what you

feminist movement that's going on right now is destroying a lot of our men and we do need our men it needs to be a family structure and a relationship with God for families to succeed in life for

that's how we win the culture I just want to thank you guys first for being here this is amazing I mean to have all you people here the left likes to think that all of you people don't exist we're here today showing them that's not the case as you can see from that video it's probably the same thing that the left would call a lot of people here they would say that you have internalized racism like those Mexicans in that video who didn't get offended at all by what I'm wearing right one of the stupidest things that I've ever heard I win I did another video where I went to the University of California State University Northridge if you know anything about California never goes well when I go to a university and it was for Thanksgiving and actually ended up dressing up as a Native American you know and I had a black guy with me and he was a black pilgrim and we ended up giving we are trying to you know be nice for Thanksgiving ask people what they were thankful for gave out pumpkin pie and it didn't go over his plan and we had some students they came and they yelled at us they yelled death threats at me they cursed at me and they ended up ripping off my entire costume and then kicking us off campus driving us off campus and you know they were saying horrible things about our racist I wasn't terrible and so I thought you know am I am I really this racist person am i this horrible person so I decided to put these ideas to the test so I drove to the Navajo Indian Reservation outside of Window Rock Arizona 900 miles outside of LA and I went there and asked them and not one of them was offended by cultural appropriation not one of them thought the name the Washington Redskins was offensive and not one of them wanted someone else to offended for them on their behalf it is cultural appreciation not appropriation and so nowadays you have all these students like the ones that I talked to who are going to school and they were becoming more stupid than when they went in right I was there just two years ago I know exactly this is true but the university professors are teaching students how terrible America is how horrible white people are and that getting triggered is something you should do every single day right and so what does all this mean all these white leftists getting offended what does all this mean it really means that white leftists are the most racist people in America they think their virtue signaling antics are helping minorities but in reality it undermines them black people don't need you to get offended for them you're doing it for yourself and so that other white left us around you will think that you're woke but let me tell you something white leftist there is nothing woke about saying you care for the feelings of black people when you then turn around and advocate for the same programs and policies that have kept black people down in America for decades you know you think about something like affirmative action you know affirmative action sounds great on paper right I'll tell a little story real quick it's funny I went to I actually went back to the same campus that I got kicked off on wearing the Native American outfit asking people about affirmative action this was just the other day and I said hey like you know I started with about diversity I was like you know the NHL has so many white people like do you think that we should have more diversity and more black people in the NHL they're all like of course it should of course diversity is so important and I'm like wolf you know what about the NBA it's fold what black people should we have more white people in the NBA and they're like anyway just just that was funny but yeah affirmative action this racist all the way through it basically says it's a premise you know black people Hispanics they're not as smart as white people so we need to give them a leg up but you know why African Americans and Hispanics aren't in some of the same positions as white people because of the economic oppression that the left has put on them for the last 60 years you fixed the welfare state you fix the schools in these communities you won't need affirmative action anymore you know a study came out a little while ago about how how people act when they talk to minorities how the Left acts when they talk to minorities and they found that they actually dumbed down their speech they pander their speech when talking to minorities you guys see that speech with aoc a little while ago she like changed her whole voice talking to a bunch of black people or you think about someone like Hillary Clinton you know Hillary Clinton what's one thing you always keep in your purse hot sauce I always keep hot sauce in my purse right people yeah but someone like Hillary Clinton someone like Hillary Clinton who was time and time again put her own wealth and fortune above the plight of African Americans doesn't suddenly get a free pass because she says I keep hot sauce in my purse they did the same study with conservatives and how they talked to minorities and guess how they do it just like they talked to everybody else you know I wasn't I wasn't always a conservative no way not at all when I was in high school I actually ended up working for a Democrat senator mostly to impress this girl who I knew but I was also on the left and everything changed when I went to college okay I went cu-boulder she called the People's Republic of Boulder back in Colorado and I was in a sociology class I was an English major completely worthless degree but I remember I was sitting there in my intro to sociology class and the TA I'm sitting next to a black girl and she looks at me and she says you are oppressing this girl next to you because of the color of your skin and the black girl looks me and she's like this is really awkward for me I don't know what's going on right now and I was like you know I don't really feel like I was oppressing that girl and she didn't feel like I was oppressing her but this white TA at a $50,000 a year university because they tell me that I'm oppressing someone this is how you create a victim culture in America it happens at the universities you know I did I the people at the New York Times they asked me this the same story or I told them this exact same story and they got something a little bit different from it then you guys probably got from it they dedicated a whole line they said he did not graduate college it's like they use it as a means to shame me that's the best decision I ever made if you guys didn't see about two months ago Prager you and myself were on the cover of the New York Times no big deal no big deal was you know but they had a whole section where they're talking about some of the stuff that I did and they made it sound like I was lonely in college I was frustrated and then I saw these bright graphics from Prager University videos and I was radicalized by conservative ideas right that's what they make it seem like but the truth is conservative values conservative ideas didn't radicalize me conservative values and ideas set me free and I was really once I started waking up I realized I was actually a conservative my whole life I just didn't know it you know you are born a conservative you are taught to be a leftist I tell this story I pretty much all these these black sand events because I think it's really powerful but about a year ago I was in an uber I was in Los Angeles I was in a soup and the uber driver she's a Hispanic woman she picks me up and she's like oh you look nice like what do you do I'm like oh I'm a political personality she's like oh my god that's so great that we have young people getting Trump out of office thank you so much I'm just like yeah dude for sure but anyway I keep talking to this lady I don't usually talk politics with a new bird driver or anything but I keep talking to her cuz I'm going to an event and it's inspiring and you find out she was against affirmative action she was against the welfare state she wanted fathers in the home since she was a schoolteacher when she was on a uber driver and she didn't want them putting transgender bathrooms inside her school and it was like every single thing that this lady this woman believed in was a conservative value a conservative principle but she hated conservatives how does that work this is what has happened with the mainstream media the universities in Hollywood influencing everyone in America to believe to hate conservatives and to just love everything that the left does and we're here to fix that the main message that I want to get across to everyone today is that these white leftists and politicians who claim to have your best interests at heart don't actually care about you I'm sorry I know that's sad but it's the honest truth they claim to to champion your struggles and issues but they know nothing about what is going on when your communities the left has used minorities for votes for far too long and it's time to end it but you know who does care conservatives conservatives care because conservative realized that when you succeed everybody succeeds conservatives represent America conservatives represent patriotism and the only way for our country to be the best is for every single person living in it to be the best I'm gonna end with this is that you know you guys have been here today heard some amazing speakers saw some amazing moves up here and what is the point of you being here if you don't take everything you've learned and spread it around as much as you can that is why you are here you know I live in I live in Hollywood California it's a disgusting horrible place we got I mean the stories that you see on Twitter I mean it is true the needles the homeless the poop the high taxes right now I'm working actually on a mini documentary about it comes out Wednesday fleeing California small plug just check it out with Prague are you but what I say this because California used to be just such an amazing place everybody wanted to move to California is the greatest and now it's a horrible place and it's because of leftist policies but it's also because conservatives haven't stood up and done anything about what's happened in their state conservatives in California have capitulated to the left and let every single thing get worse so you at your university who's too scared to speak up speak up for what you believe in alright your work speak up or in yours with your family say what you believe because if you don't say something it's going to continue to get worse and the left is going to continue to win what defines every American is not the color of their skin but the ideas that they hold and the left is trying to manipulate those ideas into a never ending struggle to keep minorities down forever and destroy America it's time for all of us to fix that thank you everyone

I love the way Candace owns thinks my name is Candace Owens and you are watching how to create a mind I'm sorry it's been a while since I've made a video I was busy researching myself on the Internet did you guys know Candace Owens as a loser dangerous a consiglio to a mob boss alt right adjacent to be honest I don't really know her that is it doesn't matter somebody likes the way she thinks what do I think I think many people have had their minds programmed and enslaved and I'm gonna show you how easy it is to do that with three very simple verticals the first vertical is family where do all of your ideas come from in life initially comes from your mother and your father telling you what to do in life don't stand on the table don't chew loudly pray before you eat come straight home after school what would happen if somebody took this vertical away what would happen if they broke down the family we don't have to imagine it was already done in the black community in the 1960s LBJ introduced the Great Society Act which systematically removed father's from the homes of black youth yes welfare programs incentivize women not to marry the father of their children the government will give them more money if the father does not live inside of the home single motherhood rate in the black community has jumped nearly 72 percent since the 1960s 72 percent so where does the youth turn to when their family is not intact who tells them what they should and should not be doing or thinking second vertical and it's a big one culture this includes media and television or your kids watching Sesame Street whose that'll Grunk where's you been Donald Trump happens to have the most rash of any gross in the world this name is on every piece of trash in town do your children listen to hip-hop [\u00a0__\u00a0] down try like TV that's always fun he's the most mocked man in America monopolizing lately it's hard not to feel like you're being redundant interesting last but not least the third vertical education or as I like to call it indoctrination did you read the books at your children reading school this year did you pick the teachers who's teaching those teachers lessons are your children downloading every day and do you agree with them you see what Candace Owens thinks is simply her own thoughts I stopped watching TV and started listening to my own ideas I am choosing not to be a slave it's been almost 400 years exactly since the first slaves were brought over to America and yet we have not removed the chains I woke up one day I decided that I wanted to be Candace Owens I no longer wanted to be the product of a bunch of media and culture and ideas that were not my own I had to figure out who that was took me a while to figure out who I was before all of this nonsense all this indoctrination that we go through in life but I have to tell you I feel pretty free right now feels good I like liking my president I like loving my country and I have no idea why this is so controversial the Kanye West's tweet caused a firestorm because he went against the current of culture people like him are supposed to tell us what to think they're not supposed to encourage us to think for ourselves Kanye defied an entire vertical that was meant to enslave us to a certain set of ideas he did that with seven words the dam has been broken the conversations have started what happens now what an exciting time to be alive [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "nxvieL9txJY": "I was saved by Evolution we are all saved by Evolution we're all saved by the ability to grow and what I always find to be astonishing is the disconnect between the adults that are having this conversation who never grew up with technology right and the reason why they're able to kind of speak from this position of taking the moral High Ground is because they didn't they were allowed to be horrible people and they would not only did did their they didn't have the phones to to capture remember it they've forgotten it that is the ability like our as human beings our right to forget even is so important it's so important to say you know what I don't even

the one thing technology doesn't do it never forgets no it's right in front of you for the rest of your life for the rest of your life and to see these adults not understand the implications", "Z1oyWf2iZ6o": "I'm thrilled and honored to be here Candice is such an inspiration and we are blessed and what does it mean to flex it what does it mean to get out where are we running to what are we for in some ways our our challenge is not merely one of breaking free of an ideology or a set of political principles or platforms it's also freeing our mind freeing our mind from a pattern of lies that have been implanted their lies that masquerade as truths lies that have to be excavated out of us and so there's an internal kind of struggle for us to free ourselves and be able to think for ourselves and choose for ourselves Frederick Douglass when he was a slave in Maryland at one point went to his master a fellow named Hugh auld and he told him that he was giving some thought to the future and his master said to him Frederick never think about the future let me do that I will think about your future I will make it happen in effect for you and this got Douglass just sort of think about it and he realized ultimately that this was the essence of slavery the essence of slavery was that someone else controlled your fate someone else was in charge of your happiness and you in a sense become nothing more than an eternal child dependent on them now fast-forward to the 1960s when a very wily character Saul Alinsky was visited by a group of leftists who came to see him George Bush this is George HW Bush was giving a speech of the United Nations and these leftist had come up with a brilliant idea or so they thought and the idea was to have huge posters saying GOP equals KKK the Republican Party is the party of the clam and so they showed these posters to Alinsky and they go we're gonna show up at this speech and we're going to wave these posters that connect the Republicans and the Conservatives to the KKK and Alinsky took a look at it and he goes well that's dumb don't do that let me give you a better idea and linskey went into his closet and he pulled off some white sheets and he put them over his head and he said don't have these posters it says that say GOP equals KKK you come dressed as the KKK you put on the white sheets as if you are the clam and then you carry posters that say we love George Bush KKK loves Bush and olinsky's point is that if you do that every time that Bush begins to speak you guys just jump up and cheer wildly as if you agree 100% and Olinsky said if you do that the media you might have as well said our media will do the rest which is to say they will connect Bush with the Klan now interestingly elinsky totally knew that the Democratic Party was the party of the Klan he completely knew that not only did the Democrat Nathan Bedford Forrest start the Klan in Pulaski Tennessee but when the Republicans shut the climb down and closed it for 30 here's another Democrat Woodrow Wilson revived the Klan in the early 20th century and the Klan which had been mainly a southern organization now became nationwide so elinsky knows all this but olinsky's point is that we the Democrats we the left have got to figure out a way to take this hated institution the symbol of racial terrorism and murder and we have to pin this tale not on the Democratic donkey where it belongs but on the Republican elephant we've got to figure out a way to do that and we can count on our allies in academia and the media to support us in this enterprise of political deceit of political deceit and that's kind of what we're up against we're up against not just a distortion of our current politics but a distortion of the whole story of American life Abraham Lincoln was a progressive Dinesh Abraham Lincoln would never have supported the policies that you conservative stand for today Abraham Lincoln would have been on the opposite end of what you believe we hear this all the time this is in the textbooks this is in Wikipedia so it's actually what taking just a minute to see if that's actually true what what did what did Lincoln stand for and and our Lincoln's policies recognizable to us today as let's say continuous with the policies of Trump interestingly when Lincoln defined slavery he didn't define it in racial terms he defined it in in economic terms Lincoln said that the essence of slavery is you work I eat you work I eat what that means is that you labor but I take the fruit of your labor and appropriate it as my own slavery is theft and ultimately the crime of slavery is taking for yourself something that is not yours and Lincoln says this is the cradle of the Democratic Party this is what the left stands for and then Lincoln Sisson what about us what about the Republican Party what do we stand for Lincoln says we stand for the opposite principle in Lincoln's words the hand that makes the corn has the right to put the corn into its own mouth in other words we have the right to keep our stuff we have the right to the fruits of our own labor and this says Lincoln is the credo of the Republican Party so think about it let's fast-forward now all the way from Lincoln's times and there have been a lot of changes in the landscape of politics a lot of new issues that have come to the surface but isn't it true that at the at the core if today we were to define the Republican position on economics couldn't couldn't it be simply stated as just this the hand that makes the corn has the right to put the corn in its own mouth we believe that now and similarly if we were to define the position of the Democratic Party in fact if we were to define the essence of socialism this new socialism that is migrated now to the heart of the Democratic Party it's being embraced across the board I realize there are some differences between Bernie and Biden Bernie can at least remember his first name but but positionally they're quite similar despite their nuanced difference on a couple of issues on the majority of issues if you made a list from extending health care to illegals and on and on down the list their positions are pretty much the same so this is not socialism versus non socialism it's almost open socialism versus stealth socialism that's the difference the Democrats are angry with Bernie because he won't shut up he says what he really thinks he's not a camouflage character but the point I want to make is that if you were to summarize the essence of socialism is it not accurately described in the single line that Lincoln himself quoted more than 150 years ago you work I eat that's the essence of socialism that's the essence of the Democratic Party and so the Democrats are the same dirty rotten scoundrels they always were [Applause] now socialism you know for the whole four years of Trump we have not really had a single real public policy debate in this country it's been Charlottesville and stormy Daniels and the Mueller investigation and Russia collusion and impeachment and Ukraine but now suddenly at the very end you can say the clouds are parting and a big issue has come to the forefront socialism and for those of us who came of age in the latter part of the 20th century we can hardly believe it socialism really socialism is the most discredits slavery and in fact socialism became discredited largely because I think people realized it's a form of slavery it's a form of slavery and so in the middle of the last century almost two and three people on this planet lived under socialism the largest countries in the world China India were socialist I grew up under socialism I was just a kid but the three things I remember really well about socialism are number one the ration card it came along every month you had to show your ration card and that allowed you to buy this much of rice so this much of cooking oil the ration card set the limit on how much you could buy that's number one number two corruption now this corruption everywhere but corruption under socialism is so pervasive that you cannot literally move without paying someone under the table you have to do it literally every single day it becomes woven into the fabric of your life it corrupts you as a person you become essentially a shyster and a thief and third a seven-year wait to get a phone so I grew up without a phone why because we were on a seven-year waiting list to get the phone so socialism is this preposterous unworkable scheme that impoverishes immiseration turin eise's and so how can you possibly try to bring it back to try to bring it back it's kind of like if someone were to say you know what we're gonna bring slavery back let me think how insane that would be if someone were to say you know slavery was a really good idea but the implementation was poor every time it was tried it was imperfectly executed this time we're really gonna get it right but this is exactly what people say about socialism we're gonna get it right this time and you know here in the audience my wife Debbie from Venezuela and I mean there is a country it's one thing to grow up in a country like India which was for from time immemorial you know when I think about India when I was growing up people would say in America to their kids hey Johnny you better eat your food because there are millions of starving people in India that that was socialism but you notice that India starting in the late 1980s started moving away from socialism and people don't say that now now people say to their kids Johnny you better start a really hard because some Indian is waiting somewhere to take your job [Applause] Asians used to be considered super dumb now the considered super smart but it's not because they got smarter it's because their political system got better got better but Venezuela the tragedy of Venezuela is that this was a rich country an oil-rich country that now has gas lines that now basically has electrical blackouts so and the left of course what's funny is they'll say today well you know Dinesh we're not trying to become like Venezuela what we're not trying to become like Stalin or Mao or Lenin or Hitler what we're not trying to do that kind of socialism our socialism is really different our model is Scandinavia Scandinavia so I call this seven socialism based upon the idea that the typical Scandinavian is Sven and Sven of course is kind of a is not a very threatening guy swen is a kind of a metrosexual type of guy he carries a lady's handbag even though he wears a suit he bicycles to work his furniture is all IKEA and so people go well looks vans not a bad guy people don't live badly in Norway or Sweden or Denmark we'll take that as our model but very interestingly no one on the Left goes to Scandinavia they say that they want the Scandinavian model but they don't ask what the Scandinavian model is interestingly if you go to Scandinavia the first you know there's some sort of a debate going on right now whether are the Scandinavian countries really capitalist or are they socialist and the correct answer to that question I think is that the Scandinavians are completely capital in wealth creation and largely socialist in wealth distribution in other words the Scandinavians never killed the goose that lays the golden eggs their corporate tax rates are no higher and in some cases lower than the United States what's the minimum wage in Scandinavia there isn't one what is the estate tax that limits how much money you can give to your family or your children there is none give it all Bernie Sanders wants to tax financial transactions on Wall Street what's the Scandinavian transaction tax rate 0% so the Scandinavians by and large allow the capitalist engine to generate wealth then and this is the key point when the wealth is created they tax it heavily but they also tax everybody the principle of Scandinavia is that we are a tribe we're a single community kind of like we were in the Viking days and so when we get all this booty all this wealth we got to share it but everybody has to work for it and so when the people talk about Scandinavian tax rates yes those tax rates are 50 60 and 70% but you know who pays them pretty much everybody in other words those rates kick in at 50 60 and $70,000 a year so you make $60,000 a year you've got a turnover thirty to thirty five thousand dollars of the government straight away in other words there's no demonizing the rich there's no going after the billionaires the billionaire after all is also Sven he's a member of the tribe so the Scandinavians apply not only a high rate of Taxation but on top of the income tax rate they have the VAT tax 25% and the VAT tax is notoriously heavy heavier on the poor so the Scandinavians don't soak the rich they soak the poor and you can see why this is not a recipe the Democrats want want to go near because it implies very high tax rates across the board for everybody for everybody now American socialism is unique I think in one important respect this is actually what makes it different from the socialism of the past and even the socialism of marks the socialism of Marx was class-based socialism and the basic idea is that American society is divided into two the rich and the poor or to put it a little differently the capitalists the bourgeoisie and the proletariat or the working-class but the whole idea is that society is carved right down the middle these two groups and there are no other groups that matter but in American politics we have we have class socialism yes but it's married to identity politics and so in America the left will try to carve up society not two ways the rich and the poor but eight different ways society is divided into the rich and the poor but it's also divided into the black against the white and it's also divided into the male against the female and the straight against the gay and illegal against the illegal so the strategy of the left in this country is to cut American society into pieces seven different ways and then create this sort of community of victims across the board and try to carve out a Democratic majority out of those if we can get 51% of those guys we can then loot the other 49% with impunity that's the formula that's the Scandinavian formula by the way and interestingly as I've been thinking and talking to my wife about Venezuelan socialism it's really incredible that all the features of American socialism can be found not in Scandinavia but in Venezuela when you go Chavez was first elected at the turn of the century in Venezuela first of all he denied he was a socialist he said I'm not a socialist him I'm not I'm not doing that if in fact he said although I have a six-year term if I'm not doing a good job in five years I'll quit I'll leave but one thing Hugo Chavez did do is he introduced racial politics into Venezuela in a very explicit way the racial politics was anti colonial Venezuela was a multiracial society Italians Germans Asian Indians Pakistanis a whole bunch of people whites blacks in that society Hugo Chavez basically mobilized the minorities against the whites for the first time Columbus Day which was celebrated in Venezuela outlawed Columbus becomes a bad guy so here's a here's a common thread between Venezuela and America in both countries you have this kind of racialized identity socialism the second thing they do vote Chavez did in Venezuela very familiar to us demonized the rich he had a television program and in fact we're making a movie on this we have footage of Booga Chavez and he's walking down the street and the cameras of his own show it's called a low president a low Presidente hello president it's what they're following him and he just says things like who owns that building and his adviser tells him some Jew and he goes expropriated so he's confiscating the buildings as he walks down the street who owns that store some jewelers owned it extra tip and literally the people in the store are moved into the street right then so this attack on property and possessions and the rich this is a feature of Venezuelan socialism here's the third feature of Venezuelan socialism pretty recognizable basically once over Chavez got to power he said about rigging the whole system so it would become impossible for the socialist ever lose again so he stacked the Supreme Court by adding more members to the court there was a legislature with two houses of parliament he abolished one and he created a kind of super legislature so even if this Parliament over here makes a law that law doesn't become a law and until this group the super legislature signs off on it it's kind of like in Iran you can have an elected government but if they make a law it means nothing until the mullahs sign off on it same in Venezuela rigging the system for Hugo Chavez created his own antiva these guys are called the colectivos they're usually former criminals who go Chavez went to them and he basically said I'm gonna let you out but my job is to militarize you you become a kind of civilian military force and when people protest the regime by the way I forgot to mention guns are confiscated right before that so the Venezuelans are disarmed and disarmed so that they are defenseless against the state and now in Venezuela if you go out in the street to protest some guys will show up on motorcycles with sticks and batons they'll jump off and start beating you to a pulp that's Venezuela's antiva very familiar to us here in America were following this Venezuelan model and finally one more I could keep going on but one more in Venezuela politics is the way for the Socialists to make a huge bunch of money they get rich off of it so you know how you look on TV now Venezuelans are so poor they're eating their pets things are so bad in Venezuela but not for everybody right now if you go to the buddhabar in Caracas the wine is flowing there are there are huge platters of food the Chavistas the socialist class is living high on the hog the family of Booga chavez is the richest family in the country and one of the richest in the world net worth more than 1 billion dollars so think about this here in America we have something of the same thing the Clintons are broke after they leave the White House they now have 250 million dollars the Obamas are 40 million the Biden's of 150 million Al Gore is over a hundred million dollars by the way none of these people do anything they're all government employees these are not people who do fracking and take oil out of the ground they don't invent the iPhone they don't figure out Amazon Prime somehow on a through government leverage they make money even Bernie Sanders three houses if he gets out of the Democratic race and endorses Biden you can fairly expect it pretty soon he'll have house number four that'll show up somewhere so here's the point named for me a Scandinavian politician that has gone from zero to 40 million that person does not exist there's no aunty fine Scandinavia there's no demonization of the rich so the point I'm trying to make here is that for the left although they won't say it their real model is precisely the kind of gangster socialism that is destroyed Venezuela and if we let it will destroy the United States now we won't let it no I want to say a word before I before I end about our man in the saddle namely Donald Trump not only is Trump the political warrior in the fight against socialism but I think Trump is also the embodiment of entrepreneurial capitalism that's been his career in in in being a builder and an innovator when Trump was a young man in Queens IFS father had a business of essentially collecting rents mostly under from rent-controlled apartments in Queens and his father told Trump this is kind of how you make money don't cross into Manhattan just do this and Trump is in his 20s and what does he do he strolls across the bridge into Manhattan and he finds himself standing in front of Grand Central Station this is in the late 70s and the economy is actually doing very poorly and right there in front of Grand Central Station is the Commodore hotel a historic hotel but all rundown looks terrible people are sleeping in the hallways they can't charge 40 bucks for somebody to use a room because nobody wants to go in there and so Trump is looking at it and then he looks around and he sees all these commuters coming out of Grand Central Station dressed in three-piece suits all marching off to work and so he thinks to himself wow this would be such a convenient location for all these people but look at this hotel so he walks in and he says I I'm interested in buying this hotel and he meets with the guy in the hotels for sale and he asked the owner how much do you want for this hotel and they go who are you and he goes I'm Donald Trump and they go to ask the question differently who are you and he goes listen my family's in real estate you don't know them but here's what I want you to do what is the price you're asking for this hotel and they say ten million dollars and Trump says okay here's the sheet of paper sign right here that you will sell me this hotel for ten million dollars and they think it's kind of a joke and they go yeah okay fine here we go and Trump takes that paper and he starts hitting every bank in the city and he says I'm the new owner of the Commodore hotel and the banks go what you he goes yeah but I need some financing to close the deal here's the offer I need ten million dollars so just think about this here's Trump his dad won't help him he's trying to buy an expensive hotel he doesn't own the hotel and he doesn't have the money and he's never run a hotel but what he does is he's able to get city permits to do transformations to the hotel he's able to convince the banks to lend him the money he buys the hotel he makes a deal with the Hyatt chain to manage the hotel and then in his trumpian mode he goes we've got to completely change the front and the side and the back of the hotel and put mirrors on it and everybody from the planning committees to the environmental people to the architectural critics go this is ridiculous that will destroy the neighborhood it's completely out of sync with what this whole neighborhood looks like and Trump goes yeah I know but if I put mirrors on my hotel then in my hotel people can see Grand Central Station they can see the Chrysler Building they can see all these great monuments of New York reflected in my hotel so the bottom line of is Trump does it he owns the Commodore hotel he's in partnership with Hyatt a few years later they have a dispute hi it buys him out Trump makes in a few years 120 million dollars now this is not sort of Trump hey geography I'm not doing this just to brace Trump I'm doing this to say first of all that when Karl Marx described what entrepreneurs do he described none of this none of it entrepreneurs have the idea for a business they have the organization to carry it out they take all the risk they show the marketing prowess to sell the product Marx ignores all of it and basically access of the entrepreneur supplies only one thing which actually most entrepreneurs do not supply namely capital that's why I call them capitalists he acts like this is such a lazy guy who does no work has no imagination no ideas he's just sitting on a mountain of cash and that's all that entre so you see what's going on here right from the beginning socialist propaganda was aimed at confusing our mind and confusing our mind by creating categories who came up with the name capitalist Marx did why because the moment you name something is capitalist you get the idea that's all these people do they're just moneybags they just send a bunch of cash they don't do anything else but in reality entrepreneurs don't supply their own capital you think Steve Jobs came up with his own dough to start Apple no he went to a venture capital firm he went to a bank capitalists actually supply ideas energy innovation marketing and so on so we have to make I think and this is the way to convince young people the moral case for entrepreneurship the moral case for free markets and in the end of the day were making the moral case for what Frederick Douglas called many years ago the self-made man the self-made man so I'll close on this and his great speech on the self-made man Douglas says the self-made man is the only type of man who cuts his own path in life now the self-made man may sometimes take the wrong road but it's still his or her road to take he says the self-made man can sometimes be a little bit boastful a little bit vain because he thinks or she thinks that they did it all by themselves and it's not to say that they didn't get any help along the way but he goes nevertheless the self-made man is ultimately the architect of his own destiny is in the driver's seat of his own future and so for faradic Douglas what freedom meant was I'm not going to go to my master and say hey would you think about my happiness would you plan for my future will you give me a life dependent on you but would you let me go so I can be my own master so I can think for myself this I think is what makes America the great country that she is we make America great by making more self-made men and women and we're not going to try to save the world or intervene all over the place here and there if people want the American Dream we're not going to give them our troops and we're not going to give them our money but we're happy to share our recipe if you want to be like us do it the way we did it liberate your citizens let them be the architect of their own destiny we're unique in the world in this respect and it's this uniqueness I think that's now in the balance so this is a critical year and sometimes I think about the weight on our shoulders it feels like it's it's heavy we have so many forces arrayed against us but on the other hand at the end of the day the truth is on our side history is on our side knowledge is on our side and I think working together as a team in concert we're gonna do it because we're Americans we're gonna make it happen thank you very much thank you", "40suMmbfnn8": "ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage author and radio host Larry elder [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you so much Wow didn't expect that my goodness now if you don't follow me on Twitter and Instagram after all of that that's on you thank you so much for having me Candace has invited me to several of these events I really do appreciate it let me give you their quick Cliff's Notes version of how I got into talk radio I was living in Cleveland I'm from LA but I'm living in Cleveland and I wrote an op-ed piece for the newspaper this is about 30 years ago and I argued that racism was no longer a significant enough problem to hold anybody back if they're willing to work hard I get a phone call from a producer of a radio show he said are you black I said I think so he said would you want my guys show and talk about this you really believe that racism is not a big problem anymore I said I didn't say it didn't exist I said it no longer can hold you back if you learn to work hard you stay focused and don't make bad moral mistakes so I'm on this guy's show for an hour now Cleveland is about 50% blacks so virtually all the callers were black I was called in an hour and Uncle Tom a bootlicking Uncle Tom a foot shuffling bootlicking Uncle Tom a bug-eyed foot shuffling booth hey Uncle Tom in Oreo as in brown on the outside white on the inside coconut the same concept the Antichrist and then I was called that word to call a black person when you really really want to hurt him I was called Republican a man can only take so much but you know what I wasn't called I wasn't called wrong I said the number-one problem in this country in general and the black community in particular is the fact that 70% of black here to now born into this world without a father in the home 70% and forget about larry elder Obama once said a kid rathe another father is five times more likely to be poor nine times more likely to drop out of school 20 times more likely to end up in jail it is far and away the number one problem facing this country now what's happened people like Walter Williams the extraordinary economist says in 1940 only 12% of black kids were born outside of wedlock there's some census data that suggests 1918 90 a black child was slightly more likely to be born to mother and father Mary than a white kid then comes the war on poverty 1965 Lyndon Johnson argued that black people need to have assistance send out a bunch of social workers literally knocking on doors uprising women of the availability of money providing there was no man in the house we've gone from 25% black kids born outside of wedlock in 1965 to 70% now what the welfare state has done is it's in devised women to marry the government and allowed men to abandon their financial and moral responsibilities and that's not racism we need to do something about that was I wrong when I talked about the importance of choice in school I went to a school called Crenshaw high you guys know that school if you saw the movie boys in the hood that was my school front page article LA Times a few years ago 3% of kids at my former high school can do math at grade level not a type of three percent and that's up from 2% the year before now what parent is going to send her kid to a school we're only a 3% of the kids can do math at grade level if that parent has an option out and by the way the school is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] school the reason I know that is because ice-t went there are 10 years after I did and told me he chose it because he wanted to go to a [\u00a0__\u00a0] school so now you're living in that geographical area and you're assigned to a school we're only 3% of the kids can do math at grade level and the school is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] school and you were forced to go there one party however wants to give you options one party believes in choice and there's a program called the DC hope scholarship program google it check it out the test scores have improved more importantly the dropout rate has significantly improved and parental satisfaction is up less violence in the school and what it does is give the parents in eight thousand nine thousand dollar scholarship that the parent can use to go wherever that kid can get in so the the program is cheaper than the amount of money they're spending on public schools parents like it and guess who wants to shut it down you know in 1997 Time magazine and CNN polled black teenagers and white teenagers and they asked him where the racism was a major problem in America it's 23 years ago now to surprisingly both said yes more black kids said yes than white kids but both of them majority of them said yes but then black kids were asked this question is racism a big problem a small problem or no problem in your own daily life this again 1997 90 percent said no problem or small problem in my own daily life in fact more black kids than white kids said failure to take advantage of available opportunities is a bigger problem than racism that's 23 years ago that's before the election of obama reelection of obama speaking of whom when he was Senator he gave a speech at a historically black college and he talked about the amount of racism in America and he said the Moses generation referring to the generation of MLK has gotten us 90% of the way there we have his generation he called it the Joshua generation have an additional 10% to go I thought that was a pretty fair reflection of how much racism there was 10 percent to go this is before he became president now fast forward racism institutional racism systemic racism structural racism use your favorite term how do we go from 90% of the way there to racism now is pernicious which is what Eric Holder said what happened what happened is they are trying to make you think like victims so you pull that lever 95% for one party hard work wins Candice gave me 15 minutes um I don't want to go over quick story about my father my father and I sat down when I was 25 years old and had a long talk the talk I thought was gonna last five or ten minutes we ended up talking for eight hours my father and I did not have any meaningful conversation from the time I was 15 years old to 25 I had to work for him it didn't like working for him he yelled he screamed he was Moody he was grouchy we really had a real problem and when I was 15 years old I walked out of the restaurant and my dad and I did not have a meaningful conversation for 10 years lived in the same house well he didn't he didn't abandon the family I just ignored it but and now I'm can't sleep I'm having difficulty sleeping and I know it has something to do with my father and I decided to talk to him about why I had such issues with him so my dad and I sat down and I said now Larry don't tee off on the man don't tell him about all the spankings he gave you all the things he said you don't do everything so I sat down and teed off on him you guys know how I can go so for 10 minutes I told him everything he'd ever done every whipping every spanking everything he'd ever said to me and after 20 minutes I was out of ammo and my dad looked at me and he said is that it you didn't speak to me for 10 years because of that and I said yeah he said let me tell you about my father this is the first time we ever had this conversation I knew my dad was an only child and I knew his father wasn't around because I met his mother once and we never got any any presence from anybody on his family side so I knew my dad didn't have much of a family but I didn't care I didn't like him anyway he said your last name yeah elder that's not my father's name what's your father's name I don't know never met him who's elder well he was one of my mother's boyfriends she had a bunch of boyfriends each one more irresponsible than the other one elder was an alcoholic and when he did work he would bring the money home to his mom to my to my mother and then when he'd wanted on Wednesday she wouldn't give it to him she beat the crap out of her if I stopped him he beat the crap out of me my mother my dad said couldn't either read nor write I was born in the back of the house I'll even know my birth date I know the year on another date my dad comes home at the age of 13 stars quarreling with his moms then boyfriend she sides with the boyfriend throws my father out of the house never to return you're talking about a black boy born in 1915 Jim Crow South at the beginning of the Great Depression literally thrown out of the house at 13 years old dropped out of school at 8th grade I defy you to find somebody who had a hand dealt like that I said dad what did you do for next 7 8 hours we're talking about his life and he said I went down the street and I walked down the road it wasn't the street and I took anything I could get ultimately my father became a Pullman Porter in the trains they were the largest private employer of blacks in those days and so this little black boy was able to travel all around the world the country and he came to California once and it was sunny people seemed less racist my dad said maybe I moved to California sometime Pearl Harbor my dad joined the Marines I said dad why the Marines he said to reason you know I'm gonna say two reason what are they two reasons they go where the action is and I love those uniforms my dad was stationed on the island of Guam he was Staff Sergeant he was cooked might be I can look at a cake and tell you what's in it so he goes back to Chattanooga Tennessee where he met and married my mom to get him a job at the short-order cook and he's told we don't hire [\u00a0__\u00a0] my dad said I cook for the Melton we don't hire [\u00a0__\u00a0] he went to an unemployment office lady says you went through the wrong door my dad goes outside he's colored only goes through that door to the very same lady who sent him out my dad went back to my mom and said this is BS I'm going to California get me a job as a short-order cook coming up to California he walks around I'm sorry you have no references my dad said I cook you have no references my dad said I'll cook for you for free for two weeks just write me a reference if you think I've done a good job wouldn't even do that he goes to unemployment office this time just one door and he says what time do you open she says 8:00 what time do you close 5:00 I'll be here at 8:00 I'll stay here too you find something my dad sat in a chair for a day and a half she calls him up she said I got something I don't think you one in my dad said I'm sure I'm gonna want it what is it she says it's cooking it's cleaning toilets and the Pisco brand bread my dad took that job for ten years cleaning toilets took a second job with another Bread Company called Barbara Ann Brea cleaning toilets cook for a family on the weekend and get additional money and went to night school two or three nights a week to get his GED the man never slept which is why he was grouchy all the time 15 minutes here half hour here hours sleep here and then you come home to a house with three rambunctious boys what kind of mood are you gonna be in so my dad got bigger and bigger and bigger during this eight-hour conversation and Larry got smaller and smaller and smaller at the end I'm crying and I said dad please forgive me for judging you so harshly he said there's nothing to forgive you didn't know but follow the advice I've always given you and your brother's hard work wins you get out of life what you put into it Larry you're not in control of the outcome but you are 100% in control of the effort and before you moan about what somebody did to you or said to you go to the nearest mirror look at it and say what could I have done to change the outcome and finally no matter how good you are how hard you work sooner or later a bad things are gonna happen how you address those bad things will tell your mother in me if we raised a man final story about my mother my mother was raised on a farm Huntsville Alabama so my mother was almost like royalty compared to my dad she I asked her what was it like during the Great Depression she said what Great Depression we grew her own stuff we sold our surpluses people we went right by us night and day hurt her life compared to my dad and my mother always told my brothers and me no one can make you feel inferior without your permission we read a poem in class by a poet named Countee Cullen and he goes like this while riding through a Baltimore still small and full of glee I saw a young Baltimore E and a kippah looking straight at me now I was young and very small and he was no whit bigger and so I smiled but he poked out his tongue and called me [\u00a0__\u00a0] I saw the whole of Baltimore from May until September of all the things that happened there that's all that I remember well the teacher was pissed the class was pissed I was pissed everybody was pissed teacher talked about how it's gonna permanently damage this guy's ego he'll always think of himself as a second-class citizen he'll never forget this it'll torture his psyche I knew my mother was gonna have a different attitude I didn't know what it was gonna be but I knew it's gonna be different so I come home my mother's in the kitchen stirring a big pot of greens frying some chicken I'll never forget it I said mom we read a poem in class I want to get your reaction to it she said go ahead as it goes like this while riding through a Baltimore still small and full of glee I saw young Baltimorean people looking straight at me now I was young and very small and he was no whit bigger and so I smiled but he poked out his tongue and call me [\u00a0__\u00a0] I saw the whole of Baltimore from May until September of all the things that happened there that's all that I remember my mom took the spoon out of the pot hit it on the side turned to me and she said Larry a darn shame he let something like that spoil his vacation how many wings do you want thank you so much for having me may God bless you may God continue to bless the United States of America I love you I love you so much [Applause]", "RxOS4tyxYoo": "hey guys candace owens we are going to recap 2021 as well as forecast what you can expect from me in 2022. [Music] 2021 super super big year a lot of changes um my year started with having a son so i had my first born child in january of this year and then right after i had five weeks and i had to move my life from dc to tennessee to start a new show so it was a lot i kind of feel like it was i blacked out i almost don't even remember the first few months of the year because there were so many changes being a new mom breastfeeding kind of trying to get into that new schedule and then arriving into tennessee into a house that had no furniture it was just it was one big blur i didn't start to really feel like myself i mean imagine five weeks after you give birth you have to do a photo shoot for a billboard i mean it was totally insane meeting all new people new team don't think i started to feel like myself until like four months after but i was kind of glad that i got right back into work i know that sounds crazy and i'm not saying that i recommend it but you can also see how you could just get stuck in all of the newness of being a mom um so i think it's sort of having something to do helped me to feel more like myself in the end so i would say that was a pretty big start to the year i would say in one word this was a year of transformation just a year of transformation everything was new and then beyond that i still had to keep up my speaking tour so i was flying at least once a week to a different city giving speeches all around the world whether that was in front of college campuses or gop dinners it was just a very aggressive year of travel i started to feel like i was going to hit a wall probably in october i was like i cannot physically get onto another airplane anymore but i'm glad i did it i always i always feel blessed to be able to share my message you know i just think that especially a lot of the stuff that i've been saying or that we've been saying as conservatives uh kind of came into a new focus for people that have disagreed with us in the past due to all of the covid protocols um so it's been a tremendous year what were some of your favorite interviews some of my favorite interviews uh it's hard to pick um without question i can say that the north korean defector yanami park was an incredible interview i mean i was close to tears and the audience i mean everyone she's got a standing ovation i think she's the only person that's ever gotten a standing ovation you could hear a pin drop as she was telling her story it just she had this way of really painting the horrors of you know what it means um to live in a socialist regime that controls virtually every aspect of your life and i think it bore a new resonance in the time of covet in america and people realizing that freedom is frail so she immediately comes to mind when i think about my favorite interview i loved doing tim ballard uh he's just a hero and i think that's another topic that i never i know it sounds stupid i never thought i would be interested in covering the human sex trafficking it always felt like this was an obscure topic that people were um being hyperbolic about and not until recently did i realize that there's really something there and we continue to talk about children that has been such a major theme i think throughout all the first of the first season and i i think i personally inspired um the moms all across the nation i did that video um talking about mama bears and it went viral and suddenly moms were showing up at these school board meetings and they were demanding answers and i was telling them to go in there and realize that you know these are our children and we have to fight for them and i think that there has been an awakening due to that focus that i think me and other commentators have had on talking about children and why you know any country any government rather that wants to overreach and and seek true omnipotence really has to focus on brainwashing the next generation um so sticking with that theme i think any any person that i hosted on the show and any individual that talked about children including a child i mean the girl who got suspended like 38 times for not wearing a mask she was absolutely adorable she was a favorite i like all my guests it's really hard to pick i loved doing the alex jones one because it was so unexpected and it to me anything that allows me to stand up to big media you know sending up to big government like oh you know what big media has decided that no one's gonna talk to alex jones it's like you know what screw you i don't listen to you i get to decide who i want to have conversations with and it always feels good at the end of the day to do something that people are telling you arbitrarily that you're not allowed to do you had a couple of viral tweet moments um throughout the year one of them was with cardi b yes that was a very viral moment still gets me so angry so cardi b just was losing a debate and then just randomly tweeted out a doctored tweet of mine like pretending it was a tweet that i had sent out and doubling and tripling down and pretending that um i had really you know but that my husband had an affair with my brother i don't even know this was actually so ridiculous that it wasn't but it got me so angry because it was just so petty and it was so small and you know it was just a demonstration of how ignorant she is how unable she is to have a true debate about anything and obviously this went viral and you know my lawyer sent out a letter to her lawyers and basically said you know we're going to sue you and we're going to sue you in georgia and um she basically said that she doesn't live in atlanta full-time that we would have to sue her in new jersey it was this whole long back forth and at the end of the day you know my lawyers i'm still talking to them but they basically said as two public figures you could sue her and you will get a lot of headlines about it but because of new york times versus sullivan there's just so much protection for people to be able to lie just to lie and pretend um that it's the truth and there there's no consequence and it's one of the things that i have been the most passionate about you know new york times for sullivan needing to be reversed not because of a petty spat between cardi b and canis owens but because it's the reason that our country is so divided because there are people that are quite literally subscribing to fake news all day every day believing that donald trump peed on hookers in russia because they're watching what they deem to be legitimate news sources tell them that because rachel maddow is telling them that and then after two years of taking them down this rabbit hole she goes oh never mind none of it was real it's problematic and if journalists could be sued if individuals could be sued for you know lying and smearing um about public figures then this wouldn't happen they would just have to tell the truth and i always say the united kingdom is such a standard for that obviously my husband is english and every single time any publication in the uk writes anything false about me i send out one letter and they instantly have to issue a retraction because they have true defamation laws and me being a public figure does not give them a permission to lie about me i don't understand why america is the only country that has that standard that allows the press and allows public figures to be lied upon um by any individual in the world so you know we have that we have one year to decide whether or not we're going to sue her we have the lawyers in new jersey that are kind of like you know that we've signed with um it'll be a decision that i'm going to make probably in the new year for 2022 i would say that i'm very happy with where the show is now and i want to keep going in that direction i always want to be a voice for the topics that people feel are not allowed to be voiced because we're so controlled and we're so censored in this country i always want to be known as the political risk taker but also wanting to dabble more into the cultural side um you know i'm i don't consider myself to be a political figure i kind of consider myself to be at the intersection of of culture and politics and i love that on my instagram pages i can be all of the other pieces of candace owens and you know i love cooking i know people follow my instagram page they're always following me cooking and i love fitness and people love to follow that stuff so i kind of said we should peel these out and put up people like put up the recipes and i'm like we should do that separate not in the middle of the show but just kind of doing little segments that can play on youtube um of all of the other stuff that i like because i think it's really important for conservatives to create their space within culture and to stop allowing the left to dictate that for us for 2022 you can expect lasagna i'm definitely gonna reveal my lasagna recipe that you guys like definitely at some point in 2022 so that's all i've got for you stay tuned", "M7M4y8jEn_s": "it's all tied to some big Russian stock fraud

dinesh d'souza [Music] thank you wow guys i'm so excited to be here delighted to be part of blexit and uh what a critical time for our country now what's the end game for the left today we we see all the tactics that they're doing paramilitary gangs on the street something that i don't think i've seen in my lifetime you'd have to go back to italy in the 20s to see armed thugs attacking business owners then a deep state by which we mean the police agencies of government somehow weaponized to go against political opponents what is what is the left up to those are the means but but what is the end what's their goal their goal is i think socialism socialism they wanted to they want us to be the united states of socialism now socialism is the most discredited idea since slavery it has been tried in 25 countries it has been failed everywhere it's tried it has produced a body count that closes that approximates a hundred million and yet powerful people want to bring it back it makes no sense you know slavery is dead i suppose there are certain forms of slavery that still exist but there's no political party anywhere in the world that advocates slavery you don't have a group of people anywhere in the world who say well you know slavery was actually an excellent concept but the implementation was poor this time we're going to get it right but that is what people do say about socialism now if you if you look at the socialism being promoted by the left today the socialism that has kind of migrated from bernie to biden and harris it is actually different in a couple of respects that are worth worth commenting about the first the left says it's democratic socialism it's not authoritarian socialism they say we don't we don't want to be like mao or stalin this is democratic socialism it's it's sanctified by the idea of democracy itself but if you think about it democracy doesn't actually sanctify any kind of confiscation at all when i was a kid i used to go to school and at recess we'd play marbles and i'd carry you know 10 marbles in my pocket so imagine if i was jumped by a bunch of guys or one guy who attacked me and took my marbles authoritarian socialism one guy is seizing my possession by force but here's the second scenario i go i fall in with a bunch of guys they take a vote the ten of them and eight of them agree let's knock down dinesh and take his marbles in both cases i've been robbed and the fact that eight guys voted to rob me collectively doesn't make it any more just than if one guy did it so the democratic socialism doesn't solve the problem now second the left says and we can observe this their socialism is not the socialism of class it's the socialism of identity politics in other words it is socialism married to identity politics we were talking in the green room a moment ago about some of these athletes like lebron james well but let's think about it it's very tempting to say that guy's so dumb he doesn't know what he's saying but the truth of it is he actually does know what he's saying let's try to think about what he what is what is lebron and i use him here as a metaphor for a larger phenomenon what are these guys up to well here's what they're up to here you have lebron james a guy who's making what 80 90 100 million dollars a year and think of the lifestyle that goes with that it is a lifestyle a lifestyle of indescribable luxury you don't actually have to move a finger it some of us who are lucky enough might have a maid who comes to our house and cleans it once a week lebron james has domestic staff most of us feel really good if we get to travel first class lebron james has a private plane so if you look at lebron james let's say compared to some ordinary guy some working class guy who makes 50 000 a year lebron james actually makes 2 000 times what that guy makes so if you were to apply kind of a marxist analysis lebron james would be the oppressor and that guy would be the victim according to marx and and you can only imagine what marx was thinking about capitalists who ran big businesses imagine if you told him here's a guy who basically bounces a ball and he makes 2 000 times what another guy does who works like 60 hours a week so lebron james knows all this he doesn't want to be having a class discussion in which he has to explain why in exchange for what he does as an athlete and by the way think of what it means to be an athlete i'm not denying that athletes work hard but by and large an athlete is a major winner of the genetic lottery right you or i can work hard we can't get on the nba we have no chance so what so it's a very clever move then to take the class analysis out and flip the lens in the camera and stick in the race card because now lebron james gets to go up to some guy whether it be black or white or asian it doesn't matter and basically say you owe me buddy because i lebron james i'm black and so i am a victim and you are white you could be treated differently by a cop who stopped you on the street you're my oppressor so in addition to all the indescribable privileges that these athletes have on top of it they want the moral credentials of being a victim so the socialism we're talking about here i call it identity socialism because it marries see marx divided the world into just two groups the rich and the poor that's it but the left today divides america many different ways rich against poor true also black against white also male against female also straight against gay also legal against illegal so division is the name of the game and what is their goal their goal is to create a majority coalition of oppressed victims they want to assemble a coalition of 51 percent so they can then ultimately loot and oppress the other 49 namely us their socialism is not just about money it's not just about picking your pocket or taking your earnings it is about that but it's also about running your life it's about telling you what to think it's about controlling what you say in public it's establishing a regime of conformity it is ultimately about regulating the way you ex you express your religious opinions whether you own a gun so this isn't just about repressing our economic freedom it is about repressing our freedom pure and simple that's their goal they want to turn us into worms and the reason they hate people like me like candace like trump is we won't go along we won't play with their narrative [Applause] i want to talk about a couple of tidbits of american history because so much of what the left has been doing is trying to sanitize and rewrite and reinterpret the narrative of america and one of the reasons the new york times came up with this idea of the 1619 project one of the reasons that the left targets the the monuments not just the confederate monuments but the monuments at all is they're trying to they're trying to conceal an important fact that is that is concealed in virtually all accounts of american history and that is that the democratic party was established it was founded on a very clever bargain to protect the slave plantation that is the actual origin of the party let me explain so the first democratic president was a war hero andrew jackson a slave owner and very popular because he had been the hero of military expeditions his election and re-election were pretty well assured but his vice president was a man named martin van buren a northern democrat from new york who wanted to make the democratic party the permanent party of america to have it dominate american politics for 50 years which by the way it did until the civil war and martin van buren although a northerner realized that the way to do that was to go south and so he made these secret trips to the south and he met with a guy named thomas ritchie thomas ritchie was the sort of most influential spokesman for the slave plantation owner class richie was the editor of the richmond enquirer and he was the most influential virginian that spoke as a sort of voice for slavery and martin van buren had a series of secret meetings with richie the content of which is not known but what we do know is what van buren subsequently wrote to richie in a letter that says in effect this he said look he goes you slave owners need help because there's an abolition movement that is brewing in the north that is going to be attacking slavery in the north at this point he didn't know about the republican party there was no republican party but there were abolitionists and so martin van buren says we need to have a force in the north to block the abolitionists and protect slavery in the south he goes you can defend slavery in the south but you need friends to do it for you in the north he goes that's the job of the northern democrats so the bargain he proposed is that the slave owner class supports the democratic party in return for which the democratic party in the north blocks anti-slavery activism and keep slavery going permanently so the point i'm trying to make here is that the reason the left likes to talk about 60 19 when there were a handful of slaves and indentured servants so they like to talk about the american founding what they're concealing is the fact that it was eli whitney's invention the cotton gin in 1793 that caused the massive proliferation of slave plantations in the south and then in the 1820s led to the rise of a political party specifically with the purpose of protecting the plantation that's the role of the democratic party that's its history um this guy roland martin who used to be on cnn you know he goes you're you're you're misstating the history of the two parties he goes it's really a divide between the north and the south this is part of what i'm talking about the attempt ultimately to blame the south for the crimes of the democrats and when abraham lincoln spoke about the four horsemen he was talking about the four great defenders of slavery he named them and of the four one roger tawny the guy who wrote the dred scott decision was lincoln counted him as a southerner even though even though the guy was from maryland but nevertheless let's count him as a southerner but interestingly all the other three that he named were northern democrats the former president franklin pierce who's from new hampshire he mentioned james buchanan who is the current president at the time from pennsylvania and stephen douglas who was lincoln's own rival from illinois so you notice this whole attempt to besmirch the south is camouflaging the crimes of the northern wing of the democratic party i want to flash forward to a second titbit that is worth knowing about because it ties into the so-called big switch the importance of the big switch to the left is is very obvious right because if you're the party of slavery and segregation and terrorism and jim crow and the ku klux klan and if you did all those things how do you get out of it short of admitting it short of apologizing short of paying some restitution how do you get out of it well the only way they get out of it is by basically saying you know at some point the two parties switch sides i mean first of all on the face of it this is ludicrous not only the implausibility that it could have happened but let's say the parties did switch sides that still doesn't take all the crimes that you did and put them on someone else i mean if you're a thief and you live on this side of the street and your neighbor is a good guy and he lives on that side and then you each trade homes that doesn't trade your moral characters that doesn't mean that you're exempt for all the evil deeds that you did you still did them [Applause] but i do want to say a word about goldwater because because you'll sometimes hear from people who know that goldwater did oppose the civil rights act of 1964 and goldwater did in fact win the deep south so goldwater actually appears to be a sort of confirmation of what the left is saying about the big switch the interesting fact however is that goldwater is actually kind of an anomaly goldwater was a first of all he was a crusty kind of very cantankerous independent-minded guy he was also economically a libertarian his reasons for opposing the civil rights act were libertarian essentially there were small government reasons the civil rights act by the way outlaws not only government discrimination but also private discrimination that was goldwater's problem right there now goldwater by the way was a founder of the phoenix naacp he had helped to integrate the phoenix schools he had integrated the arizona national guard he was actually not a bad guy he was not a racist but he had this economic libertarian objection to the civil rights act and he opposed it and as a result he lost the deep he won the deep south but he lost the rest of the country and that's how johnson won a landslide in 1964. now the very interesting thing about this is that richard nixon who came after goldwater learned the lesson of goldwater lincoln nixon contrary to what the left says didn't actually have a southern strategy lincoln had what nixon had what can be called a sun belt strategy nixon realized that the country was changing there was a new urban south that was developing and nixon targeted fl the cities of the south going all the way to the west all the way to nixon's home state of california so nixon targeted in florida cities like tampa houston greenville dallas phoenix san diego this was the nixon strategy not to go for the deep south but to go for the upper south and the non-racist south and that's what nixon won and that's how nixon got got in in 68 and won an even bigger landslide in in 72. let me come now to the present because um we are in a big fight with the other side and the important thing to remember is that they know that we are in general the party of the nice guys they know this and it is their secret weapon it is their secret weapon because they know that we will not do to them what they do to us they know that and they and they count on it they will knock down our monuments they know we won't knock down their monuments they will use the deep state against us they know that when we come in we won't use the deep state against them they'll appoint judges who are nakedly partisan knowing that when we come in we will swear to appoint judges who respect the constitution no matter which way it falls so my message to you as i close is it's time for us to stop being so nice [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i think we've reached a point where we have to demand that these guys be held accountable across the board [Applause] no more wiping out your cell phones and then claiming immunity no more setting things on fire and claiming you're just on fire for justice the republican party needs to become more of a trump party it does for sure the fight needs to be enjoyable for us [Applause] we have to we want to get to the point where when they attack us we like it we like it um the the genius of of trump reagan was sort of above the fray and and there was a value to that because reagan was an actor he could sort of skim over the heads of the media the beauty of trump is that he's in the fray he moves forward [Applause] one little plug if you'll permit me trump card [Applause] i i think it's my best movie yet i wanted to put it in the theater the theaters were actually behind us but they're still closed in a bunch of places and so it was very frustrating that some people would be able to see it and other people wouldn't so basically it's going straight to video on demand but you'll be able to see it on apple itunes or google amazon prime any platform any device your phone your big screen tv and it's a movie that pulls out all the stops it's hard hitting [Applause] let me close by saying that long term we cannot have these huge institutions of academia and the media and the whole entertainment industry and corporate america and sports world we have to start creating our own institutions we have to we have to [Applause] i too use the language of unity we are one america but when you hear the other side and when you see them it's very clear that now when we say the american flag a certain part of us has to grudgingly recognize that it is now our flag and not theirs it's our national anthem and not theirs these are our colors and not theirs they don't want them we can't force them to sing the song we can't force them to salute the troops and so thinking through the implications of that ultimately shows that we are not blessed just the democratic party we are ultimately taking their whole world everything in it and we are saying sayonara we're out of here goodbye thank you very much [Applause] [Music] to go", "ZeBbJQEM248": "yeah I've been very curious and I cover this on my podcast all the time talking about our psychological immune system meaning that we're constantly looking at all these digital toxins we scroll through our phones on social media and then we suddenly start emulating the behavior that we see you know case in point wear a mask save lives now people are suddenly masking their children and won't go outside or an element of that is that you go on social media and everybody's starting to look the same it's like Avatar it's very bizarre and I'm not against people that want to get BOTOX and nip and Tuck I don't personally do it but I was curious if men found this new face that everyone has decided upon to be attractive and boy was I met with so much heat from women I have a close friend of mine who gets Botox she said Candace you're launching a war on us white women how dare you this is what we have to do I realize that some topics Tucker are in fact too sensitive and I would like to apologize to all of my fans and listeners and I will leave your Botox and your filler alone but we should investigate what is happening to Nancy's eyebrows", "8xfRM-TMxKU": "Lexx it is the black exit leave in the policies of oppression waking up to their own ways of thinking

let's take it from the top so as many of you know a video that I published earlier this week which was critical of the black lives matter released list of demands for white people was recently censored by both YouTube and Facebook and later Shadow banned by Twitter and it got me thinking what exactly are the implications here what are these platforms feelings towards african-american speakers like myself my name is Candace Owens and you are watching my vlog series the myth of the the answer is simple really there was only one version of a black person that these platforms are willing to help propel towards fame and notoriety and that is an angry black victim that's right you're an african-american and you are willing to riot make threats against police officers or threatened to assassinate the President of the United States you can be given a platform across any of these social media channels you can even be like that black lives matter leader in Louisville and preach out an entire list of demands or group of one race and you will still not be censored on Facebook YouTube or Google I remember when I first learned about World War two in school I was absolutely baffled and amazed that one man Adolf Hitler could somehow convince an entire nation of people to hate the Jewish religion and its people how could one man inspire a mass genocide attempt how could a country be that easily led and manipulated to a point of a world war now the answer to that question doesn't seem so baffling it is a historical fact that the Germans use propaganda and censorship to control the German people during the reign of Adolf Hitler the Nazi propaganda ministry directed by dr. Joseph Goebbels took control of all forms of communication in Germany newspapers magazines books public meetings and rallies arts music movies and radio viewpoints in any way threatening to Nazi beliefs were censored or eliminated from all media sound familiar for those of you on the outside looking in many of you may think that America is on the brink of a civil war that could not be further from the truth our media is actively censoring everything that is going out of this country and our social media giants are helping them to do that there are millions of Americans out there every day like me that are working hard to get the truth out regarding what goes on day to day in this country and it is not the picture than you guys have been seeing we alongside our president are being censored and edited at every turn for trying to simply get out a message of unity so I invite all of you to watch each and every one of my videos backwards and forwards and tell me if they are worthy of censorship all I have preached is I refuse to be amused by the media to get out a message of division and mass lies I refuse to play a part in the brainwashing that is taking place in this country so as the media works to double down on its claims of division allowing me to work to double down on some of my own I do not live in a racist country I do not hate white people or any group of people based off of the color of their skin for that matter I do not live in fear every day of the re-emergence of white nationalism or the KKK and I'm struggling immensely to understand why anything that I have just said requires censorship while we're talking the people of America do not believe that Vladimir Putin hacked the u.s. election we do not believe that there is some Russian collusion conspiracy story and we know damn well that Hillary Clinton did not lose this election because she was a woman but because she was an awful human being that none of us wanted to see as our president here in America we no longer have freedom of speech we are being censored and we are being suppressed by powers that are much bigger than us who would see to have all of us divided and fighting and living in constant fear I have no idea what they have to gain from this but I can tell you that we are in the midst of an information war in this country Facebook and YouTube and Twitter are not interested in educated black people because educated black people do not help them launch Wars educated black people do quite the opposite they aim for success and they aim for advancement in this society which is everything that they are trying to avoid people are being paid to riots the media is showing up and filming these riots and they are purporting these riots as a constant condition of living in America and as I have told you that could not be further from the truth and it is not just black and white people that they are trying to divide is gay people are just lesbian people it is trans people it is disabled people it is any a group of people that they feel are not mentally strong enough to think for themselves I am strong enough to think for myself and I have no plans of shutting up no matter how much they might try to censor me I never thought that America would come to this and never thought that America would be a country that is living under censorship the media is our enemy Facebook Twitter Google YouTube as a collective whole they think that we are stupid we cannot prove them right how do you control the group of people you keep them divided up against one another you guys can follow me on Facebook on Twitter on Instagram at red pill black if you want to help me continue keeping making these videos please consider and donating to my patreon com account

told that after the civil rights era we were supposed to be free but we're not that's an illusion if we learn the things that we need to know we have the courage to speak up we will arrive at the promised land [Applause] [Music] I was born and raised in Charlotte the solid a little bit everything here you could find urban life you can find country life in Charlotte for almost 13 years now and I wouldn't want to live anywhere else the culture of solid is southern sophistication but you still have the family down-home values but you have a very intelligent minded people [Music] solid knees budget because right now we have people who are more interested in making sure that the black boat stays the way it's been even though policies on here hoping the black community flex it is coming here to break up that monopoly or trying to make you think like victims so you pull that lever 95 percent for one particular party we got to start preaching a gospel of victory over victimization our goal to teach people job skills education help them grow their wealth and all that will help with the affordable housing crisis in Charlotte you're not financially responsible you won't have any money for long the freedoms that we have in this republic come expressly from our responsibility i think Lexie for coming to Charlotte because Lex it is causing younger people be more involved in government issues it's about ideas the ideas will transcend any political party we have forgotten the power of what we really are when you become a minority that ordains to not only think for themselves but to speak for themselves and to remind people I'm not a slave you can't tell me what to think you can't tell me what to do you [Applause]", "NULsIEoyeHU": "all right you guys we all know that the left ruins everything including some of our favorite TV shows and movies that we all grew up on and we were like hey these are great and we love them and then suddenly 30 years later they're like nope it's not good it's bad it's racist it's backwards for example HBO Max pulled Gone With the Wind because of what they said were racist depictions in the film and more recently Tim Burton's Adams family has been deemed racist because the bullies in this series are black so I thought I was going to get ahead of the curve and what I'm going to do today is I'm going to ruin some of my own childhood Classics before the left can get a handle on them Checkmate so let's start Doug do you guys remember Doug oh my gosh I love Doug I watched so much Doug focuses on early adolescent life and the character Doug funny experiences common predicaments while attending school in his new hometown of bluffington well I love Doug so much so I'm gonna ruin it I'm gonna ruin it and the problem obviously first and foremost is the fact that Doug is white no Doug is white that's instantly a problem red flags for days also a problem is that Patty mayonnaise is black Hispanic I don't know what she is but they intentionally made her dress like a thought she has a short skirt and I find that to be very racist as opposed to trying to whitewash her with the blonde hair and naming her Patty it's just it's very problematic next show that I absolutely loved when I was a child Arthur every day when you're walking down the street it's based on the book series of the same name it was created by Mark Brown in 1976 and the show is set in the fictional American city of Elwood Elwood City it revolves around the lives of eight-year-old Arthur Reed and his friends and his family don't forget DW and their interactions with one another and there is obviously a strong emphasis on the educational value of the books and the libraries as well as relationships with friends and family members Arthur is black so I that's not really a problem but you know it's the way he dresses the preppy look he's all proper and he speaks proper English and not ebonics and so it's like finally we got black representation and they took it and they whitewashed it and that is what I'm most upset about there's no reason why Arthur isn't wearing baggier pants or wearing FUBU if that's still a thing it's a problem and I hope that Arthur gets canceled next up is Sesame Street we all know Sesame Street long-running American educational children television series for preschoolers and a pioneer of the Contemporary educational television standard combining both education and entertainment and what is wrong with Sesame Streets Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash can which makes fun of homeless people he probably was on drugs like we all assume that obviously he lives in a trash can and he should have had a safe space where he could shoot up and then that would have been a better education of things that our tax dollars should have gone toward but no the creators of Sesame Street just weren't brave enough to do that and that makes me sick and it's disgusting and I'm glad that we just canceled it Rugrats love Rugrats the show focuses on a group of toddlers Tommy Chucky Angelica Phil Lil their day-to-day lives we know what's going on first and foremost Tommy is white so I feel like we should say that every single time if the lead character is white it's a problem yes they did fit in the black girl Susie and yes she was represented well she was a good character but that doesn't go far enough that's not important right now but the real problem was Angelica because she obviously suffered from White Privilege right she had a rich mom who had a good job and they didn't want to give that to Susie no so she had this tremendous white privilege and she bossed people around yeah cookies again a blonde girl with the pigtails or a little Cynthia doll Cynthia doll would not have looked like that if Angelica wasn't suffering from White Privilege and that is why we are canceling the Rugrats it's done goodbye done next up move it football head Hey Arnold I loved Hey Arnold the show centers on fourth grader Arnold who lives with his grandparents in an inner city tenement you guys know the episode centers on his experiences he was kind of a wild show there's something you should know Harold what I'm crazy and you should never hit a crazy person but I absolutely loved it I thought it was great I loved it so much that I'm going to ruin it because him navigating the urban life doesn't work for me and first and foremost because he's white he is white first and foremost why why the football head cartoon have to be white why couldn't they just make him black and if they did make him black it would have still been problematic because he was living in the hood so what are you saying are you saying that all black people live in the hood like I mean it's like why even create this series it's problematic because there's no way for this series to be white if he's white it's wrong if he's black it's wrong because black people should only be represented in living in rich neighborhoods but dressing the same because you don't want to whitewash them either basically like there's no way to get this series right other than just not allowing it to exist and I feel that my childhood would have been better if it didn't exist because it I struggled internally as a black person with the representation of a black guy living in the projects if you liked Hey Arnold like I'd did it's probably because you're internally a bigot oh okay next up Blue's Clues [Music] the show follows the animated blue spotted dog named Blue as he leaves a trail of paw prints Mail Time here's the mail it never fails it makes me wanna wag my tail but you all know it doesn't make me want to wag my tail the fact that Steve was white why was Steve White and of course they made the dog blue because they didn't have the courage to make the dog black why couldn't we follow a black dog with black paw prints why couldn't he Deliver us into the end and put it all together oh I know why because everything's racist yeah so there you have it I ruined my own childhood I know I'm feeling like Eminem and Eight Mile no tell them something they don't know about me now tell me a childhood thing that you're going to ruin because I already ruined them myself thanks guys now it's time for so long but we'll sing just one more song", "sFtjrQ59zcY": "[Music] don't stop you can do another punch but i won't drop [Music] i've never given up giving up no i'm never giving up giving up [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] cause i'm never gonna [Music] and i know what is [Music] and now without further ado please give a warm welcome to former arizona police officer and radio host brandon tatum what's going on everybody i'm i'm excited to have an opportunity to speak to you guys even though we're locked down in this quarantine so i want to start with a few things uh first and foremost what does blexit mean to me and how do i think it applies to everybody that's watching this first of all i want people to understand that blexit transcends politics transcends what's on cnn and fox news blexit is a lifestyle it is a a waking up from lies and manipulation that have been perpetuated especially on black people in this country so there's four things that i want to talk about i'm going to be very brief and then we're going to open up the q a but four things that i want to talk about that i think can be impactful to every single person that's watching this specifically some individuals that are watching this i believe god has sent me to speak these words to you right so the first thing is family then we're going to talk about faith we're going to talk about patriotism and then visualization so first let's start with family the power of the father is bar none the father being in the household the father being present is tremendously effective and impactful for youngsters growing up and being able to find their value believe it or not and i know mama hold it down trust me i know mama hold it down but it's something about a father's love is something about the masculinity in the household that shows young people how to grow up strong how to grow up with integrity and it works both for male and female because as a young man watches his father he grows up and learns how to be a father how to have integrity how to treat a woman and vice versa you know you have a a young lady who grows up with her father at home she she understands what she should be looking for a good man how should she be treated all of those things are are funneled into the presence of a father and i encourage all of the young brothers out here because we got a whole we we have to hold ourselves responsible for this is that be involved in your kids lives if you can control whether or not you're present in the home then do your best to be present in the home if you find yourself in a situation similar to mine where your son lives with the other parent and you have to share custody do the best you can to be involved as an example i call my son he has his own phone i bought him a phone i communicate with him i text with him i call him on a day-to-day basis i let him talk my ear off about whatever he want to talk about but just those little uh things to really help your children feel your presence even though you can't physically be there let's talk about family name because that's a part of the family don't lose a track of of your family's destiny some people's family name has probably been tarnished uh in the past maybe some people gone to prison done some things that destroyed the family name or made the family name uh be presented or viewed in a negative light it is up to you to carry that legacy it's up to you to carry the family name to restore the family name and a lot of times we see this in other cultures the reason why certain people tend to have generational effects that are positive is because they never leave the idea of building and establishing their family the family name and so what i will present to you guys that are watching and gals is never lose track of that my father told me um more recently i mean i'm 33 years old now my father told me how my grandfather used to tell him about how important it is to be a tatum and just my father saying that to me gave me a extra bump in pride and understanding that i'm not just living this life for myself i'm living it for generations to come my son carries my name my wife carries my name and it's it's in it's invaluable for us to keep that in mind as we move forward um also taking care of what's yours i think that goes back to um the father being in the household and also mama doing what she need to do you know i know that some mothers in the black community are put in in bad positions some some of which is their fault some of it is not their fault you know you deal with a man who's supposed to take his responsibilities and he doesn't do that then you're stuck fending for yourself and doing the best you can but take care of your children make them a priority now that the responsibilities in your lap you need to take advantage of it and do what's best now let me speed this up because i'm taking a long time because i talk to you guys for three hours but i don't have much time so the bottom line of the family is to be responsible let's move on to faith i think as a people black folks we have a tremendous amount of connection in the spiritual realm and i think as of late when it comes to the ideas of the way we vote when it comes to the ideas of the way we view our responsibility in the family has gone away from the traditional values and fundamental values of what we stand for i want people to remember this black folks uh escaped from slavery and had the vision of escaping slavery because of the bible because of the story of moses and so i want us to remember and get back to the spiritual side of things as well understanding that this is not just a flesh and blood battle and the things that we deal with in the united states and our families a business it is a spiritual battle as well so let's let's never forget and let's remain focused on the spiritual side of things patriotism this is a big one for me i made a video the other day on my youtube channel speaking about um the comparison of patriots marching at the capitol with you know with their armor lights and everything and colin kaepernick taking the knee my take away from that mean was i feel that that that we are being pressured to not identify with patriotism not identify with our rightful position in this country this country belongs to us just like anybody else the constitution applies to black folks just like anybody else and when we make the comparison of viewing the white men at the capitol exercising their second amendment rights and we view that as a negative and we view that as being juxtaposed to colin kaepernick a multi-millionaire taking a knee during a football game that that is counterproductive to i believe our psyche and our position in the united states of america don't get it twisted this country was was built in part by black folks and black folks have not always been slaves and even during slavery not every black person was a slave we have a lot of traditional value that we've added to this country and we are in no different position now than then george washington carver all w.e.b du bois all of the people that have established this country and have established who we are way back then we have that responsibility to establish that now uh we have that responsibility to view this country as being us having ownership as well we can make businesses in this country we can become the president of the united states if we want to we should be running for office we should be in law enforcement we should be in in the medical field not just some of us but we should flood these avenues and have representation there and i'm gonna say this because i know a lot of people may think that representation ain't a big deal in that we all are one color and we're just americans but in reality there is a cultural dynamic to it and i think we should realize that and we should put ourselves in position to represent a different cultural value people have a lot of um angst and hard time with some police officers in certain communities but that's why we should be putting ourselves in a position to be in law enforcement putting ourselves in a position that we can at least show a different side to our community or at least be able to understand and show empathy because we come from some of these hoods that we see issues as it relates to the people and the police so i want us to to keep that in our mind of the patriotism in this country ain't just for white folks it's for black folks as well you talk about the parties and i don't want to bring up you know specific parties because that's not what this is about but the original african-american people in this country or african people in this country were a part of the republican party they were active in politics and also black people were a huge part of uh the nra in the inception of the nra and how african-american people were able to have their constitutional right to bear arms and defend themselves so let's not get it twisted we have a right we have a responsibility to be just as patriotic to this country and don't let people lie to you and try to put slavery in front of your face try to put the jim crow south in front of your face to detour you from feeling like this country it belongs to you as well let's go to the last point and i think i i could finish it up with this point visualization now outside of political talk and all of these things it is invaluable ladies and gentlemen and this can go to the faith and if you ain't a christian that you that you can you can apply this in your life as well visualization is important how you see yourself is important what is your projection in your life is important and i'll give you a quick synopsis or a quick example of why i'm saying this and why i believe it's invaluable and important when i was growing up i visualized being a professional football player i visualize every night i would dream about it i i would get my cleats and i'll make them look like my favorite football players cleats and i would visualize my success i had a tree in my front yard it was a big old thick tree and i used to run at that tree juke the tree and if i didn't juke it well i'll hit the tree and i'll be in i'll be hurt so what i would do is practice my skills while everybody else watching tv and i will practice my skills my visualization of me going into the nfl set me on a path of success that led me to being to being an all-american football player in high school playing collegiate football and i was in the 2010 nfl draft now god had another plan for me but my visualization led me to success and led me to meeting individuals that have gotten me to this point but without that visual visualization i wouldn't be here my wife i i some people may remember the speech that i gave about two years ago at a turning point event um it was a young women's leadership summit and i know some of y'all were there and i gave the statement of how i would visualize that i was married i would visualize my wife traveling with me to speaking engagements while i was a police officer i hadn't even been on the tour speaking to anybody i would visualize when i would travel that i was a i was a nationally known speaker and i was traveling to destinations i wouldn't just think i would act right i would tell myself okay i'm going to speak to these people in chicago i'm going to speak to these people in dc and i will visualize it i would prepare myself to speak and when i would have a seat that was vacant next to me i would imagine that my wife was next to me i would close my eyes and envision how we were interacting with each other flying on the airplane now ladies and gentlemen fast forward two and a half years it has come true i traveled around the country to speak uh i met my wife last year we're married and we travel just like i envisioned flying around the country to speaking engagements just like i saw and i want i want to encourage y'all today cause and then i'll get the q a i want to encourage y'all to never let people distract you from your vision never let them distract you from your vision never let them tell you that you're not smart enough or you don't have the background or you don't have the education that stuff is baloney ladies and gentlemen understand this the doors that god can open no man can close and if you are have faith and you have faith like i mentioned before that then you will believe more so in christ's privilege than in white privilege you will believe and have the understanding that it's really up to your relationship with god and what your purpose is that will determine your future then somebody holding you back then somebody being a destructionist in your way of accomplishing your success so i'll end it with that mindset of visualization write it down like the bible say write the vision make it plain take time out instead of watching sports uh get being entertained take some time out at the end of your day to sit and meditate sit and think and visualize when you get up in the morning don't jump on social media and be doing up take some time to visualize your success take some time to be thankful for where you are today and where you're gonna go and i think that would be what i would express to you guys today in a time that i've been allotted um i could say plenty more but it'll take me a lot more time to do that so what i want to do now and and again thank you guys for for watching us thank you guys for participating in the chat what i want to do now is do some q a i want you to ask me the questions we'll pop them up on the screen i'll do my best to read remember i have a public school education so i may not read it that fast no i'll just mess with y'all but uh i'll try to do my best to read your questions and answer them in a rapid fire um way so that i can get more questions so feel free to write your questions we'll try to get them up on the screen as soon as possible so uh the first question what is the hardest thing about being a black conservative uh the hardest thing about being a black conservative for me is the disappointment that i feel when i i'm rejected by other black people it's not so much that i feel like i'm wrong for what i'm doing i just hate the fact that i feel like a lot of black people are lost in entertainment and lost in the leftist mentality and they're so lost to the point where they would even reject another brother just for thinking differently so that's my biggest challenge is just the to getting over not being so disappointed or hurt by the way other black people treat me all right we're ready for the next question all right how do you balance your faith in politics well it's very easy to me because my faith is way up here and then whatever i decide to believe in politically matriculates down from my faith so i don't go and look at okay what does this party say what did this person say i try to look at what does god say what are the standards what what does my morale say and then which party that you know the candidates that are available which one of them are speaking to what my values already are and you my opinion is i'm flexible on them because nobody's going to be perfect but at least i have deal breakers and y'all know the deal breakers i don't want to say it on here because then they'd be banning stuff but y'all know the deal breakers in the faith and if those deals breakers are accompanied or accomplished i cannot go or participate in that candidate's uh campaign all right ready for the next question see what we got and y'all feel free to ask me anything i i ain't holding back um you're very vocal about second amendment rights do you feel like there should be any form of gun control um i'm very leery on any form of gun control because i feel like that it's a slippery slope down the wrong path um but there are some things that that occur in our current condition and laws that i say i'm not too worried about them at this point if you go out and you do something crazy that affects the lives of other people if you know what i'm saying if they have to go to meet jesus because of something you did then you have to do time in jail for it and when you do time in jail for it whatever your sentence um is laid out as when you get out and you have committed a violent crime then i'm not i'm not so far of giving you all of that back because you have proven that you cannot handle what was what was provided for you or you are causing a problem with the other citizens and and and preventing them from exercising their rights right and so i'm not too crazy about just getting rid of people who are prohibited possessors after they have been sentenced for violent crimes if that makes sense i'm trying to avoid saying crazy words to get us messed up on here but those are things that i say okay i understand somebody that's going through a mental crisis and i'm talking about somebody who has been proven through a mental institute and reviewed of having a mental crisis that make them a danger to themselves or others i can see there being a temporary halt on that person having or possessing certain things but they can always restore it once they get to a better a better mindset some people may not agree with me on that but i have seen it in law enforcement and i can see how bad it gets when somebody's become have become troubled especially somebody who's a veteran who have tactical experience it can get really bad but i do think that there's restorative measures that needs to be at the end of that legislation other than that there's no reason to control anything there's no reason to put control on people who are behaving properly or people who are exercising their rights legally and doing it lawfully and respectively and respective of other people i i hope that i said it right and i hope that it came out properly but for the most part i'm not with all of this restriction on magazines and all of that stuff because of the actions of a few other people right somebody go to a school and do something they're not supposed to be doing then they're gonna suffer the consequences i shouldn't suffer the consequences all right i think i answered that enough what's the next question uh do you have any advice for someone who is conservative but reluctant to let others know because of how they'll be treated this is what i will say you got to draw a line in the sand right you got to draw a line in the sand you have to say either i care about what you believe or i'm going to stick by the truth right either i'm going to let people suppress who i really am and the mission that i have either i'm gonna let them suppress me i'm gonna be a free man free woman and think about this for a minute people criticize the heck out of me criticize candace and a lot of other people now just imagine just imagine i did not know that i would make a video and reach millions of people i had no idea i knew that i was opinionated and i know that i'm passionate but i didn't know how far i was going to go with this candice owens didn't know how far she was going to go with it just imagine if she allowed people to distract her or deter her from actually opening up about who she really is imagine where we would be there would be no blexit none of this stuff will exist so you may be an individual that god has got a true talent in and he wants to use you to wake up other people use you to create you know a non-profit or god knows what be the next president of the united states i mean you never know so i would err on the side of saying be true to yourself believe in what you believe stand firm forget what people say and especially if you're a believer jesus did it he went to the cross for it but we're thankful for that you know just imagine if he didn't all right next question all right um in your current political activism what is your greatest achievement i don't know that i i don't even count them to be honest personal i'm gonna say personal achievement and professional achievement my personal achievement is the fact that my father has gone from super left not super left you know not crazy left but typical black man left right my dad has gone from left to now being more right and one of the things he did was he said brandon and this is how i figured it out he said brandon i'm gonna send you a picture uh of something i bought and this is more recently come to find out he bought a second amendment if you know what i'm saying and i was shocked and i and i wrote him i said that's what i'm talking about he said all he wrote me back was second amendment and then we were at a conference that hit him my stepmom and my dad put on talking about voting to a audience full of black people my dad stood up and said i got a question i got a statement to make and i'm thinking my dad is going to disagree with me in front of everybody he come and say that a certain party ain't done nothing for black people and we have given our vote to a particular party way too often and ain't done nothing for us to see my daddy say that all these videos that i've made and all the events that i've invited him to really helps me or makes me feel that that was a great achievement somebody who's stubborn like my daddy to be able to open his mindset up uh a professional that has nothing to do with me directly is when we had uh the young black leadership summit at the white house and 400 or something black leaders from all over the country descending on to the white house we we were in you know like we had it was such a beautiful experience and we've done it two years in a row but that was one of the greatest accomplishments because i felt like that for me i felt so passionate about seeing or at least passionate of seeing all of the young people be able to experience the white house to be able to to see and hear from the president of the united states that was a tremendous accomplishment and i think blexit will be able to supersede that accomplishment here in the future but uh i have to say that that that's pretty much one of my greatest accomplishments next question i probably should rapid fire because i could talk ladies and gentlemen believe it or not okay uh after being a police officer how was the transition to uh civilian life great question man y'all ask y'all ask some great questions um it's been okay i'm gonna keep it 100. if i hadn't been as successful it probably wouldn't have been as easy and let me say it like this financially when you're a police officer you don't make a lot of money i'm not getting a lot of you you're gonna make a lot of money you're gonna check the check and some of that is my fault especially if you're single if you don't you're not married so when i left the police department and i worked for organization um and i was the spokesperson of an organization called uh conservative tribune i mean they paid me so well that it was easier to transition out of that then it would be if i was making the same pay um also the transition has been easier because i feel like that my influence and passion has been able to be broadened so financially that my my influence have been able to be broadened but on the other aspect of it it's still kind of hard to completely transition out of being a police officer because once you're a police officer you never you're never not a police officer right i've had to save people's lives after i left the police department on my first job gave a girl to hamlet maneuver saved her life she was literally dying and i saved her life there's a lady at a rally the other day that passed out i rendered aid to her i mean it just never stops i got a whole bunch of second amendments around my house everywhere and i ain't gonna leave a lot of y'all i'm i'm i'm paranoid man i got cameras everywhere i got a lawn system on my house and i keep that thing next to my bed just so you know but so i there's some elements of transitioning and then there's some elements of i ain't never gonna fully transition out now i say this before i go to the next question i do often uh miss being a police officer i miss going code three likes and sirens i miss chasing people i miss the arrest i miss saving lives i mean literally saving lives not just verbally but physically saving people from jumping off of bridges and all kind of stuff i miss it i miss the camaraderie i miss that i was literally superman with a blue uh uh k-pop on with a badge i mean that's pretty much how police officers feel when you have the ability to save so many people's lives all right next question let's see i don't even know how much time i got but uh we'll knock them out as long as they want me on here uh do you feel that being a police officer influenced your conservative beliefs or do you think your uh latent conservatism led you to be a police officer okay so i can answer that uh okay we can we do one more after this one so let me let me put it in context so everybody know kind of where how i became a conservative i was i got saved first in 2008 i got saved now that led me on the path to open up my understanding that we're all god's children at the end of the day and there's no real beef you feel me there ain't no real beef between black and white and honest it's like no god's children and then whatever else happens and so i was saved first but i wasn't quite conservative because i didn't really know what conservatism is right i thought that left was right if you if you feel what i'm saying so when i became a police officer my policing and my peers and what i saw from barack obama and how he was dissing my profession of people who are i think one of some of the greatest heroes in this country and so all of that kind of led me to being like wait a minute i need to rethink what side i'm on because this ain't this ain't making sense and then also everybody on the police department were conservatives so it's like i would get challenged on a day-to-day basis being like bro you're a christian why are you why are you doing that that ain't matching what you believe oh look at what they doing now look at what they doing now look at these taxes and so all of that kind of led me into becoming more conservative all right we got one more question and then i'm gonna free y'all's spirit of me rambling in the air so we got one more question that we're gonna pop up hopefully this will say the best for last baby say the best for last so let's see one more question we'll wait for them to to put that up there but i'll just say man i think thank you guys for coming on and being committed um to doing this live to coming on and watching this live stream i mean we thought that the message would be somewhat hindered because we couldn't physically meet and and be together and all of that but because of the great staff at blexit then putting together this thing we've been able to to communicate uh let's get one more question in here one more question i'll make it quick uh if y'all can pull one more person in okay how do we get this information into our schools great question i mean you probably asked my question it's very hard to um all right let me let me put it this way somebody told me the other day about good people like you and i running for office you know there's a school superintendent there is mayor that there is there is governor there there's a lot of position that you can infiltrate and have influence right and when you have influence then you can start to to make things happen from the top down also being participants in your children's school because the young people they can speak up but it's gonna have to be an adult that comes and say i don't agree with the the rhetoric that's being taught in the school you know i don't think it's so it's right that you told my son or my daughter that they couldn't do this they couldn't do that those are things that we could do on the parental level because i'm a parent and if i have a problem my son in school i'm going up there and i'm talking to him but on a parental level because some of y'all watching probably are parents parents need to step up and take that position and challenge the school challenge the curriculum and then parents and some of you young people that aspire to grow up and be politically active you need to take up these roles when they have the superintendent position available when they have a city council available then you need to be infiltrating in those positions so when grants come out or when you know they're deciding on the state whether or not they want to use common core you know you can be in a position to uh put us or put our children in a better spot now i'm talking more elementary now when you get to college you're on another level and that's very difficult man it's very difficult because it may take a generation to get this fixed because while we were being these good old conservatives and relying on good faith the left was infiltrating the school infiltrating the profession of being a professor of education and then they were putting in their indoctrination and then they started indoctrination for generations for at least one generation they've been indoctrinated so in order to reverse that we may need some people to start applying four percent professional jobs start getting active in certain organizations um i can say turning point is one of them at this point they already have active positions where people are able to be elected to government positions on campus um not necessarily federal government positions but government precision on campus where you control the budget and different things like that so find an organization that you can be a part of that can accelerate you to positions of power and influence um on a college level that's what you can do and whenever possible push back against your teachers man don't just lay down there and take it um be smart because you're paying your top dollar to go get an education maybe some fights ain't worth fighting and you can fight it on on the back end but if you have an opportunity don't be afraid of criticism don't be afraid to stand up for what you believe um especially if it don't get you kicked out of school stand up for what you believe and if we start powering up as a team it'll be less less likely that people bully us it'd be less likely that people bullying you on campus if there's 20 people uh claiming to be conservative or supporting the president of the united states or whatever your position is the more there are of you the more these cowardice people begin to shrink so that's the best answer that i have at this point i think i covered a few areas there um i think that that should be it i love you guys i appreciate it thank you for watching continue to support blexit continue to uh show up to these live streams there's a lot of other speakers that are going to be involved in this that are just as dynamic or probably more dynamic than myself so i love you guys thank you see y'all tomorrow peace", "9EbVYXfsOX0": "I tell people that don't realize my socialism is they means that everybody owns your paycheck we put it in one pot we share the money so it doesn't matter how hard you work or how little you work is all gonna be you know whatever is put in the pot now let's say somebody is working very hard and they're making a lot of money like well what does it matter who I work as hard they're gonna stop working les inventions aren't gonna be made let's say everybody start working till one day you know where your inbred lines and you're talking about Soviet Union which is which is socialism and communism are cousins my parents they're immigrants are from from Nigeria we know what a real socialist state we know real corruption the great thing about capitalism you have a choice and other people will share what makes them happy or what how they've gotten to where they've gotten you know together so that encourages free thought like various different ideas in America you do have that opportunity [Applause] you [Music]", "Bfi1JpTSuYA": "so this is REO take one I'm pumped I'm pumped yeah I'm ready in my opinion I think that blech say could finally be the thing that sets apart the black community within America because for a long time the Liberals speak for blacks they say oh they can't handle this they need help and they need assistance and we need to keep them down and then Republicans for a long time we're not speaking out enough in favor of black people and so it was you know blacks had to kind of just sit back and watch these two groups just battle it out for their votes well I think that this is going to be a thing for us to rise up and say hey we are a huge part of this nation and we don't believe what everybody else wants us to believe we did get to dictate what we believe and it's not about winning the black vote it's just gonna be winning the vote period anymore and I'm really excited about that [Music]", "QZbyTj4D-IE": "all righty so right take your seats we're gonna get started here with a very quick second half hope you guys got some water some t-shirts everybody got a t-shirt there we go can't wait to see all these clips I love this so much alright so there's a lot that is gone on every day I wonder if the news can possibly be real and it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier my favorite I always say that um I'm a little fast out of the gate so I'll make a I'll make an assumption or I'll say something and people like Oh Candace you can't say that you're about to say that one of my favorite tweets a tweet that aged so well at age like a fine red wine when somebody sends a tweet to me I was I was flying on a plane and they say hi Candace I noticed that you're saying unusually silent on the jussie Smollett scandal don't you feel bad for him and this was right when he came out with the story before he did his interview and I replied and I said I'm more likely to believe that AOC is gonna win an award in economics one day than I am to believe that in a polar vortex in Chicago someone decided to pick up some bleach and a rope and and and look for a gay black man and that they said this is mega country I'm gonna do a lot of magno events I've never heard anybody say this is mega country seem a little too absurd obviously I was right but a bigger question that it brings to me is what's happening in the Hispanic community what's happening in the black community is also very much happening in the LGBT community they are looking at the LGBT community and they're going to try to to harness them to go after their political opponents so I met this next person who has just been such a great defender of mine and I just saw him speak and I said oh my gosh he was a veteran I first read his story I'm a daily mail a gay black veteran who had to come out and say that he was a conservative I want him to tell you his story and his perspective I'm on what is echoing throughout the LGBT community first just a video so you guys me as used to him I think Democrats use identity politics to keep people online to keep black people online to keep Latinos in line to keep gay people in line I'm black and gay and I've seen them use the same tactics for black people as they do for gay people the media is drunk on the president they are drunk on Donald Trump anything that they can possibly say to make this administration appear negative or racist or anything like that they go for it Don Lemon went from an anchor at CNN to the chief overseer on the Democratic plantation what they're doing is they're trying to send a message to any other black American to any other black conservative that supports the president that this is what we will do to you if you are vocal about that support what we hear every day from people who don't support the president is that he you don't get support from white supremacist white nationalists etc you I was in a room full of hundreds of young black conservatives that did support the president for you to call it a minstrel show you were doing what every other black person is doing right now to anybody who dares to expel you did you just did it and Kanye West talks about a lot of different things he talks about the relationship between black people in the police he talked about basically supporting the president he talks about making America great right now I've lost friends since coming out as a Republican visible do not understand it and these are the the left that's supposed to be so tolerant and so inclusive you know and these are the people that were the first to shun me when I came out as conservative Oh you we have small actually okay well you were just insulting what he's voting for the same party for decades and having nothing to show for what you want to do if you want to make it so controversial for any black person to have anything to do with this administration Trump derangement syndrome and I think it is terminal I think that they want to push out anything better thinking up about this person because they know it gets wet I will tell you and I will tell you Trish if I thought for a single solitary moment that the president of United States hated me for being black or hated me for being gay because I am both I would never have gone to that event I never would have gone to that lecture now this right here this this is my country am i right so let me ask you a question and I'm going to ask you if you have heard these two statements before January 29 did you ever hear Mogga country before in your life no did you ever hear the name justice mullet before in your life all right so it's not just me but you know I'm a black gay guy I knew who he was um any black gay guy who's been on television there's like ten of us so we all know who each other are so on Daniel ameet let me take you back to to the great hate crime hoax of my generation okay on January 28 in the dead of winter at 2:00 a.m. in Chicago allegedly this gay black millionaire actor from Empire wanted to go out and get a sandwich because seamless doesn't exist apparently so he was accosted by these two white rednecks and make America great again caps and they said this is Mogga country pour bleach on him tied a noose around his neck right so this is the story that came out in the media this is the story that came out and I remember reading it the very first day it came out and I barely believed it at first but by the time I got through the first sentence I really didn't believe it but I was like okay let me sit back and see how this plays out because there were so many things about this alleged hate crime that played into a lot of the biases that the left-wing media has right because they want to make you think that the America the make America great again cap is just like the Ku Klux Klan hood correct they want you to make they want you to think that everybody that wears that cap is some sort of white racist redneck and I said let me sit back and watch what happens and man it exploded everybody reporting you got the Washington Post New Year Post The Daily News CNN MSNBC everybody reported this but what they did was say they said Oh cording to TMZ because that's who originally reported right timsy is a gossip blog right so you see this story flying around and not only are people shoddily reporting it there are the people who are the professional victim class of the left and now these are the people that are professional victims right their entire identity is around being a victim because they're black or because they're gay or they're both and so they're running around so the daily of The Daily Beast and they're running around to all these people and they're saying that this makes me feel more afraid to be in America because I know that the people that wear this cap don't support me I know that they will beat me up on the streets I know that they will Lynch me on the streets right so this is what they were saying and I'm gonna give you a sense of why that image is so powerful and why this is able to keep on going back and forth you know in our society especially among people that are black or gay or both like me it's because there is an entire culture of people who look like me who have my same sexual orientation that want to be victims it gives them life it gives them purpose victimhood is currency in 2019 in America and these people are trying to get a check alright no you look at victimhood being currency and you think about it so you think about Jesse Smollett right and you think about young good-looking millionaire Hollywood actor why would he want to lie about this why would he want to create a hate crime hoax first of all because he wants to divide America and the main thing that the leftist used to divide America is that cat that a lot of you are wearing in this building right now and let me tell you something that cap doesn't tell me fear that cap shows me love for America shows me love for this country so what's going on in Candace said it before what's going on with the left and in how they targeted blacks and the left and how they've targeted Latinos it is the same thing with gays and lesbians in America right now because gays and lesbians are the new victim class right we're the new group of victims in America right now and let me tell you a little bit about my backstory in case you guys don't know who I am on my road to becoming what I like to call America's favorite black gay Republican no funny right yeah you can laugh it's okay this is that this is a safe space so the mesh of the Sousa told a story early and he was absolutely dynamic that was my first time having the privilege to see him so he told the story about the ladder and the Rope right and looking back on that I realized that I climb the ladder so let me tell you a little bit about myself I was born and raised in Akron Ohio alright hi oh hi this is a Midwest guy right Midwest guy and and everybody likes to think that that black Republicans that we come from some sort of wealth or some sort of privilege and that is not my story my story is the story of somebody that came from a broken home from Akron Ohio that went to one of the worst high schools in the city right that decided at 17 years old out of love for a country out of out of need for a better life out of a lot of different things to join the military so that's what I did at 17 years old I joined the military I joined the US Army infantry all right US Army infantry I was fourth ID all right 11 Bravo 4th ID hardest job hillside how behind it to do over again I probably would have done the air force that have been easier but I digress so I joined the army the u.s. army infantry served next to people of different races different you know actually I didn't serve across from people from different genders because I was in virgi which is all-male but I served with people from different races and I served with people that have different religions and I was exposed to all of these people that were different from me all right because I was born and raised in Akron Ohio black high school black family like everything was black by black and so I was exposed to these people that were different from me other black people other white people other Latino people and what brought us together was this love for country robotis together was a love for America and so when I see people wearing the make America great again a hat and when I see people chanting USA and when I'm around people that love this country I know because I was with people that served that still loved the country right and so what's going on with the left right now when it comes to gays and lesbians LGBT whatever you want to call it what's going on with gays and lesbians right now is that the Democrats see them as another victim group right they see them as another group of people that they can make afraid they say oh you should be afraid of the people wearing the Mokka caps you should be afraid of Donald Trump you should be afraid of the Republican Party I say no the biggest thing that I should be afraid of right now as a gay man is radical Islamic terrorism because those are the people that killed 49 gays and lesbians in polls Orlando which is one of the biggest terrorist attacks in American history and that's my red pill moment right my red pill moment was when I woke up and I saw what happened at pulse Orlando and I saw that forty nine gays and lesbians were killed by a terrorist okay and I was I was a good little lefty at the time of course I was black and gay I could never be a Republican right so of course I was a liberal and I waited for Democrats to say something because I thought that they were gonna protect me and I realized that Democrats weren't interested in protecting me as much as they weren't interested in protecting the feelings of certain people so they weren't gonna protect me and what I was looking for that forceful condemnation of radical Islamic terrorism I found that from the Republican Party I found that from Republicans and it's not even that terrorism thing think about it and one of the great gifts of being involved in this movement is that I've started to think of so many different things in so many different ways and think about Second Amendment rights think about gun rights I believe that gun rights are gay rights and gay rights are gun rights because if there are so many hate crimes going on across the country why would I not want to be able to protect my so I don't want to give away that right to protect myself but this is what is going on on the left right now to the point where you have people that actually survived the post terrorist attack becoming gun control advocates because they are so warped into that way of thinking and I feel so privileged to have been able to talk to people like Maj Tory and to be able to talk to people from the Second Amendment community and I'm miss shooting I was really good at it was a extra marksman I actually really miss my saw I saw a machine gun that I took to Iraq when I was there help keep me safe but what I realized throughout this entire process and I get slammed by people there is no group that has been worse to me then other gay people especially gays and lesbians on the left because they are very caught up in sort of that idea of the victim mentality that idea of victimhood as currency but I am getting so many amazing signs that gays and lesbians across the country are waking up not only how open and welcoming the conservative community has been to me as a gay man but in going to CPAC and being wrong people like Rickey rebel who were the Trump jacket on the red carpet and being around Brandon Straka who was another openly gay man who did the walk away campaign and being around all of these people and what I realized that we're doing is we're making it safe for other LGBT people to wake up just like Brandon Tatum and in Candace Owens and everybody else including me because I'm gay and black are making it safe for black people to wake up all right and I want to tell you this and and I'm gonna wrap this up because we're going a little behind there's a lot of great speakers but I want to tell you that when I look when I when I think about that term Mogga country I think about like what that means like what is Mogga country because you know Jesse's got a say in it now so he introduced us to this this new thing in the lexicon so we say what is Mogga country because to me Mogga country is the country that I live in that I'm proud of because it is a country that a gay black boy from Akron Ohio can rise the ladder can go serve his country and be anything that he wants to be that's my country Baga country Mogga country is a place where I can be in the room with people that are black and white and Latino and gay and straight and whatever and we are united in Mogga country because we are united and in love for this country we are united in a love for America USA so I got a message for Jessie small and I got a message for every gay and lesbian and whoever who wants to go around here being a professional victim to try to tear me down for being a proud black gay Republican that this is Mogga country this is the country that I believe in this is a country where people of all races genders sexual orientations ethnicities religions can come together because we love America we love this great nation and we're gonna make sure that this continues to be Mogga country through 2024 and beyond thank you very much thank you", "nK3WX0yxYHg": "a lot of people's initial reaction is oh well Republicans are racist or conservatives are racist and you can't say that to me can't look in me in my face is anti-racist I grew up in a very rural town in North Carolina when I went to college I wanted to expand my mom so I wanted to join the Black Student Alliance and start you know reaching out and making friends with people who were you know I thought like me based on just simple the color of my skin I was not accepted at all because I was a conservative and that was a very hard thing for me to learn especially as a bi-racial person in a minute right now in America I felt like I was too white for the black kids and too black for the white kids and to have this movement be sprung up Candis Owens my goodness I cannot thank her enough how incredibly eloquent she was and I was said that's everything that I think and that's how I feel and I want to be a part of that [Music] you", "_m-SXfsVtV0": "there is not a single particle that we agree on left and right there's nothing I mean if you actually think that children should be taught pornography in school tell me what the middle ground is there tell me where we're going to go okay you know what let's unify here like we're in couples counseling here right no you have to be my child to be able to twerk and pick their gender and be sexualized at kindergarten you say no I think that maybe the child should grow up tell me what the middle ground is no there's no mountains I don't think it's I think that that's actually a very sensible discussion to have yes I understand it's not going to be easy but clearly trying to unify the country is not very easy and it's equally as violent how many people are dying in Black lives matter protests antifa protests where we'll act like the violence is not happening right now today", "aIopYNSdCmI": "um we got to talk about Hollywood obviously we need to talk about Hollywood it is cancerous it's infested it's infected I actually personally can't stand being in LA ai land and I can feel it's a godless it's a godless city it really is you can feel it soon as you land there but they don't believe in God they don't believe in anything but themselves they're all narcissists they are there are celebrities are narcissists I mean they know absolutely nothing they're hypocrites they live in gated communities and tell us that we can't have a wall okay well can I come to your house no no no we're saying that we need to everybody in the country but no one's allowed into my house it makes no sense they say that we shouldn't have our two-way rights but they all travel with armed security right at all times of the day so Hollywood is important topic for us to talk about and I want to introduce you guys Jerome Hudson he is an editor for breitbart.com and he just recently wrote a book he's gonna talk to you guys a little about what Hollywood means in this era of Trump please welcome to the stage Jerome Hudson bleh [Applause] begging you please keep it going [Applause] [Music] look at this beautiful crown give yourselves a hand please please I came here today to share with you some great news the left in America is losing and it is all because of the sacrifices of the courageous Patriots in this room today you see I realized a long time ago but I think each and every one of you here believes Hollywood and the establishment media are terrified of you and they should be so today we send the leftist plantation of message they don't own us and they never will before we get started please let us hear it for the amazing Candis Owens we are so blessed to have her help lead this movement for freedom not only does she not run from the leftist mobs but she runs toward them as it was mentioned I do have the great privilege to serve as the entertainment editor at Breitbart news you know our founder Andrew Breitbart famously said that politics is downstream from culture now what does that mean well it means that popular culture drives politics not the other way around take gay marriage Will and Grace had a lot more to do with creating the climate for gay marriage than any politician or the transgender movement Caitlyn Jenner popularized transgender politics way long before any member of Congress think about your family your friends the celebrities that they follow on social media pound their heads daily with leftist messages it's why your voice on social media is so important you have a megaphone in your pocket that empowers you to fight back long before the social media movement in America exploded Andrew Breitbart used to hold up his phone at rallies just like this one and tell the audience to harness their power as citizen journalists so you're a more powerful than you realize and so the establishment has to silence you you see they know that you're dangerous because you're a vocal and so to the elites who believe that they can muzzle and manipulate the voices for freedom in this room we say this we will not be silenced you know people asked how a kid like me from Savannah Georgia became conservative yes I know see unlike you I didn't have a plexi movement to open my eyes instead I had books by the great Thomas Sol people like Shelby still John McWhorter Angela McGowan and Larry elder you see what I quickly began to realize is that everything that I have been told was a lie I realized that Barack Obama and Maxine Waters al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson were all victimhood vendors you see they said America was racists they said capitalism was racist they said personal responsibility was racist help everything was racist and so till the race hustlers we say this you had your chance you did not tell the truth and now we will today people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and Alexandria Acacio Cortez yeah they claim to speak for us but that's not happening not on our watch because we believe in an America that puts its citizens first not last we believe in an America that offers its people a hand up not handouts then we believe in an America where citizens shape their own destinies not globalist elites who put their left-wing agenda before the needs and the values of working Americans but Hollywood and the establishment media do not like that Samuel Jackson Don Lemon Don Cheadle Spike Lee Van Jones and Jesse Smollett all think that we should sit down and shut up and by the way anybody taking their political cues from Jesse's maleta needs to have their head examined twice yes but see they think they own us they think we're too stupid to think for ourselves that's why they attacked me and Breitbart news you see every day as entertainment editor I hold up a giant mirror over lala land and I ruined Judd Apatow and Lena Dunham and Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lawrence's Google search results because they hate being held accountable for their horrible words and deeds but that doesn't stop them from lecturing us now does it you see Hollywood lectures us about our carbon footprint while they fly around the world and carbon spewing private jets Hollywood preaches feminism while the land of Harvey Weinstein brutalizes women they tell us that guns are evil but that doesn't stop them from making millions by featuring guns in their movies they want our Second Amendment rights destroyed while they walk around under the protection of armed bodyguards see these elites want the voices for freedom in this room silenced and suppressed both on your social media and on your college campuses but today we have a message for them you can try to hold us down but you will never shut us up they say we are in the sunken place but it is the left-wing Hollywood that's in the sunken place it's also why they launched blacklisting and boycotting campaigns against Breitbart news a newsroom that according to the New York Times has a fanatical advocacy for Israel Breitbart news is a newsroom that according to the New York Times is not the alt-right and it's a newsroom at Breitbart according to the New York Times that has a good track record of promoting minorities and women to positions of power especially when compared to the abysmal track record of the establishment media but despite all that left-wing Hollywood actor Don gee you know what John Cheadle wants to ruin my career he wants to destroy the lives of the people the patriotic people I have a blessing of calling colleagues see Don Cheadle appeared on NBC's Saturday Night Live last weekend wearing a t-shirt that read protect trans rights but on Don Cheadle's head he wore a hat with the logo for sleeping giants the far left political organization that has launched harassment boycott and black listing campaigns against Breitbart news and Fox News you see that is why Andrew Breitbart called this award because the price we pay for daring to publish Don Cheadle publicly wishing for President Donald Trump to die in a grease fire is that he shows up on NBC promoting a left-wing organization whose sole purpose is to destroy and lie about Breitbart news we'll listen up Don Cheadle it's not gonna happen we're not going anywhere we will be right here exposing the truth about your beloved Democrat Party the Democrat Party that wants to push through a 93 trillion dollar green New Deal scheme to destroy America the Democrat Party of afterbirth abortion and the Democrat Party that wants to drag us back to a my arrow Parvati before Donald Trump came along and ushered in the lowest unemployment rate for black and Hispanic Americans in the history of America no Don Cheadle you will not silence this black man this movement for freedom has gone global and we are putting you on notice we are not backing down so what is blex its role in all of this and how can you all help free more minds I have three suggestions first of all love and support each other's journeys connect and mobilize in your communities and on social media support each other and cheer each other on and remember as Candis Owens always says they can't call us all Koons second no the facts I'm going to plug again my publication Breitbart news but I do encourage you to follow and read conservative media arm yourselves more importantly with the informational weapons to win debates and lastly as bright Andrew Breitbart said be happy warriors I'm gonna tell you personally there is nothing that pisses off the left more than a happy white brown or black a conservative activists have fun on social media but then spar but do it from a smart perspective and we always remember what history taught us long ago that evil wins when good people remain silent in closing I am reminded of that famous moment in history during the Civil War right after Lee surrendered at Appomattox Abraham Lincoln was walking with a black troop of Calvary on their way to Richmond and newly liberated slaves were so overjoyed that they began to kneel at Lincoln's feet in Abraham Lincoln the first Republican president in American history he looked to them and he said do not kneel to me kneel only to God and thank him for the Liberty you will hereafter enjoy we are free free indeed and so Lincoln's message then is my message today raza stand tall trust in God and live free thank you and God bless you [Applause]", "9l6-mvVtj5s": "the opportunity that we have here not just as black Americans but as Americans is something that I think we have never had in this country we have an opportunity to to unite honestly it sounds like it's left or right at the end of the day if we can start having these conversations and if you're brave enough to go look into the comment sections of my Instagram post on my Facebook posts is people are fighting but they're also starting to think they're starting to understand that they don't have to be a monolith you don't have to think a certain way because you're a lesbian or because you're gay or because you're white with blonde Terror because you're black you're allowed to actually think your own thoughts irregardless of any of that and that's what people are starting to understand they're starting to research the facts and to form their own opinions so I say people all the time what I always wanted to do was launch an ideological Civil War in the black community I wanted people to fight I wanted them to debate I wanted them to say you know I'm not a victim", "GNnG9KYB0_E": "they've upgraded and they're gonna start to fight hats so this next speaker love to talk about people name is Mike I attea and I want you to see a little bit about what he does so what do you think about when you see maybe a Hispanic or some from the Latino community wearing this hat or maybe some from the african-american community wearing this hat what do you think about that well I think those people are probably stupid just as anyone wearing that hat is probably stupid in the sense that and I don't mean stupid in a disrespectful way I mean like they don't have the information that is required to like for much honest opinion I guess because the thing that maybe you don't think that they're smart enough to maybe come to a conclusion that maybe they should support the president no I don't think so what do you think when you see maybe a Hispanic or an african-american wearing this hat just wanna call attention to something that they don't actually believe in or actually know the basis of so you don't think that they might actually have legitimate reasons for supporting the president or you think it's just maybe they're doing it for attention yeah like a shock factor even if you're Republican I feel like you don't have to support him to be honest some people say that the KKK hood that this is the new KKK hood what's your thought when you hear that no I don't think that's comparable at all why is that bro like KKK it's bad I could wear this on Halloween like that's a joke you can't joke about KKK so so I've heard that before but people have said that the man I make a great make America great again hat is the new KKK hood do you agree with that I think so I mean it's like the same thing like they're representing the same different things just a different color what a special time to be alive guys please welcome to the stage Mike ayats you uh [Applause] [Music] alright are you guys doing so uh yeah that's that's what I experienced basically when I go on college campus is not any of you students specifically black students it's very fun I always say that integrating black girls they give the best answers because you see stuff like that so just a little background I mean my full name is Lu so Michael yeah - uh I'm the son of immigrants I'm from Nigeria as I'm wearing was anyone else offended by what we'll was wearing like nah I'm just kidding I gave it to him I told him to wear he didn't want to wear but my parents met here in Texas before my dad moved to LA because he got a job and growing up my parents emphasized very specific things they emphasized getting education listening to your parents and not being a victim I think God for my mom because she was a Christian growing up and I would go and to see the narratives outside in the world and come back and see the narratives that she was giving so when Candace always says things like I am a victor not a victim you know I knew that from from a very young age because when it comes to Christianity if you're a Christian in here the idea of being a victim does not fit with the left so as I was saying whenever I you know talk to college liberals there's very specific narratives that is given one of them is that like you just saw black conservatives are stupid or uneducated for wearing the famous red hat and that doesn't really make sense you know and these things are being taught on college campuses you know I always say that outrageous taught and is taught on our universities you know it's not being taught necessarily by their parents or anywhere it's being taught by these professors a little story is me and will way it went to a university and will decide to just as another character this time was an indigenous person and you know the person was telling him that obviously he was appropriating their culture but guess what a university professor brought her entire class of 30 students to come out and harass us and tell them that me and will were racist for what we were doing that teacher is teaching her students that another one is when people talk about you know obviously a Democratic Party when you look at the mainstream media the Democrats are always heralded as you know these good moral people and Republicans always Herald it as you know evil sinful people you know but when you bring out facts and tell them well okay did you know that the Democrats started the KKK and that Republicans where the reporting party was founded in response as anti-slavery party and goes right over the head they don't want to listen to it I was talking to a black gentleman and I was trying to explain this to him he was trying to tell me the truth are conservatives I said okay please tell me your assumption on what you know about conservatives and he said that you know the Republican Party was created and I said i interject and I says to stop slavery and he was like I can't have a conversation with you anymore I was like why not he's like because there's obviously something wrong with you I what's wrong with me I'm a conservative and he's a liberal and that's the typical thing that happens when you talk to black liberals on college campuses they don't want to talk to you luckily I do my best to hide my values not in the sense where I'm afraid of them but you know as I just want to get answers like that as you say in the video and that people talk you know people think that we make them look stupid but only you can make yourself look stupid so it's talking to another black gentleman and this is another narrative issue on college campuses and we're trying to explain to them how conservative students on college campuses are repeatedly being attacked assaulted for wearing a hat in fact I saw a daca recipient supporting Trump and another Hispanic liberal chick came and smacked it off his head you know and he was like you just assaulted a daca student that you're probably you know saying we need to protect you you just assaulted me but she didn't care and I was trying to explain this to this gentleman and he was like I've never seen that I don't believe you I've never seen that and I said well maybe it's just because it's a narrative that you're either ignorant to or you're refusing to acknowledge and you said no that's not that's not what it is and this is how it is especially in the black community and just all communities there are narratives out there that if you're not actively trying to find it you're going to stay in your little echo chamber and this is a problem of conservatives house sometimes you know I was like well you know let me try and see what other people are saying but it's a serious issue on the left and that's why you see only one narrative always been pepper traded perpetrated within it and essentially his response to me was okay conservatives are being attacked on college campuses well black people are being killed I was like what okay I guess but aren't you just you know jumping jumping subject it's like saying it's like telling your kids there's kids in Africa so eat your vegetables you know it's a red herring you're avoiding the subject and he didn't want it he don't want it he didn't want to acknowledge that he's like no I'm not no I'm not it's like that's black people being killed I wish those all those happen to black people black people being murdered in the streets so yeah but we're talking about college conservatives being attacked on universities that was the subject but all the saying you brought in black people now we're talking about black people and that's another thing to the black liberal everything is about white people oppressing blacks and blacks being victims that's the entire narrative the black community which doesn't fit so I want to talk a little bit about narratives I believe that blacks should be hearing a narrative I really think is important is that for me as a Christian my identity is not in my skin color it's not in my gender it's not my sexual orientation it is in Christ and that's it and you guys have probably heard the same skin focus not kinfolk yeah that's true skin focus not kinfolk but kinfolk will always be Christ folk and I'm sorry if I'm walking in the middle if I'm walking at night I live in Hollywood Boulevard and it's you know it's very dangerous I've literally seen a homeless person be stabbed by some Hispanics it's like whoa what's going on if I'm walking and I see some sketchy dudes and they happen to be black I'm going to other side of the street yeah I don't care who I don't care who you are I don't know you like why you're you have my best interest because we have the same melanin like that doesn't make sense the left wants you to idolize the most the left wants what you idolize most to be the most important thing about you which it can be your skin color your gender sexual orientation that's why it's always about women's rights it's always about you know blacks rights Black's be depressed it's always about you know some minority being oppressed somewhere but if you're a Christian your foundation is in Christ and not your skin color your general rotation your sexual sexual orientation because where are you going at the end of the day what's important to the believer at the Edit a what's important to the believer is when I die I'm gonna be an eternity with my god and what happens after that when you have that understanding it doesn't matter what skin color you are what gender you know they're attacking Mike Pence right now cuz he says he's the most anti gay person it's like this guy doesn't say anything but they're just bringing all sorts of things that he's said and done it's like this man's most quiet man ever the guy ever has anyone heard him say a word I don't know like but he's you know and it's just funny to me because it's like this man is the most he's one of the most respectful people ever he refuses to have to be alone with women who are not his wife why why why would he do that why would he do that I don't know maybe because you know the left is after any man and we'll you know hey this guy sucks to be assaulted me is like prove it I'm I the only woman I've ever been with is my wife like that's how it is that's a smart move why does he believe that because he's a Christian so I have a Bible verse it's Galatians 3:28 it says there is neither slave nor free there is no male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus I think if the left understood this and took it in to the core of their souls I think they wouldn't have anything to complain about I think all their problems were not that their problems would disappear but their problems wouldn't be the most important thing about them we all have problems everyone has suffered everyone has suffered but to the left black people suffer more obviously lastly the reason why I think that the narrative that the left is perpetuated on the black community one I think it's extremely toxic because if you're like me or will--we or anyone that you know we go to these protests we go to college campuses and we're talking to these students you know we're seeing these people being very active politically protesting everything Trump says or breathe and it's a very negative energy extreme negative energy I used to have I used to have a hard time when I first started doing this I had a hard time being a protest is a very negative energy I'm a very carefuly guy I don't like you know having that energy around me and I tell people I try to explain to this guy I said if someone came to me and called me the n-word if I react I'm giving that person power and a lot of times on the left they think they need to react to everything and in reality when you react to everything that way that sounds like control you're letting other people control you that's it's like why do we say you know these euphemism we're tall black said you know the black exit you know there's no there's no strings on me you know it's like I'm not chained down you know it's like I've left the Democratic plantation why do we use phrases like plantation because when you adhere to ideologies that force you to constantly have some type of negative energy constantly you need to react to everything everyone always says that is control you're not in control of your own life at that point and when you try to explain to people it's like I don't know I don't know I don't know what you're saying you know I think we need to react you know people are suffering I need to be outraged that's what I need to do but dr. King said this I have decided to stick with the love-hate is too great a burden to bear and there are people who truly believe that they need to bear the burden of hate when that is not a reality and I think that conservatives need to adopt that principle of instead of adopting hate we adopt love and we continuously be loving you know I tell people that the most hey I've seen it's not from white people you know it's like white people are my favorite people I tell people that I love white people seriously I love white people my roommates are white we'll whit's white like it's the best but but if we stick to love it doesn't matter what race you are where you come from if you're gay straight black female male female whatever you're gonna love that person you're gonna treat them respectively and I think that I think the conservative movement is doing that thank you guys [Applause] [Music] alright guys so coming up we always do a little intermission for a couple of reasons at first it's gonna be 30 minutes and we want you guys to talk to each other we also in the back have a booth you guys know I work with Turning Point USA and we are doing this fall the biggest black conservative DC weekend's ever and if you are someone that needs financial help to get there we want you there no matter what go to the back sign up we will we will get you there there's gonna be a big show of patriotism ultimately I also want to say one quick thing the most important and effective way to communicate a message I always believe is through art that's why we put together that video that's why

walk you into this intermission with a nice little video that we put together called and still I rise enjoy you may write me down in history with your bitter twisted lies you may chide me in the very

back to life y'all we need this kind of inspiration so god bless america and god bless blexing i was telling someone this feels like america what it should be right feels more like what it's not black lives matter and all of that right this is the america that like people my age grew up to we remember this and candace was referencing that this is what the next generation needs to see because they've never been exposed to america the free how do we keep by the way that's alright she said that's a wrap she said that their interview was over oh wait she didn't rapped on us oh man she didn't spit it how do you think we get there though i mean obviously we have blacks but what else should we be doing to get there how can we bring back the america you grew up in it is each one reach one honestly we have organizations to guide us charge us up give us the camaraderie we need but everybody needs to meet their neighbors they need to have these conversations because guys you are the ones who are on the front lines we're on the front lines in our community you're on the front lines and yours and if you don't have the courage to step across that sidewalk shake hands with your brother or sister elbow bump if you have to but speak truth we're never going to see this reach the momentum it needs to reach our children i'm a teacher our children are too valuable we used to say our children were the future if you really believe that then you've got to reach somebody who doesn't understand what it means to be a patriot in america god bless you lisa god bless you god bless you wasn't she incredible y'all we're not going to top that probably we're going to try we're going to try ariel uh we want to get our national assistant director on camera look at this a fantastic woman she's let

these i know we working together but tell the folks tell the folks so the basic it's it's a lot of work but it's also just the most fun thing in the entire world i think that my favorite part is working with all of the individuals bringing everybody in from all of our 20 chapters and making sure that we have the time to interact with each other and we train them and but we have a good time we're a family and that's my favorite part how important is it to have these type of events because it's been a while since we had the last one why are these needed oh it is a ridiculous it's ridiculously important because we i mean as a society we've been cooped up for months on months and months and it's not human nature at least not my human nature you know this i have a social butterfly and i die i die when i can't be around people so having this to be around people it makes me feel alive again makes me i have more passion gives me wanting to work harder so good job we are proud of you thank you for all you do she's amazing where can they find the blexit chapter just likes it in general online where can they find her oh if you go to blackstone.com chapters we have an interactive map that you can actually engage with and click on your chapter if you see that there isn't a clickable link that means that there's not a chapter in your state so then you can actually go

it at a church and we still stuck by our values even during hard times and the same speakers came out you know as far as support we had a prayer for king face and in the short amount of time that we

doing pretty good pretty good what's your name tell the camera tell the folks your name today oh my name is bill odin how y'all doing everybody out there bill hot how do you can i have you stand up for me so we can get you yeah come on let me get you up bill let me get you out i'm making you up but we need you we need you to school to young people what do you learn what do you feel is so important about these events why are they necessary for us to have these type of events it's necessary for we need to understand like uh robinson was talking because like i'm old because i've lived through all the stuff that the young folks say that we're fighting for we've had to fight for tomorrow we have it all we got to do is step up and take it and i'm one of those men who feel like men should be in the household we should have fathers in the household we should be doing all that type of thing so these events help educate the young folks and also help educate everybody else who comes to defense to see that we as conservatives are not out here riding we're not burning we're not looting we're having fun we're getting together doing what we're supposed to be doing it sounds like you're talking about personal accountability you know a lot about personal accountability and also you talk about the importance of having the father and just the family in general together in the home why did that break down what happened what happened to america in the black community in general well as we look back as it got easy when somebody's giving you something it's a lot easier that and then you start telling people say well you know if you don't have a man in the house we can get you more money if you have more babies but if you have a man house you can't make any money so more women start doing that stuff and that's one of our problems well thank you sir so much we appreciate you we needed some wisdom [Laughter] we needed someone thank you sir all right guys we're getting ready to wrap up halftime is always stay with us for the rest of the show we're out guys see you next time", "XbkFB1EtReM": "the thing that I think Republicans didn't understand they didn't get that the way the Left got into the black community was through culture this is Pierre take water it was about music it was about TV shows it was about all the things they were setting up around these neighborhoods that's are impacting culture so what blends is is doing is we're trying to fight back for the culture that's why the rallies are so upbeat when you come to a rally you're gonna have a great experience it's gonna be fun it's not gonna be some boring speech with someone in a three-piece suit you know preaching to you it's gonna be motivating you're gonna have a lot of energy in there really good music we want to be part of the culture however black to this for everyone the message about freedom freedom is not limited to one group that's why you see such a diverse crowd like that event there are things that we have to break through in life for everybody we all have our issues every race every gender freedom has no limits no color [Applause]", "hTok988W-bg": "when you're deciding who you're going to vote for you're really setting the direction of where you want our community to go and our children's futures people do not realize that a lot of these decisions are made you know you know at the ballot box I don't think that they know some of the things that they're voting in does not match the best for our community and one thing I know about our community we have been fighting for the best and fighting for our chance and and fighting for the quality of life that we want to have and we cannot let that slip through the fingers by not letting people know how important it is so I think that's the one disconnect that's in our community we don't understand how much of our direction and our altitude happens with the policies that we vote or do not vote for [Music]", "rMZv3Cr59x8": "[Music] we have to be realistic about where we are today right now we are in the wilderness in the 1960s they came around and they started offering welfare government help government trying to replace family when LBJ created the Great Society act experiment was black America we're gonna give them a little something but he'll keep them coming back government is trying to replace family once you break down the family you know what's gonna happen to the youth we're gonna run to the streets we are in a wilderness dr. King this church is as good a place as any to go back over your commitment to the civil rights movement we are in a new era a new phase of the struggle what [Music] [Applause] exactly what America should be we're not worried about color we're not worried about anything other than what makes this country great we gotta stop acting like we have to have some sort of excuse for why we can't do what we want to do in our life I stepped out of the mindset of being a victim people came after me and it took some courage but when I watched somebody like Martin Luther King Day very hard to draw courage from that we in Atlanta Georgia fine Luther King walk these streets so I can say what I want to say because I'm a free black man in America baby look if he former gang member the most beautiful thing about this country called America I got an opportunity to right my wrongs you can't tell me black people don't have opportunities in America [Music] we've got to get past this division over racism we've got to be one nation under God and there will be indivisible with liberty and justice for all [Music] you", "2fNoAEouLew": "[Applause] and now without further ado please give a warm welcome to former arizona police officer and radio host host brandon and a tomato [Music] go back to ATL what's going on blessed today gl hey I need everybody to stand to stand on your feet y'all get up when you when I'm in the crowd when I'm when I'm on stage you got to stand on your feet you got to get active I'm everybody in the back to ICU all right I won't try to repeat after me because I think that when we when we do this call and response it's just it just pulls this power out of everybody in the room right I want you to repeat after me I'm free God made me free oh yeah oh he's darling even enthusiastic I'm free God made me free I'm free God made me free all right y'all sit down now sit down I want to give a special thanks to all the law-enforcement people in the room anybody anybody law enforcement let's give another round of applause for the military in the room now we'll try to give yourselves a round of applause for being brave enough in such a liberal City to come out and represent the way y'all represented and I'm bear and I'm very proud it's not and I'm not saying that just for the heck of it it's because I know it's difficult you know when I first came out I said I'm a conservative I woke up I stepped out of the mindset of being a victim people came after me and it took some courage but when I watch somebody like Martin Luther King there ain't ain't very hard to draw courage from that when I see everybody in this room it's not very hard to pull courage from people coming together believing in something and I mean really believing it's believing it and and letting it be a part of your life so let me tell you a little bit about me how many people know who I am I guess I'm doing something right so I tell you you know kind of how I got to this point cuz those are you don't know me you probably wondered how's this dude up on stage you know just like him face ed with tattoos you know a former police officer how did I get to this point where I grew up both of my parents were separated I can't remember a time probably one time in my life that they actually got along my grandmother had my mother when she was 12 years old my daddy didn't really know his father my mama didn't know her father I met that man you know it later in life he lived across the street from my high school and didn't even say didn't have the courage to come and Satan unto us and so that's kind of the background that I came from that led me on the path to feel like it was cool to be like my bigger cousins who were just they just had a path to going to jail and doing things that wasn't right and at eight years old I got arrested for smoking marijuana in a vacant house and eight years old when I stopped smoking weed and for those of you who know anything about smoking weed we wasn't smoking little joints we were smoking blunts and eight years old and so that that put me on a path but let me tell you this the power of having my father made all the difference let me say that again examples y'all heard the power of having my father made the difference the power of a strong black man made the difference because I didn't just go down there and they check me in and rein me up and walk me out they called mr. Tatem and mr. Taylor main plan and I remember my dad coming into that facility and he said I'm gonna kill him I'm gonna kill him and I remember me and my brothers like y'all can leave us in here right here cuz this whoopin is about to be out of control but my dad did something that was special because he didn't whip us you know and I was ready for it I don't believe I was ready for it I thought I was ready for it I was preparing myself for it but while we were in the car we were driving home and I remember him saying this to me he said Brandon if you don't your ways if you don't act act with integrity you would never amount to nothing you will never be an NBA player because at the time I wanted to be just like Michael Jordan and that stuck to me harder than any whoopin ever could have and it put me on a path to want to be successful in athletics but I still had there's this bad attitude growing up around violence gave me this bad attitude and if you say something wrong to me you got to throw the hands some of y'all know what that mean you got now they say smoke back in the day we should say to peace with a hot pepper but some of y'all know what it is so I used to you know I used to have that attitude and it kind of led me into high school still feeling like I had to defend myself and be that way but one thing that changed is when I went to college I was an all-american football player in high school and I and I went to the University of Arizona it was primarily white and I'll tell you how this has changed my trajectory because I grew up in an all-black neighborhood I went to power lines Dunbar High School in Fort Worth Texas and for those of you know Paul Laurence Dunbar the family blacks black poet I went to that school and it was a bunch of drama there it had some good parts when it comes to athletics but when it comes to drama and people coming off the street in the school fighting you know people putting guns on each other in the parking lot and all I knew was the perspective from the black community and when I went to college I saw something different and I was like ding I don't think white people hate us as much as I thought they did I was expecting people to be calling me the N word and get off the campus you know but it didn't happen and then I realized that it's only two type of people in the world you got real people and you got fake people and they come in all different colors and and I think I'm speaking to a lot of y'all's experiences but the real change that happened in my life is when I found God I'll never forget that day 2008 I went down in Jesus name came up with the Holy Ghost and I was speaking of tongues some of y'all tongue feel people know what I'm talking about I don't when I start preaching up in here but God changed my life I pulled my doggone pants up and started acting like who God that presented me to be from the very beginning and what I always tell young people is that when does an Appletree become an Appletree not when the apples are falling off but when it was a seed in the ground it was already great as a seed in the ground and I won't young people to realize that a guy had to show that to me that I was great even back in Dunbar High School I was great even back when I was eight years old smoking weed and God had to bring that out of me and it really caused me to stop looking at race and understand that we're all God's children no matter what color you are I don't even matter and then that led me to football didn't work out for me you know I want to go to the league I was I was in the 2010 NFL Draft I didn't get drafted broke my heart I cried like a baby to rip my shirt out mad at God how dare you do this to me but then God had another plan for me and I had never thought about being a police officer a day in my life my only experience when I was 8 and they powered us in the car and they called us sardines at the time and we were out mad and we were wrong it's to left shoes but we were still mad at him but I needed an opportunity you know I had a college degree at the time I had a small son and I'm like look I got to put an X on the calendar because football is not yielding results I got a transition to something else I got a mouth to feed and so I applied for everything in the City of Tucson the police department called me back and I mean at first I'll tell you how to phone Carwin so at the time me and my son's mom we had got into a little argument over the phone and then the next morning I get a phone call and they say it's the Tucson Police Department and I'm like and I'm like yeah how can I help you and they say well you apply for the job and I'm like ok yeah we could talk now but I knew nothing about policing so I said you know what I got to do a ride-along I need to go see what this is like see if I even like it went and did a ride-along with an officer named Sean Payne the greatest men and I've met other than my daddy son pain I pulled up on him in the parking lot I say look man I just want to do a ride-along he said come next week we can roll the first time in my life I saw a hero the first time in my life I should think these NFL players and nothing against football players you know you work hard to get to the point that you're add but I never seen a man that went from changing a flat tire of an elderly woman to save in a young man's life who was attempting to commit suicide I mean we literally went there we got the call and we was going 70 miles per hour down the residence the street ain't never gone that fast in a car that anybody found out about but we were rolling we almost died twice because people don't know how to move to the right and we get to the scene and he's running through the apartment complex and they let me kind of run behind him they kicked the door in and once they got in they let me peek around the corner and the kid was literally cutting his wrists in the back room he's like it right it was kids laying on the ground they had to jump over these kids he was on the table cutting his wrists and the craziest part about this is that when we got back into the car my heart was still beating I'm like what just happened to us and he you know he going back to ask me well you know how was your family and I'm like with family I got family you know so you know I just seen how he was and he said look I do this every day I do this all day and I'm like man I have to do what this man is doing I think it's a calling on my life so I became a police officer I did everything I was on a SWAT team I was a field trainer I taught at the academy I did all kind I was a Pio a spokesperson for the police department surprisingly enough and it just made me change my mentality about how policing in America actually happens not what's on the media not what people say not with two or three people I felt at a traffic stop but what's really going on and what I can say is that for them I mean it opened my understanding that these officers are out here risking their lives every doggone day all day when you go to sleep and you dreaming I don't know about 20/20 or something I don't know you dreaming they're out there risking their lives they're out there driving code three lights and sirens they are her sin the most horrible things that any human person can see have to go home to their family and do it again the next day it does and I'll tell you this there's a minimal amount of room for racism on a police department I'll be the first one to tell you that there are some idiots on the police department that's it is that that do your teeth their dentist yes it is that's your pastor not y'all pass because y'all pass is a good talk about the other people down the street but there's idiots everywhere but most people are literally trying to do what's right and let me give you some numbers because a young lady on Houston campus told me the other day she go my biggest fear is being killed by police officers and I'm like damn we lost man your biggest fear is not heart disease and I'm not a lot of stuff and I said young lady do you realize that it's a higher probability probability of you being struck by lightning than being killed unarmed by police officers and if some of you guys don't may not know this number because I looked it up seven people in the United States of America seven black people in the United States of America have been shot unarmed and anybody that know anything about law enforcement just because you're unarmed don't mean you're not a daily threat but just for the sake of argument all of them are bad shootings right I gave it it I said seven of them there's forty million black people in America that number is point zero zero zero zero zero zero one seventy five percent of black communities getting killed unarmed that's like one in every six million people six million is 12 times the size of Atlanta and you're telling me that's your biggest fear that is unjustifiable what is the media telling us what are our parents teaching us we should not be f fear of police officers how about you go down there and fill out an application and become a police officer if you fear the police officers so much become one patrol your own community therefore you can dictate how people are treating yo people because that's what I did I signed up and I I treated everyone with respect you know I pray for them I respected them I gave them hope when they had no hope and sometimes I gave them hoping I didn't have no hope and that's what and that's what police officers do not all of them but that's what most of them do and I want us to get out of the mentality of believing what everybody's telling us that somehow we're these victims somehow the white man is just looming over us and waiting for us to mess up so you throw us out of a job listen if a man turn you down on a job today you better go down the whole street that job that job that job that job until you get a job nobody owe you nothing you work hard for everything you kid and if somebody ever hand you something any worth having I think we should understand and internalize that because we ain't victims ladies and gentlemen we ain't nobody's victims nobody in the history of the black community from the time we came in on ships so today was a victim they put us in a situation and what do we do we escaped through the Bible I think I think that's almost naked I almost preached on his own the God of the Bible gave us a pathway to be free we used it then we should be using it now if I don't say nothing else I want us to understand that no your position know that each and every person in here you have something that God is putting in you that you are supposed to be exercising right you're supposed to be displaying to the world and we will all become better when you find out what that is don't be looking down the street at somebody and wonder what they doing why you look in the mirror first what am i doing what can I do to succeed what how am i treating people when someone a cop pulled me over what am i saying to him first and this is a personal thing my dad always told me he said you know the teacher will say I did some at the school and he's like like nah I said now daddy she was she the lady she'd be meaning me and I'll he go I don't take care of their lady what did you do because you're going to get that whoopin not your teacher so I just wanted to understand it to two major situations that I want to touch on that I think it's being displayed in the media and I don't want you guys to fall victim to this mentality you're jumping on the bandwagon so there's been the situation in the Central Park five how many people know about the Central Park five and so here's what I say and I don't know if people don't like what I said or not I can't help them what I will say is that do your research don't just listen to somebody because they SJW an hour down the street makes where they little black people they are just doing this for money and they got you out here looking like a fool if you look at the situation between the Central Park five and you read what the president supposedly wrote out in the paper he didn't even mention the Central Park Park 5 in the paper he didn't even mention him not one time some of y'all probably know that who read the who read what he pulled out in the paper didn't mention it one time he didn't mention them kids by name some people try to tell you that they were interviewing they didn't have an adult everybody had an adult present don't watch that movie don't watch said that that documentary was a lot we sit there I looked at the facts and then I watched dr. Marian it made my blood ball they tried to make it seem like these little kids weren't doing nothing they were in the park they brutalized other people which they were charged with and then they all admitted they all admitted to doing some form of harm today young lady to that guy that got killed and if we look at it and we say let's stop getting emotional and look at facts so we can actually defend people that need to be defended I'm gonna give you another scenario what's the Rodney Reed I mean know who Rodney Reed is everybody's out right they read his innocent Rodney Reed he's innocent he may be but did they tell you that he raped three other women did they tell you that he raped the twelve-year-old now didn't tell you that yeah DNA sample came back after he turned himself in for a drug charge came back he raped three other women wanting kidnap money raping her near a train track and then he to the house of a 12 year old who was by herself in return I don't know how many different directions he bit her blindfolded her or they don't tell you that did they they'd learn to us and I'm cool we're doing an investigation saying hey if that brother didn't kill the young lady they're accusing him of then she shouldn't be put to death but the forensic evidence showed that his DNA was on her or in her and the reason why is because they were in a relationship they try to tell you he and even though the girl so I want us to be mindful of these things it's another situation that came out and then I'm gonna finish it's a young lady Felicity Huffman got into that school conflict or whatever right and then it was a black lady and I forget her name now it was a black lady who they said got sentenced to five years in prison because she sent her kid to another school how many of y'all read that situation how many y'all believe that she got five years for send their kids who are alternate school okay y'all smart what am i doing you go sit down but listen it was a lie she had got caught for prostitution and she had played to five years oh because of another offense I'm just stayin fast I'm just stating facts but that's what I'm saying y'all I want us to also understand not only are we not victims but we need to be informed let's not jump on a bandwagon on every situation when the officer does something wrong let's do our research unless because I don't like it when people say all black people are this way I don't like that and we shouldn't say all cops are this way either we should be mindful to take each individual situation do our research do our due diligence and say they do is a piece of crap he should go to jail this dude did not do anything he should be left free and I know because I'm in the crowd of people who are dedicated who love this country can I get a love this country that I know I'm speaking to the choir but I want to thank you guys for coming out I appreciate you listen to what I have to say hopefully there's something I said we're sticking to the horse everybody but I want you to stand up one more time before I get off the stage repeat after me I'm free God made me free I'm free God made me free I'm free God made me free amen thank you guys [Applause]", "miIODuEPXHU": "[Music] it's a good [Music] we're just taking our way to sleep in our lives we got no it [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] every child of this we United [Music] what's up world how y'all doing I'm not doing this your boy Derek rat amigo I am here with you in the first things first y'all I feel so blessed to come to the room tonight to talk with you to break bread with you to speak with you to try to give you a piece of my dad used to tell me I'm gonna go over a lot of stuff in a short amount of time and if you could take one nugget of that to leave with him we've accomplished something first things first I want to address the elephant in the room before we go any further and that is about Saturday I was thinking about a nice jog and I was thinking about what I much talk to y'all about and I got word that Candace was taken off the Twitter for something she said and so I went and looked at it looked at it about 50 times and from what I saw she was talking about was people in Michigan getting back to work and I'm gonna tell you all this from the bottom of my heart right now what she said was basically no different than when Patrick Henry said give me liberty or give me death or when any of our great American heroes made a quote a good almost similar to you know there's nothing to fear but fear itself so I know we're all looking forward to Candis filling up Thursday I want to let him know we ride with a you know I'm saying we watching and we making sure that we allow them to know that we watch it because we have to speak up y'all when things happen to us we have to speak up and stand up for each other so let's get into it who is Derek grant and ego you might be wondering a lot of y'all may not know if you ask people they'll say I'm somewhat of a Renaissance man I've always believed in kind of a Michelangelo philosophy of not being one thing but kind of progressing through life and changing through different stages so you know I've very cultured like a lot of mini tragic you know from interning with the Secret Service to getting a couple degrees in behavioral science to counseling underprivileged kids taking care of a senior citizen home oil and gas exact all the good stuff but I think all four days about how I made it through this journey but for this particular talk I will provide just a few marks that will be in relation to what I want to talk to you about tonight and what I want to talk to you about tonight is something called mind liberation and it's something I feel that a lot of us are lacking but leader on the right track to get started I was born in Oakland California you know I was in California and I lived about ten blocks away from the governor's mansion where Ronald Reagan used to live I lived a very privileged life coming up when I was young my parents came from nothing but you know the type of parents that are always going to work hard so their kids do better and they succeeded and we did do better and I lived a very cultured life no complaints I never wanted for anything until the age of 12 and then there was a change in trajectory by a tragic event we all out there filled me how your life can change for one event one event comes in and just kind of puts you off in what happened I had a sibling who was murdered in cold blood back on black crime just is what it is it has no name sometimes and I tell this to a lot of people because I want people to understand because I have two degrees in behavioral science well I know a lot of people tuned in and said hey look I see a picture this dude with the president he's doing this he's doing that he doesn't understand he doesn't understand I want people to understand we can't judge images all the time because there's people out here who've been through the same things you I mean I'd be able to give you advice or how to cope with things that you know do it another time you know what I mean so that's why I mentioned so back to the story to make a long story short after a couple years after that we had nothing nothing yeah nothing no more it was all gone moved around went to the South basically came up and understood that you know I went from living a high life way over here to experience in all types of things here and it kind of created the beginning of my base the start of what would be my book report on America yeah because I'm sitting here and I'm saying to myself okay whether I lived in this regime or this regime one thing stays true and that is as a black person in America I've been trained to be a low social currency instead of actual currency so when I looked around in the wealthy neighborhoods I saw black folks we're in love with shine likes cars beautiful things houses bottleservice things could be done tomorrow while other people were more concerned with health wealth physical fitness land ownership property and I started saying to myself how is this possible how is it possible I have family members steadily going to jail how is it possible that I'm a victim of this type of violence at this very early age and nobody has any answers and nobody's saying anything get better so initially like everyone else initially I initially blamed the right I blame the Conservatives because that's what everybody else is doing they basically the stars the singers the athletes as they fall they don't want us to guide us in this condition and I believed it for the most part until I started noticing a few common sense items that didn't really add up y'all okay someone saying the audio is fading is it fading still is the audio fading okay is it not can you hear me now can you hear me is it better okay someone's saying the audios better I'm sorry I had I had I had to Queen I had to quit there I said the audio was fading on me so I didn't know like is it okay now testing testing on you talk more louder are we good are we good are we good just give me a sign that we're good okay are we better now okay let's see here let's see let's see testing one two testing one two testing testing testing one two okay someone's saying it's a little better we try to fix this real quick testing testing I'll be back on testing can you hear me my better now am I better somebody give me a sign to say I'm better abroad so we can get back okay somebody saying I'm better okay so you can hear me good last chance you can hear me good okay so basically where I left off I noticed this I noticed there were some strange things going on I was I was blaming the entire right I was blaming the Conservatives because that's what my Hollywood people were telling me that's cool but other people were telling me everybody the black community we've been vote in a certain way the whole time until I started doing my own research I started understanding some certain things that I was noticing that like 99% of all the elected officials all black elected officials were on the left yeah we would get no relief we get no help you know we would get no help so basically I also notice that the left was actually the people that started slavery I noticed that people on the right we're the ones that try to banish the Ku Klux Klan I noticed I started to notice that the first black Republican senator was in 1870 what a first black Democrat senator was somewhere around 1993 and I kept thinking to myself if we are struggling for justice peace in progress why do we keep voting the same folks in office with no results this is what I'm trying to wonder I began to get heavy in the Malcolm and Martin at this time y'all heavy in the Malcolm and Martin and I was noticing that Malcolm over here was being super militant he was cool they allowed him to be super militant over here but the moment he went to Mecca and came back and was basically like look I've seen white brothers Hispanic brothers every type of brothers then all of a sudden it was all good and he was like I'm all good and all of a sudden he had to go then I got into Martin and how he was a really passive how Martin was passive and at the end he changed and he said you know I may be leading my people into a burning house so I need to take my clout and I'm gonna stalk her poor people's movement and I'm gonna go to DC and I'm not leaving until the agenda is met so he took his passive miss but uses cloud and came to the middle because he needed something tangible and then he had to go and I came to a realization y'all that black America was lacking tangible currency they were lacking anything tangible all they were getting was false promises and I began to sit and tell myself and think to myself we may be getting played here somebody is pulling okie-doke on us this is facts this is true right around this time is crazy but right around this time because just like everyone else I'm wondering am I the only person that feels this way am I the only person that understands things this way this dual popped up out of nowhere this rapper and his name was Tupac Shakur right so I'll never forget it I'll never forget it was the first black individual who actually had an urban following that said something that didn't automatically give his vote to the left and I'll never forget the interview he said look I represent 5 million album sales and I promise you the next time there's an election imma have each candidate sitting on the other side saying he can do for my people and it shocks me to the core because it was everything I had been thinking about everything now the crazy part about it was that let's see some people are saying moving my closer let's get closer can you hear me better now can you hear me better now can you hear me better now you'll have to forgive me the operations is telling me one way in another like you know I'm saying somebody's so somebody saying a little bit here I apologize try to speak louder but when I speak louder they say it's echoing so I don't know so can you hear me better now so again like he said it's fading in and out let me change the mic setting you're gonna be backstage talking here so can you hear me can you hear me now because this is not on my end this is not on my end can you hear me now okay sorry about that y'all I'm getting cut off like the devil is hard at work and I'm not supposed to use the devil right I tell people don't use the devil but this is a situation where I'm getting fade back and forth different things if I'm too loud if I'm too soft but it's the same okay so we just go forward I left off with Tupac right so Tupac says basically you know imma have both parties on the other side of the table saying what they could do for my people unfortunately in September of 96 Tupac Lions update about eight weeks before the election that's neither here nor there the damage was done damage in a good way because at that point I said to myself yo I'm not the only one who feels this way I'm not the only one who's not willing to sit here just broke my boat away to a regime just because you know they mean there has to be something tangible as well as at the same time of this untimely death the sitting current Democrat first lady who wound up losing the last election I think y'all know who I'm talking about but the sitting Democrat first lady wanna lose the last election that same year had referred to black youth as super predators she referred to black youth of super predators and at that same time the sitting vice president who is currently the choice for the left right now he wrote a crime bill that is responsible for locking up more blacks and Latinos than any other time on planet earth that was before I found out about this same candidate that is currently to pick for the left having letters of Correspondence back and forth with segregationists in the 70s in opposing desegregation of buses so I'm sitting here at the same time and it hit me like a ton of bricks y'all it hit me like a ton of bricks the black community had been hoodwinked lied to the black community sleeping with the enemy and I'm not talking about a Julia Roberts movie all talking about real life so I said to myself at that point I said look we have hurdles we have things that are going on how did we get to this point and I want to take a minute to discuss with you let me know if y'all could still hear me because like I said we've been having issues are you okay can you hear me because I'm about to get into the dishes and I'd like for people to hear this I really would like for people to hear this I want a lot of times we spend a lot of times pointing the finger at people and we don't get to how we got there or how to fix it we do a lot of diagnosing but we don't talk about how to cure so take a few minutes to talk about diagnosing and what we can see are they playing the game and how we could spin the game back okay so what I like to talk about in these black-american hurdles since we don't have a lot of time is for things so let's talk about four things very quickly with you one I feel black America has been programmed to worship celebrity handlers we like to call them ops but they've been programmed to worship these people second black America has been programmed to feel like they're not American third black America has been programmed to feel like you personally are not worthy of a legacy and fourth black America has been programmed to practice plantation hate and like I said I believe that type of thing is completely different the regular hey and we'll talk about it in a second but first things first the celebrity analyst the celebrity analyst my dad always told me never let a rich man tell you how to stay broke never let a rich man tell you how to stay broke a lot of these athletes and entertainers out there with a whole lot of ideas but they need helping nobody win in life they they're sitting here hating on the president hating on people not giving nothing now I'll go back in time to win last year the president invited a lot of these people to the White House and said look there's a lot of talk about prison reform and police.com here let's talk none of them showed up none of them showed up y'all and I had to tell myself at that point what exactly is going on a lot of them said hey we're not going because we're keeping it real now again I ask you the common person this celebrity athlete is in this bubble bath in the spot a hot tub on the hill but we got kids in poverty people in prison all this other stuff and he said he's not going to talk to the president because he keeping it real now my response would be real and tell him the needs you have but they don't want to do that because they quote-unquote keeping it real these people are like the Judas to Jesus they're only here to cause confusion and everyone knows it now I want to take a split second while we on this top of the handlers I want you to know it's not just celebrities it could also be church people it could be media types it could be an analyst things of that nature I want to go back to my brother Jerome Adams the Surgeon General a few weeks ago a few weeks ago Jerome Adams tried to come through and he made a statement based on the co vid where he said I want you to protect Big Mama I want you to protect that whele I want you to protect this person and that person and they I guess it was the next day or the day after a black correspondent or a black reporter or whatever said how do you feel about offending people because you used the term Big Mama I want to go out of my way to say this right now my great grandmother I didn't know her real name till she passed away I refer to her as Big Mama from the day I was born so the day I passed away how dare these people try to take our traditions and say that we need to watch this and watch that I support the wrong I support everybody who keeps it real and everybody needs to keep it real let me tell you why these people are control opposition she told that to Jurong because we are in a situation where if Jerome comes through when he says Big Momma all the sudden is too good for her right but I guarantee you if Jerome said I want you to protect your grandmother and protect your grandfather and protect this she when it came back the next day I say oh how does it feel to be whitewashed how does it feel cool or whatever in other words she's controlled opposition she's only there to cause confusion now you as the viewer I want you to picture this just like it's always said these gotcha moments these people are constantly pulling gotcha moments so it's like oh can I laugh at this or do I need to see the deeper game so when I hear her say this I as a person need to be thinking okay that's funny whatever blah blah but she ain't getting me nothing she ain't give me no land no property her whole squad is whack but Jerome his whole team is talk about prison reform it's all about pumping money to the ghettos and the body else they're talking about HBCU money from the kids yeah yeah this is a distraction that is my liberation what we need to start thinking about okay second people are talking about we are programmed to feel like we're not American I'm gonna tell y'all something straight up I was born I mean I'm sorry I'm number one my family has been here since 1760 or my family's been here since 1760 the definition of Native American native means you were there before the inception my family was here before 1776 my family was here before America became America so how dare you try to tell me that I need to go back to Africa or somewhere else - I don't even know nothing about and I've never been to this is the game they are trying to run I want you to imagine building a 2,000 room mansion with the pool inside the lake the money the refrigerators the the the tile everything 17 car garage and the whole nine you got it all and then somebody walk up to your crib and say hey look I know you built this I know you did it but this is you ain't really about this place descent you where you need to go is across the ocean to this place you never been your grandparents your great-grandparents never been you need to go over there it's that's your real home that's what you really need to be do you know how stupid that's the house furthermore do you know how crazy it is for you to even listen to that but we are my liberation we gotta wake up third the legacy we program to feel like we don't deserve one I talk a lot about something called reflective glory oh that's weird you have been programmed not to find your true glory or to try find your works from nature but to sit here and say I'm living my life through LeBron James good good Lady Gaga got a concert if she win it that means I'm winning no it don't it means you have refused to look at the man in the mirror like Michael Jackson said and you refuse to find what you need to find about yourself to make you feel like you're worthy and I don't blame you because at the end of the day they popping this on you but at a certain point you have to go solo look in the mirror and say hey look I deserve my own money I deserve my own shine I deserve a legacy for my kids so we have to address that and we have to fight that because they popping it on us finally we have to turn from plantation hating okay a plantation hey like I said it's different than regular hate but what I mean by that is it appears in the black community they want hate to run ramp it way more than anywhere else for instance during the last election we saw a president and other people go off on each other they talk in norway's they're doing this they're doing that but at the end of the election they also drinking beer hanging out like they're supposed to hug in whatever to stare the other as far as the black community though it appears that I can I can agree with somebody on 99 things but if I agree with if I disagree on one thing if I disagree on one thing all the sudden I'm akiles he's Hector we're in the Battle of Troy and somebody gotta die that's the way we've been programmed there is no we just addressed this address that you disagree on one thing all the sun's banished and it's facts I have a certain person that I like that is a doctor philosophy and I quote him alive but is I could agree with him on like 98 99 things but one of the things he doesn't like his multiculturalism he doesn't agree sometimes with race-mixing he's a black man race-mixing so if i post some of his stuff a lot of people come on and be like and you can oh so do you hear what he said about this but I'm taking the other 99 Nuggets he could work on that I could perform on the other part we gotta learn that it's not no bucks system that's all or nothing and we gotta judge black people as a monolith because right now we could talk about all the bad things that George Washington did or we could look at the good stuff like I do I love George Washington even though he was a flawed character I love Tom's Chester he's a flawed character I love JFK a flawed character but right now they trying to bring up stuff about dr. King and even we see they're like oh now y'all trying to soil dr. King like so the end of the day we have to stand up at a certain point and worry about us and the Nuggets we take now with all those combined I told you before worrying about social currency overactive actual currency ain't gonna work we have to worry about tangible currency in my hand tangible in my hand tangey that's what I want to see I want to hear nothing about no future no roses we've been promised waiting seek some tangible and when you worried about tangible mess when it comes to you and your glory and your your so let's go back to everything and talk about it how we address it so we go to the first thing celebrity worship handlers they come in - hey bro you don't need to listen to those people up in DC this trying to get the free whatever because the soup the basketball player said not to and the singer told you not to and the blah blah blah told you not to notice I do this is how you respond nah bro because the basketball claim gave me no no not the people in DC the right over here they didn't and did they do so that's tangible by the way get up on my face because they provide nothing but confusion that's how you attack it now they come through with the second part well you know you ain't supposed to be from America anyway we need to go back to Africa need to get some boats and go back to Africa your immediate response the same is mine 100% no bro I don't know nothing about no Africa I don't know nothing about Africa I'm here I'm from America I born here raised here and all the whole not 100% that's how we get past that thing program to feel like you deserve a legacy same thing they get with the reflective glory we have your pastors your other people that could speak for you know my pastor don't need to speak for me I have my own relationship with Jesus and if he continues to try to speak me without putting something finally turn from the program plantation hey when they tell you the same things hey man that Candice girl she's not as whatever that dare do that Brandon he's an ex-cop you don't listen to him the point is the same yes but I see them kicking down doors in DC I see them doing stuff I see with my own eyes how I was tangibly gonna affect me so I don't need to listen to you I mean that's what it's all about so I'm gonna begin to wrap this thing up like I said I am sorry for the technical difficulties that happened I do want to say one thing before I go because a lot of people ask the same question so I want to answer it even though it's not here and it's basically people have asked me how did you know that you wanted to align or push into the Black Sea movement how did you know you wanted to go in and kind of similarly join Candice or do things with Candice and I'll be 100% honest it goes back to what I was saying earlier when I saw a bunch of stars and athletes running around they were talking about what we doing for the hood we doing this we doing that we doing this but I think the reality was they were in their house they weren't doing nothing they weren't showing up they were talking about we run in camps and we given to charity well everybody knows charity don't get to the ghetto cherry you don't get to the ghetto policy gets together policies changing and when I saw Candace and her people I saw Candace doing kick doors in DC like so where's these other people in a hot tub talking about y'all go March listen up your new shoes what a chilly Candace is basically going to congressman's office in DC and pulling kick doors like this is what we want and it was the closest thing that I had seen to Martin's design for the Poor People's Movement where it was basically like yo we'd go on a DC we use in the cloud we got and we ain't leaving until the agenda is mad and so when I saw that I was basically like yo this is this is tangible but working on style no to me anyways like I said if anybody has any questions I don't even know if they're gonna are they gonna send me questions right now I'm hoping they can hear me I'm so sorry about the the mics but I'm not sure what happened but I hope some of y'all got some message anyway out of that it happened so I apparently didn't send me some questions let's see what they got if y'all have any questions what's the best piece of advice you've ever received um I think the best piece of advice that I've ever received in my life is that I need to read about me solely me um when it comes to judging anything I need to look at the man in the mirror and make that change often especially in the Conservative Party and in conservative circles we have people who will say yes but they're not this type of person or that type of person or they cuss too much or they talk too much or they party too much of a - whatever everybody has their own walk and I can promise you if you spend in time worrying about somebody's walk and how they're not exactly the way you perceive them you gonna catch a massive L it's not any no I'm not telling you this like I'm filming you I'm telling you from stuff I know I'm telling you this is my book report on stuff that I've had to look in the mirror and tell myself to you know because at the end of the day is like look it wasn't until I started just worrying and saying look I need to focus on me I need to quit focus on is this person following this and part of this and this and this we are love I just have love for you I may not agree with some of the things you doing but I didn't go ostracize you and kick you out I'm just gonna say I love you I hope you change up and I love you still kickin it though you know he's still good that's the best thing because now I'm solely focused on moving forward and God could take me to where he need to take me rather than these things I'm moving forward but I'm trying to make sure this person and this person and this person and I'm in too many buckets instead of worrying about my path okay what's next how do you get people to stop looking to the government for everything um I just told you everything I went through everything I just went doing the thing about hurdles were situations where people trying to tell you that I can give you little instead of giving you the whole there's a picture out there with a teddy bear it's like a little teddy bear this girl's holding this little teddy bear and Jesus is in the picture and he's got a giant teddy bear behind his back and he's saying just give me the teddy bear and she doesn't know she's used to this she's saying this is all I've got this is all whatever blah blah blah we have a situation where we have in an elitist group that is telling black people telling people in the body are telling you you don't have nothing everybody hates you like the entire why can you be hate sheet-like and Bobo so I can't I want people to change but we have to show them we have to show them and have open arms when we do so you know what we got next I think we got one more do you feel like Americans will ever be able to see past and racial to divide to a unified country this is the way I see this plan now um I think there will be simply because you have no choice you know as well as I do grace right now it's being used as a tool it's being used as a tool to divide but more and more people are mixing so as more and more people mix we kind of lose this ability to kind of have some sort of your dark hair light your way or whatever most people I know to be totally honest they don't even go around saying oh I'm white I'm white I'm white I'm white I mean it's basically like people are already kind of losing that whole just position and believe it or not God works in mysterious ways so for those of you out there who are sitting here saying oh I'm kind of mad I'm kind of upset this is going on you have to understand that a lot of good has happened from this tool we started seeing more white people from ever we never stiffen up for black babies who seeing white people with thousands and thousands and thousands of followers that I've never seen before saying you need to quit aborting all these black babies this is a genocide there's more black babies aborted in New York City than born and I'm saying white people are dressed that I've never seen that before so we have to know while we're looking at the cup is half empty we all also need to be looking at it as half full you know I mean we look at both you know so I hope that answer your question so let's see I think that might be it it was great coming in like I said next time like I said I'm sorry about the technical difficulties I don't know how that happen so like I said every time there tries there's supposed to be something good you got to deal with it the point is that you push through and continue to the end which is what we do and that's the beautiful part about America we operate the same way there's a few hiccups but we pushed it in this is it for the day I want to tell y'all tomorrow it's gonna be amazing I believe King face is speaking I believe handle some blacks at Texas people appearing so you definitely definitely want to tune in tomorrow and remember Candace's up Thursday shout out to her shout to everybody in the family let's continue to push and remember like my boy Tommy Davidson of Martin used to say there's only two things important in this world and both of them are love I have a good night god bless peace", "lPOd4rDAd2M": "[Music] I had a conversation with a friend and I remember years back somehow he got on the topic of taxes I was just talking about how the government always charges us you know always texts everything we do my friend say it uh always shut up you sound like a Republican [Music] this is math you take one you know my mom taught me how to how to work for everything she really believes in the Second Amendment don't say but wait a minute that's that's a conservative value so everything that my mom raised me to be and me being raised to vote liberal I said wait a second something something is not right I begin to have to study for myself I began to google on things I began to you know to read up I'm hearing certain policies that they're talking about on conservative radio that were actually that were actually help America as a whole even even in black people let's sit up lifted me and I was able to be more bold really start speaking boldly to my family and like hey and awaken and it's happening [Music]", "5Z3SXQjDmsc": "our next speaker is a wonderful man a man of God great father an author of an amazing book help me introduce David Harris jr. history today nothing like this has ever taken place inside this country before the unity that you all came to this place with in your heart it's something that's unprecedented and can I say that the United States of America will never be the same because of you I'm so thankful for Candace Owens the visionary that she is somebody that said you know what people need to stop talking about the problems and actually do something about it do you guys know there's protestors outside you saw them I was standing right there in the middle of those protestors and you know what the one thing I didn't hear any of them say they weren't talking about any solutions why do protestors never talk about solutions and why do they not want to answer any questions because they don't know the answers so how are we going to get anywhere as a people as a country if we're not willing to listen to one another you guys are willing to listen to one another you guys are some of the most multicultural multifaceted from different backgrounds that I've ever seen in my life and that spans all across the country I speak all across the country I meet so many amazing people and one thing that stands out to me is there left for God I'm so thankful for Shannon and her message there's a thread that unites every single one of us it's an understanding and an appreciation for God a belief in him and his love for us and the fact that we weren't born in this time and in this era by accident if you don't believe in God then maybe you just think it's an accident that you're here maybe it's just well this is just a talent man no you were born for this time for this era for this very hour to be in the United States of America you realize you could have been born anywhere in the world you had the privilege of being born in the greatest country to ever exist at the greatest time you know my first video the what crazy was right after the third debate between Trump and Hillary when I had a couple thousand friends on Facebook I didn't have a Facebook page I didn't know Candace Owens I didn't know Brandon Tatum I didn't know Rob Smith I didn't know Larry Henry King face one down here I didn't know and you know what I wasn't really paying attention to much I had came out in opposition against Barack Hussein Obama I had came out very publicly about that you know the number one reason his stance on abortion [Music] his stance on partial-birth abortion he even voted against the bill that would have given life resuscitation to babies that had survived attempted murder and this man became the President of the United States and what did he do for the black community what'd he do for his own city of Chicago what did he do for Christians and yet America elected him twice and yet there are still people that want to say America's racist are you kidding me how in the world can a country elect a black man as president and yet you still want to say oh the country's racist it doesn't make any sense you got to choose what you're going to believe unfortunately so many people and this is the current state of the Democrat Party and the mainstream media who are working in tandem you got to understand the mainstream media is the propaganda arm of the Democrat Party the exact same way that KKK was the mill the militia arm of the Democrat Party it's the same thing I can always tell what somebody's paying attention to who they're investing their mind in and what they're watching and where they're getting their information from from what kind of stats they want to spout back to me so many people are only listening to one side I listened to CNN I listened to MSNBC because I want to know what the heck they're talking about that so crazy it's always people I'll stir it up talk about all this nonsense it is a non-stop 90 plus percent of the time they are spouting nothing but hatred division doing nothing but trying to stir up emotional responses and Americans especially the black community that don't have their own sound understanding they are manipulating us in order to control us in order to dominate us you know what the KKK is agenda was manipulate dominate and control by any means necessary what does the mainstream media doing manipulate dominate and control the people that's why we call the Democrat plantation it's a plantation of the mind it's one of the hardest things to change a person's mind when they have their mind made up that's control that's why the mainstream media tries so hard and you got to give them credit they're obviously doing a good job because there's a whole lot of people that know a lot of non facts but feel really emotional about about it they think they know oh you can't tell me nothing I was outside and these protesters are spouting off all this nonsense anti blacks at this expletive Candice Owens if this F I'm like you know what I'm just trying to ask you a question do you know that Candice actually said you know what let them come inside let them come inside so I went out there with the intention of saying hey you guys want to come inside and actually listen to what these people have to say how do you think that went they don't even want to hear it they are so emotionally stirred up with no facts that it cuts them off for even being open to hearing the other side you know what that is it's immaturity and yeah I heard somebody say it it's slavery but it's it's a mental slavery but it's an immaturity because grown folks adults even young teenagers can learn to sit and have a dialogue with somebody that they don't agree with so they can try to find out what the other person means Abraham Lincoln the Republican that freed the slaves said when I began to reason with a man I spend two thirds of my time thinking about what he's trying to say to me I'll tell you this is an issue in communication period and being married for 25 years to my high school sweetheart I could tell you most arguments and disagreements would not take place if the person that was listening was actually listening so many of us I'm guilty too I've done this plenty I had to work real hard to make sure I didn't do this so many of us when we're in a dialogue we're so excited to have something to say in return and we're thinking about what we're gonna say in return that we're not even listening to the person that's a problem but I'll tell you well I think it's a problem period it's definitely a bigger problem for those that think they're right while they're sitting on that plantation mindset they are not willing to listen to anybody else so I gotta give it up to you guys how many of you guys in here have shared somebody that's on this stages videos or somebody that's a conservative voice how many of you guys have shared something see you guys are the army you guys are the real army give yourselves up applause really give yourselves up applause thank you so much you guys are the real army because none of us what would be up here we wouldn't have the voices that we do we wouldn't have the ability to reach other people if you weren't sharing and in the audience and people watching this as well voices like yours are also gonna start to pop up because you know why we can't do this ourselves it's not about us it's about the message and you know what the message is we are in the most pivotal time in our country's history I truly believe that I thought 2016 was the most pivotal and I believe that it was at that time but we're not there now now we have political candidates that want to become the next president of our United States that are openly calling for socialism are you kidding me and they're and they don't get booze I wish they'd got booze I really do they don't get booze they get applauded that tells me that tells me there's a whole lot of people that are misled in our country and how are they gonna hear a message that even plants a seed to change their mind how that's right from you from you from your own voice and from you sharing other voices of truth of knowledge and of impact we've got to do this together we've got to come together as a nation as a country and for my black brothers and sisters out there we've got to come together as a people I want something so amazing on my way to Baltimore today Candace Owens I mean here here's here's what's really taking place in our country our sister queen visionary beat herself Candace Owens was invited by Sean P Diddy Combs to speak at a revolt conference that was all black folks Oh black folks in Atlanta you know who else was there tea I was there tip was there you know Welles was there Katrina Pierson was there killer Mike was there but for Sean P Diddy Combs to invite Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson to an all-black gathering in Atlanta folks something is shifting [Applause] and it's because of you and your ability and your desire to share the truth that we share because you share and videos go viral the message goes viral when the message goes crazy people see it for p-diddy to have Candace and Katrina on the stage and it was an hour-and-a-half and Candace held her own and she was in a room full of wolves they were not giving her any love thank God for killer Mike on the stage with her on the panel that actually said hold on a minute y'all need to shut up and let her actually talk and finish what she's trying to say he would say one thing and because he's accepted in the black community it would be received completely different than when Candace said the exact same thing that is truly disgusting a despicable thing for especially our own black community to hate our own black community so much just because of their political affiliations I posted a video yesterday on my Instagram if you're not following me David J Harris jr. Instagram Twitter YouTube Facebook I posted a video of very graphic very very disturbing video I was really upset it was about 8 to 10 black guys in Minneapolis that were teeing off on one white guy anybody here see that video disgusting absolutely disgusting to see a gang of people and the guy initially in the beginning was just sitting there next to him it looked like one of them tried to take his phone and when he tried to say that's not gonna happen they all ganged up on him I believe that the reason that that kind of hatred and violence is brewing in the black community is because of what Barack Obama started when he was in office and the mainstream media continuously push that he's a racist Donald Trump is not a racist he's disavowed white supremacy he's dissing filed white nationalism he's disavowed that David Duke in the KKK I don't know how many times at least over 20 times and can you believe that tea I had the audacity and the ignorance gee I hope you're watching because it was really ignorant for him to say that Donald Trump has never disavowed white nationalism or the KKK t.i a very well-respected brother in the hip-hop community out of pure ignorance said to an entire room of black folks and obviously the hundreds of thousands that were going to watch it later something that is absolutely not true something that if he took his time and actually did his own research and use the little thing called YouTube ti you'd find out that Donald Trump has disavowed them over and over and over and over again what that proves is that he's being misled just like every single other person that's watching the mainstream media and he's so emotionally wrapped up in thinking that he's right that he's unwilling to even look at any of the positive things that Donald Trump and his administration's done can I tell you something Donald Trump is not a racist you know who was Lyndon Baines Johnson can I tell you what if Lyndon Baines Johnson was in the White House right now as the president and he was passing prison reform which was getting blacks out of prison by the thousands reuniting them with their families I would say that's amazing that's a great thing that he's done if Lyndon Baines Johnson said come to the White House so we can talk about how we can help the black community I'd say let's go see what we can do you know who else did that Martin Luther King jr. he met with him because he said you know what while I know what you are I also understand the power that you hold and if you are willing to do something they could have a positive impact on my community I'm not gonna cut you off I'm at least gonna go meet with you I'm at least gonna see what you have to say and I wanna see if maybe God is using me to get in the position of talking to you to talk some sense into you black folks don't want to do that today why don't black folks want to do that today they're brainwashed and to top it off Donald Trump ain't Linden's banged Lyndon Baines Johnson Donald Trump has done more for the african-american community the Hispanic community women in this country and America as a whole than any past president that I know of and he is gonna win again in 2020 because we all know that he's the best president that we've had in our lifetime he's gonna win in 2020 because he stands for life there's a rumbling I spoke to weeks ago in DC at the Trump Tower dr. Lance wall now he was the first one is anybody in here heard of the Cyrus effect that Trump did they they likened Donald Trump to Cyrus out of Isaiah 45 Lance wall now dr. Lance wall now a good personal friend of mine he was the first one that come out and actually make the correlation it is about a year before Trump won the election and said God spoke to him and said Isaiah 45 look at Cyrus he rebuilt the wall how many you guys know the walls going up he protected the Jewish community in today's day and age we need to protect the Jewish community and we need to protect the Christian community do you guys understand what's at stake if a Democrat was to win 2020 the emotional turmoil that has reached a boiling it's been boiling over in the mainstream media I've got videos I've got clips of different Main Street of MSNBC CNN ABC NBC Donald Trump's a racist he's a racist he's a white nationalist he he's he's anti this he all these lies they continue to spout about our president do you know what would happen if a Democrat won 20/20 before before cuz I definitely believe a civil war would ensue before that they would target every single person that has supported the president because they're gonna say we're all racists do I look like a racist how can I be racist against myself I love myself God made me beautifully you too the Bible says your beautifully and wonderfully made we should love each other and ourselves and I love myself I am NOT racist against myself and I support the President of the United States Donald J Trump that is the power and the freedom that we have in this country but if a Democrat was to win they are pushing the ball so far down the road of socialism folks that the Americans that understand what's at stake they're not giving up their guns they're not giving them up yeah try it that's exactly what I hear all the time you try to take my guns kill her Mike even said that revolt he's like black folks need to be armed so you're telling me that the administration is racist cops are racist and if you want my guts are you kidding me and yet all of that is coming from the left all of its coming from the left if a Democrat was to win in 2020 it would be a target on all of us that supported the president and I also believe it be a target on Christians the event I spoke at in DC all Christian gathering three four hundred plus live streamed there is a growing awareness that is uniting the Christian community of the ultimate fate of our nation if if Donald Trump was to not win in 2020 they are waking up they are uniting are you uniting are you woke are you trying to wake up your community are you are you afraid of the backlash of talking to a family member be honest I love that I really love that that's because y'all follow campus and you're part of Lex's that's why you know how many people I asked that to and there they shyly want to say well I try I wish I could wear my hat you want how racist the president is he shared a video of a black man wearing a Mogga trump hat sitting in seat one-eighth first class on the airplane that waited for everybody to get behind this we could turn his hat around and make sure they all saw it all the way home y'all see that video yeah that's my video the president so races he shared my video on his Instagram on his Twitter and his Facebook unfortunately the black community says well he just does that because he's trying to act like he's not so you telling me that every single thing that the prisoner has done that has a positive impact for the black community historic record low unemployment for the black community historic low of a Hispanic unemployment over 50-year low an appointment for women are you kidding me Oh what he just does that because no no no no no eventually they're gonna have to stop making excuses for being so ignorant they're gonna have to stop making excuses because he's gonna keep doing what he's doing which is making America great for all of us he doesn't care your color you know I shared this this might come out in my second book I don't know but I shared this I've met some racist folks I've met racist people you can tell you can feel it even if even if they're trying to be nice to you I had to take my girlfriend my semi-formal prom in high school I had my one of my good friends a white guy go to her house and pick her up and bring her to the dance cuz I've her daddy knew she was seeing me she wasn't going I grew up in a predominantly white area most all the black folks there were my cousins I'm serious I have met racist folks I remember one of the first times I don't even know it was racism at first I was on a water slide I was at the very top I was waiting to go down the slide and I was maybe 12 years old like maybe this tall I sneezed and like a good boy like my mama taught me to you say excuse me as soon as I said excuse me a taller white man looked down at me and said there is no excuse for you I felt that in my heart I didn't know why at first I felt that in my heart like that was just so ugly and uncalled for unnecessary you don't even know me I didn't have anybody with me that backed me up I just had to deal with it later on I told a friend of mine and he said I bet she was racist I said that makes sense I've met some racist folks that's just one I've met some racist folks I've met the President of the United States Donald J Trump three times I have never felt anything but love and respect from that man when he shakes my hand each time I met him I got to shake his hand the last time I got to take a selfie with him I actually got a selfie video I was like I'm not just clipping this I'm a video the whole thing I got a selfie video with the president not one time have I felt any type of ill intent hatred evil which is racism from that man he stepped out of his private life multi-billionaire life to fight for you and for me because just like he told Oprah almost 30 years ago if it gets so bad if it gets so bad that I have to run then I'll run where was t I and all these people call him a racist when they were all going to his parties where was the mainstream media call him a racist when they were talking about how amazing he was the business mobile mr. apprentice mr. universe all the things that he had no they weren't it's when he chose to run on a platform that is against the propaganda arm of the Democrat Party that's when it all happened so I'm thankful for blech sit I'm thankful for you I'm thankful to be alive at this moment and time in history are you thankful to be alive at this moment in time in history you are the ones that have the power to help make sure that Donald J Trump stays elected stays our president gets reelected and continues to give us another four years you are the ones I believe God appointed him chose him but we're the ones that have to put in the work are you ready to put in the work are you ready to put in the work then together we're going to keep America great David J Harris jr. god bless you [Music]", "tXOHchFcyEA": "there are countries and there are states and right now California is a state this is what happens when there's too much liberalism liberals ruin everything okay next speaker is is running for mayor in in Pasadena I met him in a really interesting way which he's going to tell you about but his discussion and what you're going to talk about tonight is what the hell is going on in Los Angeles please welcome to the stage major Williams let me give you my version of the black said you see how the stands are empty and then a little bit and a little bit more and more and more starts to fill up the word gets out publication store getting written by us people store hey what's up everyone people store thinking it's not real but these all that no especially was filling up now people get nervous now people paying attention because they see that we are free thinkers and we are not afraid to be ourselves and this is the reason why not by myself us together we shall black see what's up for everyone everyone looking good I love the shirts I love the logos I want to start out like give you guys a disclaimer I feel not really offended but I'm the rookie of group and the fact that I had to follow Brandon Ingram like this is it's a Brandon Tatum Ingram Lakers it's just enough so his energy is always amazing he's been a great mentor to be able to watch him to watch him grow to watch him blossom I think that everyone that supported LexA crewman is there the epitome of inclusion and this is what we've been missing as a culture as a city as a state and as a country and so just to be honest with you if I'm being honest of course I got to be honest up here because you can fact check these days we need no fake news I was a life lifelong Democrat you know my grandmother was a Democrat my mother was a Democrat and so just naturally by default without questioning why I was a democratise world to him not until I started getting around different different groups different people who had different perspectives and differently but instead of calling him crazy which is what a lot of people tend to do with a lot of us in this room I stuck to my guns and I stayed hanging around those people and I want to share a quick story with you guys before I get into more issues that I feel like that's going on here in Los Angeles is my story how I became a part of Blacks it came from me actually going at Candis Owens imagine that so as I'm running for mayor announced last year 2018 and I was working with different advisors and they kept saying you need to meet this girl named Candace Orange you need to you need to follow her you can either get in touch with her she's a black conservative she's great she's awesome she's all this I say wait I'm already married don't give me all these great details about so long story short I go to the YouTube videos I go to Twitter and I and I look good liquor up and I'm starting to see like the culture of how she's posting in the content she's posting in she's really galvanized and she's just such a force of nature right you guys agree let me hear you say yeah absolute force of nature and so I'm looking at it and I'm I'm understanding more and more and I'm starting to do research on my own no different than a lot of you guys I hear today and I'm starting to wake up and I'm starting to wake up and I'm starting to wake up and then one day I say you know what I'm woke and so with anything always challenged myself to not follow people blindly I took the horse blinders off and no different than we can this orange I said you know what I truly don't know her or a total background or who she truly is or whatever I need to know a little bit more before I just totally dive in and just wave the flag for black sick and Candis owns etc and so I did a video I put it on Twitter and I saved my plate you know I had my head on my red head make America great all that good stuff and I was like you know she's saying all this good stuff oh she will no yes she can be faking she's an implant she could have wrote me off like a troll she could not respond to me she has millions of followers at that time with my new page I had like 200 some followers right she could have blocked me she could the muted me she could have did all those different things so she decided not to at me she jumped in my DM how about that Candace Owens jumped in my DM and the conversation went like this amazingly civil respectful and elegant was her rebuttal and it made me think even further I said if I can say certain things and push back and question some of the things that I feel like I wanted to question in a person had this kind of civility that's the type of person I want to be around that's the type of person that shows leadership qualities of a movement that I would like to be a part of it helped foster and promote it and acknowledge all over the world and that's why I'm here today and that's why you are here today that's why we are here today and that's why I decided to blex it so that's my story so typically I don't do this but I have a whole bag of money right here so what I want to do is if anybody wants a whole bag of money all you have to do is just come to the stage and grab it all right now don't spin out in one place all right all right now here's here's the kicker can you open that back and save me what's in that bag dum dum dum [Music] absolutely dive in what's in that bag what's in that box it's a box okay what's in a box okay this team working here I gave her a pair of brand new pair of shoes what you guys just witnessed is what Democrats have done to us for years and years and years and years and years and years [Applause] am i lying I'm not lying I've seen it over and over again the same lies the same policies put in place no different than the policies that they're put in place here right in Los Angeles we're dealing with homelessness at an all-time rate at seventy five percent that is crazy to me the fact that we have individuals that are smart creative and innovation but we won't come together or our politicians that we elect to put in these places won't come together and work for an efficient problem for efficient come up with a solution for the problems that we have with our city I don't know if you guys know this story but this story really hit me at home I have two young sons one named Carlo he's eight years old my other son is named Lord he's two years old and it resonated with me because I do have kids and have another one on my way my beautiful wife is over here championing me on and the and the story was about this the drug syringes that are all over are all over our city there was a young girl she was six years old mistakenly put one in her mouth thinking it was a thermometer now mind you these are for heroin heroin addicts whatever kind of thing is going on hepatitis and all these different diseases going on and she got very ill those are the things that we are dealing with in California that's just one story there was another 11 year old girl swimming in the public pool enjoying herself with her friends and her family and had a syringe go through the bottom of her foot so just imagine being in a public office and I can't imagine because this is what I'm what I'm striving to do to be in these public office to do the best good I possibly can especially when I am made aware of things that are going on in my city imagine being in that office and you're getting this information about what's going on in these cities and you are not actively or proactively doing something to stop these things happening to our current in our city but we voted for you you asked what votes you got our attention you round us up but yet you're sitting idle why these things you to help them that's not fair to me that's not fair to you that's not fair to your kids it's not fair to our city our state or our country because this is happening all over the place so recently I was downtown I went with a good friend of mine he was actually running for lieutenant governor California I was working on his campaign and we went down two feet to homelessness and I was talking to one of the homeless community leaders that was down there and it was something that I didn't know anything about totally and he said you know what the real issue is this the real issue is that we're having a lot of people come to California because they hear the word sanction change so we're receding has unintended consequences and I said my god what does that mean I didn't know I'm intelligent I'm smart I'm educated but I didn't know what he meant by that he said there are people coming from Arizona Colorado Ohio Texas just to be homeless in downtown LA Wow I didn't know that why because they have resources they're gonna get showers and yet they're gonna get rewarded for the behavior that they're continuing to have and that has to stop so if you are a la resident I urge you to be active it's going to be on each one of you guys individually to start voting just they'll start sharing the message collectively so we can actually activate our city for the benefit of all of us moving forward being the rookie that I am I don't have the same amount of time as Brandon Tatum but I personally just want to say thank you to Candace and everybody that's involved in this flexing movement I want to tell you guys that stay engaged stay engaged stay alert stay aware continue to love each other so we can foster good vibes and really do some productive work together this is what we've all imagined everybody being right here today my name is major Williams and I'm out don't you [Music]", "Krxb7rqVSn4": "and now without further ado please give a warm welcome to former arizona police officer and radio host brandon tatum [Music] what's going on that's what's going on hey I want y'all to give candy zones another round of applause the queen bee baby leading the charge but I also want you to give yourselves a round

popular I might I might so I'm gonna do that I'm gonna read just for you let's get into this those are the people that watch my youtube channel so but some of you guys may not know who I am don't know where I come from so I'm gonna give you a quick synopsis of who baked potato mears for those of you don't know I wasn't always like this I wasn't always the beet ate them with it with a blazer on speaking in front of people I don't curse them none of my videos I wasn't always that guy but what changed me was my relationship with God and I think that's very that's very important I went from smoking marijuana at eight years old even earlier than that I actually went to juvenile for smoking marijuana in a vacant house I got jumped in the game around that same age I had a terrible attitude even though I had a scholarship to the University of Arizona my senior year I got kicked out of school from throwing the chair of the teacher I didn't do well in college my first couple years although I was a tremendous athlete because I cussed at my coaches I blew up on them and all of those things was the beginning but God saw something different for me and in 2008 I got saved and for some of y'all acts 2:38 and being baptized with the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues some of that that means something some of y'all y'all know y'all know y'all on my office tonic folk out there but the reason I do these speeches and the reason I'm so passionate is because I believe that Americans of African descent have the ability to be greater in this country I'm not I'm not I'm not fooled into believing that all of us are poor all of us are you know selling drugs that's not true there's a lot of successful folks but I believe that we can do better I believe that this country belongs to us just like anybody else and there comes a time where you have to stand up this is not the time to cower this is not the time to back in the corner this is not the time to let people's opinions affect what you believe it's the time to stand and don't stand on falsehoods don't stand on somebody else's shoulder it's time for you to stand on the truth time for you to stand for what you know what you've been researching and the passion that comes out of beat Tatum comes from the truth all I do is speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God I almost messed it up right there but y'all know what I'm saying but I think our community needs to focus on introspection and I say this all day long before we point the finger at somebody else make sure you're doing what you're supposed to do at home and I say this to people who who I know who still sell drugs before you point the finger at the white man the one that you say has oppressed you are you still selling dope do you love your brother like you say you do are you calling me a  on TV before you point the finger make sure you doing what you're supposed to do make sure your heart right before you get in line and say black lives matter make sure they really matter to you what bothers me is people have become so complacent and fake and I'm not telling my child cause y'all perfect I'm somebody somebody else they fall down the path of complacency they listen to certain music follow certain actors certain characters who really are not working in their best interests and we see that in pop culture and we see it in politics and I am in no way here to tell you how you should vote I don't care if you Republican Democrat any of that stuff do not matter what matters is is that you understand the principles in which you stand on and the people that you go out and vote for they better doggone reflect those principles or they don't get your vote there is non-negotiables there's non-negotiables I believe in God and I believe God has a plan for us and if you don't believe in God today that's fine that's fine you might want to look him up because when you look at the history when you look at the people who were slaves in this country who brought them out it was God it was their faith the foundation of the United States of America faith when you looked at Lincoln and you look at all these people God is present in everything they wrote in all of the foundational beliefs the morals of this country was rooted in Christ and that's one of the pillars we have to stand on I was talking to a gentleman behind the stage and I think one of the things we have to remember as well is the is the alignment that God want us in the reason that where we struggle sometimes it's because we don't align properly before God the Bible says Jesus is the head of the church the man is the head of the household I'm for the priests where my offering plate [Applause] the one of the solutions to the problems that we see is that we got to line it up right the men in our community need to get in their rightful position nothing against the women God makes you strong clearly some women are racist you know single parents raising young boys to be great men but didn't eat the way God wanted to be God want the man to be there young brothers got to step up and be in their position so you can be in right alignment that God can bless our lineage I'm for the preached and this may shock some people this is why abortion to me is so wrong what if Ben Carson's mama said you know what I ain't got no money right now and uh I don't know where his daddy and I can't even really good so I'm so I'm gonna decide to terminate Ben Carson because of my own personal beliefs but she didn't do that she said i'ma have my baby anyway and I'm gonna trust a guy gonna make it better if I can't do nothing about it God I'll make it better and what do you know one of the greatest men to ever live his mom gave him life and he's done so much for people what if he wasn't here what if everybody in this room what if your parent decided and they're gonna put their own selfishness over your your life your success my grandmother was raped at 12 years old and she had my mama they chose life because that life led to me and my brother led to me standing on this stage right here proclaiming truth and I believe that things and is that those are little things they add up to a lot I believe that abortion pulls young men out of their position as well because man you got a scapegoat you can sleep around do whatever you want y'all like that you leave her and then you expect her to go to the clinic and then she don't go to the clinic like you expect now that baby don't have a daddy that's it's not right it took two to tango if you can lay down you can be a daddy and I wanna I want to talk about policing for a minute because I was a I'm a former police officer shoutout to law enforcement in the military in the house y'all get him around applause god bless you one of the biggest lies that have been told to us it's our relationship what our relationship should be when it comes to law enforcement I understand I'm an educated man I understand that there are things that have happened in the past that lead people down a path of feeling some type of way about policing in America feel some type of way about government but the difference is it's not reasonable to pass down past trauma right just because my great grandmother dealt with police in a certain way don't mean I have to just because back in the day people were prejudiced and racists against black people in the South don't mean that I have to receive that my experience with law enforcement have been positive and I've worked with law enforcement and I met cops all over the country and I can sit here with a straight face and from my heart most police officers are just trying to do what's right all I wanted to do was to make it home to my son all I wanted to do was make sure my mama didn't have to come to my funeral it had nothing to do it race and another principle that I stood on was that I wanted to make a difference and serve that's what I wanted to do that's God's calling for all of us it's to serve the principles that we forget about when you want it when you think about success and I want money I want this is that you need to think about serving first serve your community serve the people that matter and God will accelerate your success and I'm gonna say this too because yesterday I had a speech it didn't go like I wanted it to go corine give a shout out to my fiancee Korean right in the front fellas that's what real man do well you know you pull the trigger all right you get married that's what she's supposed to do all right let me move on so Korean was supporting me I went to an event my father had the event my stepmom and father they put it on every year in Waco Texas and it's to benefit the black community they have leaders from all over the country come and speak about things that can benefit you right how to build your credit how to build your brand and social media and different things like that the empower the young people unfortunately every year the turnout is terrible the only people there are the people who are scheduled to teach and maybe five other people that signed up that was supposed to be today I'm supposed to talk to but I get there they're six feet six young people in the front it's all black only it was two white people in there my baby there and then another guy I think he's running for Congress so I started with this premise and I don't want to get into politics but I started with this premise I said how many of you guys voted everybody raise your hand I said how many of you are satisfied with who you voted for hardly nobody raised their hand Korean raised our hand cuz we know how she voted but Korea raised her hand she was satisfied then I said how many people voted for ex-parte and everybody raised their hand I said how many people people voted for it the other party Korean is only one raise her hand she bowed she bowed y'all I could do a whole thing about her right now but then I said how many people are in the middle and nobody raised their hand my point in doing that they got mad automatically because they knew I was going my point in doing that is that if you're not satisfied with who you've elected because of you know your vote then why you're still voting in the same direction why you still support people who don't support you and I'm gonna tell you another point where they got mad at me I start to tell the truth about their particular party I said you know what I still did my research and I can no longer support people that don't support my mission they don't support me and they have never supported me and I went through the history Cougars Klan Jim Crow segregation when I honor lady walked out she walked out the back and the same lady that said when she first met me she go god bless you I love your mama your daddy God is going I'm gonna pray for you and she walked out the back when I start telling true I know God ain't and I don't know she know God or not but at the end of all of that it hurt me a little bit if it bothered me because the worst school district in the state of Texas is in this same city and Waco this small area wake up one of the poorest districts in the whole city is in that one area and they couldn't even listen to another side they wrote me off at the very beginning but one thing I remember and I think it's invaluable for everybody to know is that I guarantee you I planted a seed and that's what it's all about all of you guys your mission is to plant a seed just like in the Bible just like spirituality your mission is the plan of see you may not convert people right away matter of fact half of the people that confront you and see what side you own or whatever the case may be they may reject you immediately dust your shoulders off go on to the next person and understand that you're planting a seed that will eventually grow and the reason why I say that that's true is because it happened to me I was one way grew up this way you couldn't tell me nothing got on the police department everybody was the other way and they told me they say Brandon how could you support this side when you were Christian when you believe in certain things that are non-negotiable and they don't believe in it and eventually this one guy that was up there y'all saw his face lying talking about he doing stuff for the black community y'all know who he is Barry I call him Barry and he messed around and told the truth his true colors came out he spoke so poorly about law enforcement he spoke poorly about officers and he made my job more dangerous because people begin to believe the rhetoric on television even though I'm black they would attack me they mad at me I'm a traitor I had a guy I pulled a guy over in the middle of the night he had 0% 10th and he said you just put me over cuz I'm black I'm like fool I'm black better stop and then he looked Hispanic anyway I'm like bro you don't even look black I had thought that joking hair but so I saw the attacks that came and they were hurtful and I said I never support anybody I'm come with party line y'all care you mom mom Anil I don't support nobody that won't stand up for the men and women who wear the uniform and those of you who know my social media you know I get along with it and I say I'm about to be over there's another thirty minutes of talking but I'm gonna actually wrap it up and I'm gonna wrap it up with this I want you guys to remain diligent I want you to remain courageous every single person in here every single person you have a mission and it takes us all working together to make it work I'm on the stage you guys are supporting someone y'all gonna be on the same stage at some point some of you guys can write some of you guys make videos some of you guys have your own talents the things that God has blessed you with but you have to exercise it you have to pursue it not one of us is bigger than person Candace as popular as there is you know what I'm popular to other people who speak of very popular but you guys are just as valuable no matter where you stand on the spectrum because God needs every single person to use what your gift is to pursue the goal no matter where you come from no matter where you're going we're all Americans at the end of the day i'ma say this and I'm really done people criticize this event sometimes they criticize they said all the white people in there any black people I wish they'd stop being fake half on work for white people too so what I'm saying what I want to say is we need each other it rates don't matter at the end of the day we're all children of God and the reason why we see diversity and not just one color it's because we understand that we need one another we understand that we work better together Harriet Tubman to get nowhere by self anyway I appreciate you guys I love you guys thank you that's my time enjoy the rest of the show

Lincoln himself quoted more than 150 years ago you work I eat and if they keep you poor what are they able to do to you now control you and that's power and there comes a time will you have to stand

years and years was going to replace the old guard so to speak the Al Sharpton's of the world there's a lot of good that happened from the six East till now but it's tired it's worn out everything I hear about from the current Democratic Party is more like victimization I'm just sick and tired of every time there's a Black History Month it's about what has happened to us what has been done to us badly rather than what we have done the majority of middle-class blacks now have college degrees and we have houses we have cars we're not government dependent I think the old leaders have have used race and racism to create generational PTSD where the current generation is reacting in the present as if those things that happen to pass are still happening to them Lex it's like finally I mean I

really and truly mirroring what you care about the most for those who don't have an answer so what is it about them that you vote that you care about what what do you support tell me one thing that you support and most of them don't have an answer so get them thinking about that you know challenge challenge these preconceived ideas that you have a forget in the facts it's more to think for yourself read and repeat the things you've always heard and to react emotionally to cries of racism the cries of the man's holding us back I didn't get this because of this it's just a lot easier to

so proud of ourselves and that's natural in the human Spirit we want to achieve we're naturally Achievers but when you arrive in a generation we're really kind of you got it right we're civilized we

signs", "qlNO4jjEOIk": "ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage author and radio host larry elder [Music] [Applause] wow nobody took a knee [Applause] you know this whole narrative about the police how to get black people the whole thing is complete and total bs you know there don't you i'm in l.a and uh the the coach of the clippers named doc rivers he just got fired after um a loss sits down to the table with a stat sheet goes over exactly what happened with the game goes over all the stats blocks assists field throw percentage three-point percentage how many steals there were all this stuff because in order to succeed in his profession he has to connect the dots and be logical george floyd dies jacob lake gets shot what does doc river say has a press conference he goes uh oh why does this keep happening lebron james armin arbury gets killed lebron james tweets out and says black people are afraid to leave their homes same guy after the game whether he loses or wins sits down and illegally goes over exactly what happened who did what who did what wrong very logical connects the dots use the stats when it comes to this oh why does this keep happening where does that same mine apply to this the same mind would be asking things like let's see how many times do the police interact with civilians every year 50 million times out of that how many people are arrested every year 11 million how many cops are assaulted 60 000 how many civilians are killed by the police out of a population of 350 million 1 000 almost all of them resisting arrest with the weapon are resisting arrest violently when you get down to white cops killing unarmed black people of that 1 thousand you're talking about less than four percent of the total and unarmed does not mean not dangerous michael brown was unarmed but his dna was found on the officer's gun so he was reasonably perceived as a threat of the cops who were killed last year were 60 of them 40 of them were killed by blacks of the homicides in this country 50 percent are black victims almost all of the black victims are killed by other blacks so you're looking at a handful of unarmed blacks killed last year 25 versus 7 000 blacks killed mostly by other blacks last year but they don't care about that they just care about it when a white cop kills a black person that's when they care do you know there are more unarmed whites killed every year than unarmed blacks name one media couldn't care less it's designed to manipulate you to make you angry and democrats want you to be angry and pull that lever for the for the democrats at 95 because of the perception of racial injustice on the part of cops and the perception that democrats care about that republicans don't we are being manipulated hollywood does it too i'm just talking to a gentleman from paterson new jersey anybody see the movie hurricane starring denzel washington the movie was about a man wrongfully convicted of murdering three people except he was not wrongfully convicted of murdering three people he murdered three people there's a website called graphicwitness.com carter you can read he flunked the polygraph test there was eyewitness testimony and if you saw the movie there's a character who says in response to somebody who says well he got convicted by two juries and the character says all white juries false the second jury had two blacks on it the reason i mention this is because you are being manipulated there are two films that came out about the central park five won by ken burns one by ava duvernay both of them complete and total bs i interviewed the lead detective by the way who happened to be black neither one of them interviewed the lead detective how do you do a film without interviewing the lead detective how do you do that and her doctor if you recall what happened a guy named uh matthias reyes claims he's the one who did it his dna was found at the crime scene but the doctor her doctor said there was lots of dna inside of her lots of semen inside of her several people did it not just this one guy she did not include him in the film and she said she didn't believe him you didn't believe her doctor you are being manipulated and when it comes to black white white black murder twice as many white people are killed by blacks as the other way around most homicide is same race homicide but to the extent that there is black white white black homicide last year there were 750 500 whites were killed by blacks 250 blacks were killed by whites so blacks are killing twice as many whites as wives to killing blacks and if you talk look about non-homo violent crime black white roughly 600 000 interracial acts of violent crime every year excluding homicide 85 to 90 of the time it is a black perp only 10 to 15 of the time uh it's the other way around why where's white white lies matter we are being manipulated that's right the number one problem facing the black community is not racist cops it's not income inequality it's not climate change the number one problem facing the black community is the lack of fathers in the home seventy percent of black kids are raised without fathers and forget about elder barack obama said a kid raised without a father is five times more likely to be poor and commit crime nine times more likely to drop out of school 20 times more likely to end up in jail now the question is why have we gone from 25 percent of black kids born outside the wedlock in 1965 to 70 today and the answer is it's the welfare state the welfare state is incentivizing women to marry the government and allowing men to abandon their financial and moral responsibility and that's what we ought to be talking about but we're not having that conversation because again they are manipulating us they want us to think about racism racism racism i thought that we put a fork in that when barack obama got elected in 2008 i mean this is a man who got a higher percentage of the white vote then john kerry did four years earlier and by the way donald trump got a lower percentage of the white vote than mitt romney did four years earlier and about this bs about donald trump sending a racist dog whistle to his supporters riddle me this the city over 100 000 that voted most for donald trump is abilene texas the city is about 140 years old guess which city of 140 years old just elected a black mayor abilene texas now how does a how does a racist city that pull the lever for donald trump turn around and then vote for a black mayor overwhelmingly to run the town how does that happen there were 700 counties that voted for obama in 2008 2012. 200 of them switched to donald trump in 2016. when were they bitten by the racist radioactive spider we are being manipulated this is a country where you can realize your potential to the greatest degree in all of human history and we ought to be doing that this is a party the democratic party that opposes school choice i went to a school called crenshaw high school you saw the movie boys in the hood that's my high school right now three percent of kids in my former high school can do math at grade level three percent that's not a typo three percent and it's a school meaning it's run by the gang called the crips i know that because ice t went there ten years after i did and told me he wanted to go to crenshaw because he wanted to go to school what there are 13 public high schools in baltimore where zero percent of the kids can do math at grade level zero there's another half a dozen where one percent can now what parent sends their kid to a school where zero percent of kids can do math at grade level if they have a choice the answer is nobody does but the democrat party is mandated your kid is going to go there whether you like it or not republican party wants to give you choice finally illegal immigration there's a harvard professor named george borja he's probably done more work on the impact of legal and illegal immigration than anybody else and there are winners and losers behind illegal immigration obviously the winners are the illegal aliens themselves and people who employ them at lower wages and they would play american workers the big loser unskilled black and brown workers living in the inner city who have to compete for jobs they would otherwise hold and whose wages are put downward because of the availability of illegal wages donald trump is doing something about illegal immigration the democratic party couldn't care less donald trump supports public choice in school the democratic party couldn't care less yet the black people go in there like lemmings and pull that lever 95 for a party that is denying your child an opportunity to get the best possible education that doesn't care at all about the competition posed by illegal alien workers we need to wake up nobody had a tougher life than my father nobody my father was kicked out of the house he was 13 years old athen georgia at the beginning of the great depression jim crow south he has had a single mom who was irresponsible had a bunch of boyfriends my dad comes home one day at the age of 13 quarrels with his mom's then boyfriend she sides with the boyfriend kicks my father out of the house never to return my father became a janitor became a pullman porter he joined the marines if anybody had a reason to be angry at the world it's somebody like my father my father's generation my father told my brothers and me the same thing all the time hard work wins you get out of life what you put into it you cannot control the outcome but damn it you are 100 in control of the effort and before you moan about what somebody did to you look at the mirror and say to yourself what could i have done to change the outcome and finally my father always told my brothers and me sooner or later bad things are going to happen how you respond to those bad things will tell your mother and me if we raised a man knowledge is power do not let them manipulate you may god bless america and may god continue to bless you guys and donald trump thank you", "93ZZLN2D3AY": "you're something you're passionate about

"fact from 1620 to 1865 the bodies of african-american men and women were enslaved in America fear is now 2017 and the minds of these males and females are now sleeved my name is Kenneth Owens and you are watching my vlog series and this is a tune in made of 2016 I escaped the Democrats plantation of thought and I will provide the rest of you guys at home watching what a guide how to ready the first thing you're going to need is internet access and a cell phone or computer second thing you're going to need is your free I'll give you guys a couple of seconds together that second item says it seems to be low on stock these days every four years Democrats rally to get the african-american vote and we give it to them because well Republicans are racist right we usher them straight into the White House where they eat immediately forget about all the promises that they made to us our blind allegiance to the Democratic Party stems from around the 1960s a Martin Luther King sat in a prison cell and then hopeful President John F Kennedy made a phone call to his wife Coretta Scott he did everything he could to get Martin Luther King out of prison and would eventually introduce a civil rights bill in 1963 and a story that's it hang it up I mean obviously that is proof that the Democrats weren't racist they were absolutely crucial and out long determination with this bill and things were automatically desegregated the end vote Democrat until you die right wrong excuse that textbook doesn't tell you that the Democrats are actually the ones that imposed segregation and they were the ones majorly against voting to desegregate our communities in both the 1950s and the 1960s oh and those Klansmen that you guys are freaking out about look under the hood they were all Democrats yes Democrats were the ones that were lynching african-american people by 1922 black Republicans served in the US Congress the Democrats didn't elect a single one until 1935 pop quiz do you guys know what the first movie that was ever screened at the White House was anybody it was a movie entitled in the Klan and it was screened by President Woodrow Wilson all four Democrats but the Civil Rights Act can this come on it doesn't matter two Democratic presidents did that they sure did oddly enough that act was also followed by a string of protests in the north and african-american people do you know why because it was basically smoke and mirrors there was still police brutality and it still allows for discrimination in employment meaning black people still couldn't get jobs and make a living oh but your textbooks say that everything was dandy after that so hey don't believe me - the problem is that african-americans have not yet developed an apparatus to make Democrats make good on their promises once they are in the office so instead what do we do we complain about it for four years and then we get right back on the wheel we are literally like hamsters on a wheel well I remember my mother's funny I thought I was going places 100 members are so weird my my mother my mother said stop the madness literal hamster mentality is what African Americans are suffering from each and every time they invest in a Democratic candidate I mean there's no one else the wheels maybe no I had a hamster and he pops that freaking wheel rest in peace buster vote for us we love black people wait a second can you say that four years ago but I mean yeah but you can't vote for the other guys the racist the african-american community is suffering from a poor memory with a healthy spoonful of indoctrination I mean from the time that we are embraced where we are told Democrats good Republicans that we repeat that ad nauseam without ever stopping and just researching do you want to know why Democrats who own the media are working so tirelessly to tell you if you ever or against up you are going to be widget up one day with Klansmen surrounding you because if they lost even 25% of the African American vote they would be in deep trouble all of their globalist efforts would die seriously in fact that's why they're working overtime to also marginalize other groups like transgender people and gay people they are scaring everybody at every corner the mission is simple guys divide and conquer up Rita both and that one that was handed to you purposefully during your free education through to high school your education wasn't three paid for it with your mind your mind has been completely shackled by utter lies and a false reality remember that infamous Alabama Birmingham protests where black people were being posed and dogs were sent on them Democrats sent those dogs and those hoses remember after Brown versus the do we Supreme Court decisions when troops arrived to a scored little girls into school in Arkansas the white the Eisenhower sent those troops but don't mind that part because he's a Republican doesn't count kun kun those are the comments that I receive

make me come back to the plantation it lost your minds our current president has been accused of being a lot of things anti-semitic among them such as pretty interesting that there are no Jews lined up so in Yama comes out the White House for rioting like fools in the street do I know why that is it's because they're educated and they know for a fact that he is not anti-semitic and he is no one to fear African Americans we do all the dirty work for the Democrats there's no word for Uncle Tom and the Jewish community because they know now one of their people makes it outside and actually sees reality the rest of them better follow up so you can follow me or you can people in the figurative cotton I will not be offended either way I mean I wasn't going to comment today and someone called me a Bedouin team elephant is country I wake up even just five black people I have done my job talking about launching the movement let those five then wake up another five until every person the African

just been flat largely due of course to the incentives of planned parenthood um and so they're really looking to import a new voting block and doing exactly what they did to black america uh you know at the end of the 1950s which is just incentivizing them with handouts right here's free stuff welfarism that kicked off under lbj and the great society act and i can see them saying wow that worked with black america we got them married to government and thereby married to us the democrat party but now we need more of that so we're going to import these people they're already offering them free

Black America has harmed Black America I like to say there's something about Progressive principles that always lead to aggressive results for minority communities that's just something I've realized they're always pretending they're going to help when in fact they're hurting because what the left believes in and what the left relies on is a permanent underclass this is why they harp so much on

are happening right now on the left because right now what we are seeing taking place in this country is honestly a struggle between light and darkness between God and Satan okay this is there is not a time that black Americans Latino Americans Asian Americans I don't Brazilian Americans need to find their voice more okay I know it can be scary I know what it's like when you look at your own friends and your own family and people that you grew up with and they tell you that you're crazy and that you're a racist but I'm telling you at this country right now right if the left wins we are not going to recognize this country anymore that is the truth what we are talking about and what they are after are Marxist principles they are right now teaching in school critical race Theory the left is reintroducing the same segregation that they had decades ago okay they are looking they are looking to Foster race hate when they see a crowd like this this makes them nervous yesterday I had pretty much every news agency in America contacting me asking me about this event the first two questions they wanted to ask me they didn't want to ask what this was about they didn't want to ask why so many minority Americans were showing up DC in support of law enforcement they wanted to ask who funds you they're already working on a narrative that you guys are paid protesters to be here okay yeah ridiculous they said how could they afford to all come to D.C who's funding this movement okay because they genuinely do not believe that blacks and Latinos can make decisions outside of the leftist indoctrination right when they're expecting so many of us to abide and be emotional and watch the images on the screen and say oh my gosh oh my gosh that could be me I have to get up I have to Riot and loot and burn down my own neighborhood then they wanted to ask me about covid-19 if you saw me on Twitter you saw how I dealt with that we are not if you see any press asking you a question about covid-19 you can tell them to shut their mouths okay we're not those kind of minorities that are so stupid that we're gonna play a part in your narrative that you are trying to attack this President and pretend that he is responsible for a pandemic right we demand a more honest conversation about what is happening in inner city communities in places like New York City where shootings are up over 200 percent from this time last year because they are actively defunding parts of the police police officers you they actually said oh here's what we need to do uh we want uh Community Development we walk I don't walk Community organization I want the police saw your community collaboration Community Center when there's an issue if someone breaks into my home I want somebody that is armed and on the side of the law okay if I'm facing an emergency and I'm facing an issue I want to be able to call police officers I don't want to call Community organizers or take a new look at it I was disgusted when I was watching these debates of our country you know we are not we don't endorse explicitly any candidate at brexit but I will say that watching these debates are you guys watching them make some noise if you're watching these debates it would seem to me they only care about two things right covid-19 right because 200 000 Americans have been killed by coven 19. where was that energy when hundreds of black Americans and Hispanic Americans die every single weekend in inner cities you want me to be afraid of covid-19 you want these people who in one day can watch 60 people shot in their neighborhood on the south side of Chicago right and you don't ask any questions about that they say you're not allowed to talk about black on black crime right you're not allowed to talk about it it's racist to have that conversation they want to talk about a pandemic but they don't want to talk about the issues that are going on in our communities they want us to be afraid of police officers I think this year nine unarmed black men just so you guys have the facts on your side uh were shot and killed by police officers that's less than white Americans that's less than Hispanic Americans and yet this narrative that you're seeing you would think right according to the news stations today that black Americans if we right now are sitting here police officers are lining up they just want to kill us for no reason right that that is the narrative that is out there today is that happening no if you're a minority American you have a higher chance of being struck by lightning okay then killed unarmed by a police officer so why are they doing this why are they doing this why are they doing any of this why do we have the left attacking not just police officers attacking men in general This Modern feminist movement boys can be women women can be men confusing our children right why are they doing this I'll tell you while they're why they're doing this what all of this is about what all of this Marxism is about and you're right it is evil if you read Karl Marx you know that he was an avowed racist but he understood something very very simple if you want government to be omnipotent if you want to grow government if you watch socialism which means that the government becomes God in your life you have to undo everything in a person's life that gives them structure so that means they attack Faith they mock Christians they mock people who pray they don't want you saying the Pledge of Allegiance right they don't want you now they're saying oh you can't sing um the national anthem anymore it's racist what are you crazy in fact when we get to the White House we should sing the national anthem while all the cameras are there there will be no kneeling at a Blackson event right they want to remove that they want you to hate that they want to destroy families very simple if you don't want there to be a strong family structure what easier way than to say men don't be men fathers don't live in the home we don't need men anymore that's toxic masculinity that's a phrase that is developed to take away and to attack manhood like there is something wrong with being a man because they know that there is no society that can survive without strong men right and then they tell women there's something wrong with you if you don't support these crazy modern blue-haired feminists who are squealing about everything I want nothing to do with you because you're not even a strong woman right the second vice president Pence defeated Kamala Harris on point what did they do what did they do sex is a misogyny right that's weakness that's weakness we need strong women and we need strong men but most importantly we need strong families we are facing an epidemic in the minority community of broken down families rotted by a welfare system that was put into place by a vowed racists a welfare system that knocked on the doors of homes of minority homes and said we are the government we're here to help the government is never here to help right we are the government and we will give you more money if your black father does not live in the home if your father is outside of the home this is why the curse in minority America is Father absence it is kids growing up it's the baby mama culture it's the WAP culture let me tell you something I'm not trying to be cool to hang out with these rappers that culture has destroyed our communities okay [Applause] talking about empowerment as a woman because you take your clothes off you feel empowered if you have to take your clothes off to be heard you are not empowered you are enslaved okay every day and they will tell you oh well you don't you don't understand Black Culture you don't understand Latino culture you don't you don't understand I'm not trying to understand this I don't want I don't want to read a book on how you've confused enslavement with empowerment stop pretending by the way that what we see today in America amongst these athletes amongst these singers amongst these stars is what culture always was to the minority community when I grew up and I grew up in my grandparents house we were listening to The Temptations okay men that were wearing suits dancing a little bit like this singing about family Diana Ross the Jackson 5. these people were not singing about putting their bodies out they didn't want dressing in the way that we are told that women have to dress and they commanded respect they cared about family values they want to convince us that the problem and the reasons and the statistics that exist that show that there is a disparity between white and blacks and and whites and Latinos exists because of some crazy idea that their systemic or racism and oppression no there's not there is a broken culture a broken culture that we can are never going to get ahead of unless we have Brave minorities like the people here today that are willing to speak up speak out and tell the truth we are now the problem we have to fix it we don't need to look externally we know how to get ahead in this country this is the freest country in the entire world right you have to work hard you have to stay out of trouble you have to make good decisions you have to keep your family don't have children out of wedlock if you can that increases your chances of not living a life of poverty right these are basic decisions that impact all Americans no matter what color you are do not fall for the propaganda and the lies and the brainwashing of the media right people are telling me telling you to be afraid of covid-19 because it's killed 200 000 people well I have a bigger fear it's called socialism it's killed a hundred million people in the last 100 years and they're trying to bring into America right if I catch covid-19 I'll survive that I know I know I'll survive that I'm young right I probably won't survive of the socialist country of the left is trying to build right which gives the government full power full money and people actually believe this stuff that everything can be free I know where am I Cuban Americans right you you guys know what socialism has done people the Venezuela switch know what socialism has done do not let them bring that satanic notion to this free and beautiful and blessed country [Music]", "h-v1v80URdU": "start talking about abortion

we're not growing latino population is going up the white population is going up the black population is stagnated you know what that means it means that the democrats looking for a new voter block because we're going to be irrelevant and who's that new voter bloc open borders everyone they want open borders because they want illegals to replace black people in this country when someone tells me

"there's such a lack of understanding of what's actually going on in America in terms of the race conflict and it is purely manufactured by the media and it is encouraged by the Democrat Party who wants people to vote based on emotionality and on no basis of fact and in particular seeing the protests that were going on in the UK about racism and black lives matter an organization is not for black Americans it's an organization that raised billions of millions of dollars from white people that feel guilty and believe that there's you know racial oppression in America for black Americans because the media tells them so and of course the media never lies Nigel as you know the media never ever lies and what it does is it funds white people the money never goes to Black America so billions billions of dollars raised to Black lives matter not a single black school bill it's not a single black building built up not a black neighborhood that was built up but many more black people arrested and sent to prison in these riots more black people died in these black lives matter riots but at least the white people felt good when they gave the dollar to Black lives matter so it's a political scam", "VlXEOsP-BvU": "all right hello hello hello hello this is actually I think the first time I've ever done live on YouTube which is pretty crazy because I always brag about having started my career on YouTube and I haven't been back in a while but I wanted to start doing a lot of these videos because we were back into election cycle and when I first thought into doing YouTube videos it was because we were in the midst of an election cycle and I felt that there were so many narratives that were being tossed around that were impacting black people and specifically actually quite ironically when I started my youtube career one of the first videos that went viral was of me attacking the black lives matter narrative about police brutality and what I called it at that time as an election strategy that was actually the notorious video that I did at UCLA that Kanye's attention and he he shared it or tweeted me or whatever it was and I went viral in the more cultural space so it was a really crazy year for me although my interest has always been in about realizing how race is something that has become an election strategy for the left so you will notice that there is never more racial unrest never more racial topics trending than just before an election cycle and I said that it happens every four years every single like it's right on time you could almost set an alarm for how on-time it is for the need to start drumming up the race narrative right so let's just talk about what has been trending in the last week right I mean we can even do the last 48 hours because this is how obsessed right now the American mainstream media is with starting a race war okay let's start with like topics right today Jimmy Fallon was trending under the hashtag Jimmy Fallon is over party you guys may have caught that hashtag on Twitter and when I look to see what this hashtag was about I thought maybe Jimmy Fallon had done something or said something silly on his late-night talk show and he needed to apologize for a note it turns out that Jimmy Fallon it was trending under cancel Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Fallon is over party because somebody dug up a video from 20 years ago in which he dresses up I believe as Chris Rock on Saturday Night Live and he therefore painted his face of darker color and they said this is an example of Jimmy Fallon doing blackface he is a racist now and he should be canceled this was trending okay out of nowhere 20 year old video first and foremost this video wasn't something he was trying to hide obviously he was in a Saturday Night Live skit the year 2000 is when it was shot which means that when Jimmy Fallon shot this video and came out on Saturday Night Live people laughed nobody he thought it was a racist thing people thought it was funny this is why it caused no outrage in the year 2000 but fast forward to 2020 election cycle fast forward to 2020 the year when we can no longer take a joke where we try to find every single excuse to be offended when I say we I'm not talking about just black people I'm talking about women I'm talking about men I've met people of all races that are actually waking up looking for reasons to be offended it makes it makes no sense why are we trying to be offended and why are we having to get into time machines and travel back to the year 2000 are there not enough things for you to pretend to be offended about in this year okay portly ridiculous anybody trying to suggest that Jimmy Fallon had had bad intent or trying to be a bad guy oh well you shouldn't have done it you know they're just old to be this even this black face to me has taken off in the last couple of years okay I remember when megyn kelly got fired for saying truthfully that when she was a kid people used to dress up and as long as they were actually trying to be the characters that they dressed up as and they were painting their faces in that color it was considered okay I remember the same thing when I was a kid if kids if a girl wanted to be Pocahontas and tried to make her skin darker to have long pigtails people did that and nobody thought this was this big thing of kids trying to be racist on Halloween Day but again our culture has been growing increasingly more offended which is bizarre you know the less and less our society becomes racist the more and more over these last 60 years people are now being offended in seeing race issues everywhere so that was trending number one then we had the incident where Lana Del Rey was training those who don't know who Lana Del Rey is she is a musical artist who had a smash first album she's saying at Kanye and Kim's wedding and she's been putting out new music and apparently in some of the music that she's been putting out Femi not feminazis all the women that freak out about feminist issues are angry with her because she portrays you know her relationship in a way that they say sends the women who's moving back 20 years and so she in us in a statement said you know you guys say I send the women's women back to a year for talking about my relationships that I have and then and getting pet people like Beyonce Nicki Minaj who you know will put their bodies on the internet and gun number one hit oh but she accidentally picked people of the wrong color when she said this Beyonce Nicki Minaj it was black so she began trending people want Lana Del Rey to be canceled because somehow she was attacking black women and so she's a racist to throw her in the Jimmy Fallon pilot pile she needs to be canceled that's just in the last 48 hours in terms of pump what has been trending now let's go to the bigger media topics which everybody cannot get enough of an election cycle black people dying why people being upset black people being videotaped in any uncomfortable situation with the white person whether it's in a dog park in Central Park like this woman who has just lost her job and her dog in a span of 24 hours because she went trending or whether it's an issue of police brutality I will be forthcoming with you and tell you that I have not I know very little about this situation of the guy that happened today apparently dying under a police who was apparently strangling him I think the video starts when the police officer is already on top of him you guys already know I'm too intelligent for me to judge something by seeing half the video I have no idea why the police were there I don't know what the sky resisting arrest I'm not going to issue a verdict like the rest of people that are reactive and emotional because they cannot wait 24 hours to just get all of the information before you make a scene yet so we have that going on which is obviously just following the the case of the heart artery which happened a couple weeks ago and then we've got the guy in Central Park who's filming a woman who did threaten her dog all right he told you exactly we have the park I am getting this information from him his Facebook page okay Christian Cooper's Facebook page about Amy Cooper where he describes exactly what happened he saw a dog okay playing in the park without a leash on and this woman with a mask on and he was upset because the dog was playing in the plantings like there was grass and flowers that were planted nicely in this area of the park and the dogs messing it up and I was a bird watcher he got upset he walked over to her and he told her that her dog was not supposed to be in this region of the park and to which she said you know my dog all the dog runs are shut down as you guys know New York City is still under lockdown so basically there are tons of areas that you can't go into and he told her well you can take your dog to this area in the ramble or whatever he said and she did not take her dog to the area she had not have her dog on leash and he pointed to the sign where she was supposed to have her dog on the leash they obviously weren't getting along at which point he said to her okay if you're gonna do what you want to do and I'm gonna do it I'm what I want to do and you're not gonna like what I'm going to do ominous an ominous statement any person that is being legitimate and being honest in assessing the situation knows that if you were a dog owner and somebody said you're not gonna like what I'm about to do and then proceeded to as he did call her dog over to him by his own admission okay and then reaches into his pocket she freaked out I would have thought he was trying to take my dog in New York City there's a ton of crazy people anybody tells you you're not gonna like what I'm about to do and then calls my dog who's off of a leash on him I would thought he was gonna steal it I don't know what she thought but she instantly said don't touch my effing dog went to grab it at which point he then whips out his phone and starts reporting in my opinion he wanted attention plain and simple escalated the situation by saying something I think she obviously could have just the dog on the leash but she wasn't doing it which made her akarin him even over over over there telling her your dog was included to be here he's a region that your gums booth to be in this area he's a Karen and you got to Karen's in the park a situation that escalated beyond what needed to be and her phone call which he said an African American man is threatening me and that's where the internet exploded and called her a racist and demanded that because she was holding her dog simply by the collar clearly trying to get control of it because she thought this dude was gonna do something to her job now they have her out to be an animal abuser and all these crazy things in her whole life is ruined because it happened during an election cycle and people are bored at home and Florentines and it just cannot be realistic about the fact that this is a mundane stupid park scenario and have never needed to be taking this far or escalated to this point but what are you going to do everybody needs pretend to be upset about something at all times okay so let's just talk about like black lives matter all right let's talk about the race narrative anybody think it's weird that after Trump won in 2016 before he won every single day black lives matter on CNN talking about black issues all of these videos that were on the on Facebook being mind like we're seeing right now of instances with black people with white people only it's like you know there's never any other issue they want to show you you'll never see black on black stuff you'll never see white on white stuff it is specifically white on black stuff that has showed perpetuated every single day in the media in 2016 until Trump on the election and then it was just like disbarred right then the media was obsessed with just getting Trump out of office every single day there on him they're trying to impeach him they're trying to say that their media that it was have to rush inclusion none of the airwaves none of the media was dedicated to what was going on in black America or black deaths because we were no longer needed okay just let's just poverty we were no longer needed the reason why this narrative is drummed up every four years is because the most important vote to sustain the Democrat Party is the black votes the best way to get black Americans to vote mindlessly for Democrats is to continually tell them that they are being oppressed by racist rich white people and a systemic and systemic oppression okay and then getting a bunch of Democrat candidates up there like puppets like we're seeing right now camel hairs all of them jumping in there saying this is horrendous Camilla Harris suddenly cares about black lives let's talk about her record in terms of locking up black men probably killed more of them in prison but apparently she's at the forefront and talking about these horrible things that black America is going through but where was she on all of these issues in the last three and a half years at Trump's been in office everyone just went away nobody cared about all of these glass issues you want to do a test to really understand how ridiculous the media narrative about and I am gonna answer some of your questions ready go online to any any site like I actually just did this on Daily Mail go just read the headlines and you are going to see that the only time race is actually brought up on the headlines is when it has to do with a white person doing something to a black person so the headlines will literally read white cop kills black man right then you go to the headline below and it'll say woman killed by her husband right and you look and you look at the pictures and you go to the articles to black people right man shocked in in alleyway right and no race man should you look and it's a it's a black man that shot a white man right never mention race they will never literally I want you to go do this experiment right now when you get off of this actually go look okay and see how the headlines are portrayed they will never ever ever mention race in the headline unless it is specifically something that has to do in a black with a black person who is being allegedly victimized by a white person right that is how you know the media is trying to control and drop a race for Lana Del Ray actually said in her comeback today when she didn't when she did a video disputing all the absurd things longer races she said people are dead seriously trying to inspire a race war and that's what they're trying to do right so you got people like me who catch heat because I don't jump into it right I will not be valuable I'm not going to be a slave to a media narrative I'm not going to go every three years when the media pretends to care about black people so we're running around emotionally and issuing statements about how horrendous something was and say oh that somehow makes me a real black person because I stood up for justice and then we're dead quiet when there's tons of actual horrible things going on within our own community we're dead quiet when this stuff is going on but it's not an election cycle nobody says anything nobody pursues these stats these stories nothing okay so I'm calling out this fake stuff from black America white America the media nobody cares at all unless we are in the midst of an election cycle and that is just the truth I had somebody said to me and say oh Candace you know give me one example of you ever about a time and a black person was a victim actually I did that literally last year when I spoke about an issue that nobody wanted to talk about which was that nine year old boy Tasha Tyshawn Lee from Chicago who was literally in a basketball court doing app after school couldn't have been more innocent did nothing wrong as lured down an alleyway by another black man of course his wife is never is never a big deal nobody cared no black lives matter there's no marching his black lives don't matter whenever there ended by other black people right and he got shot in the head and killed point-blank because the men who killed him wanted to get even with his uncle or his father over a crime at that issue was something that literally broke my heart when I read it I typically don't speak about most cases but that case I'm sitting here this is an innocent child victim and nobody cared you want to know why because it didn't happen an election year and it didn't happen at you know by a white person right so we're not supposed to care you you think that black people that don't instantly respond to snippets and clips on the media do so because they don't do so because they're not black right that's that's the narrative that's out there maybe they don't do so because we're smart right maybe it's just because we're intelligent enough that we have a high enough emotional IQ to know when someone's trying to manipulate our emotions to get a reaction from us to make something viral right to deliver a point that people can stump on our issues just what happens every four years let me answer some of these um chats guys this you know I'm I'm really really new to this so I do not know how to do this but okay I see um to Shana learner I hope I'm saying that right channel learner or Shana learner thank you for the super chat to John Nolan thank you for the super chat to ransomware thank you for the super chat and for saying kennesaw uh for a question or from greatness eighty one if a Democrats lose twenty percent of the black vote they're finished I believe they will lose more than twenty percent this election cycle I I think that they're definitely are losing the black vote they definitely not going to win and the margins that they won in in 2016 and a fatal loss would be just five points so if the Democrats opposed you that don't know dip below eighty five percent in terms of the black vote their party is finished so it is very very serious for them it's the reason that they're importing so many illegals across the border because they're trying to turn illegals into the next permanent underclass it's the reason why they stopped really hard after Trump won on illegal immigrants and the border issues all those things because to them it is never about caring about the people at the border or caring about black people being shot it is always about looking at a voter market and trying to do something trying to get people to believe that you're their Super Heroes so great comment I totally agree with that um how can I schedule an interview with you you have to just email my website thank you guys you guys anybody have any questions I'm there's probably a place I could literally go to for that but I don't know where to go through 20 minutes ago before your livestream we are at some bricks I just want to say thank you for the super chat Candis when you're done running for office how about you come to Canada and run again we'd love to have you here thank you the thing I'm saying as far away from Justin Trudeau as possible you guys got bigger fish to fry Candice thank you for being a warrior for the truth having the fight back against social media shadow bending when all you're trying to do is tell the truth so as you guys know I think that the only way we're going to win against the social media Giants is for us to start actually suing them Congress needs to push through legislation to start looking at these people as either you know they try to be publishers they say they're just utilities but they're acting like publishers if they are utilities every single person should have the right to be on their platforms Verizon can't say because you're a conservative they're not allowed to send through phone calls and so I'm personally right now pursuing Facebook I know that crater view is pursuing Google and I think there are a few people that are taking on Twitter but I think it's going to take time but it's gonna happen through the court system according to my brother-in-law I only support you because you're a race traitor how do I respond to that I would respond by telling your brother that he is definitely a racist if you think that a black person having a different opinion is an example of them betraying their race and you're a white American then you think that you know how all a lot of people think which would make you a racist I disagree with all different kinds of black people I disagree people in some people in my family room some people in my family on various topics topics and issues we have a debate because we're all we all challenge other to think we don't think alike we support different candidates I would say now my family is much more on the conservative leaning side altogether just because they've seen me go through what I've gone through in the press and the absurd things that the press will do and try to caricature certain people you know and pretend like there's some right way to be black I mean we've even seen it with conservatives we've seen it with black conservatives recently who are now trying to say oh I'm seeing a real black conservative because I'm even out here arguing for a Matar like just because a bunch of people do something and really active and stupid and emotional does not mean that I am now required to be reactive in stupid and emotional I have a higher emotional IQ than a lot of people and I first of all ask questions and ask why why why is the media spinning this web why are you trying to get me to react and why are you doing it so aggressively so I just want to put that out there because I know a lot of people were asking me questions about what I think about what this person who thinks or what that person thinks or why disagree with that person they are different people they are entitled to their thoughts and their ideas I liberals can't bully me conservatives can't bully me I have my own mind there's a difference between a leader and a follower so I don't look to see how many people agree with me in order to say my opinion or trying to create little cliques with people that agree with me to show that somehow I'm right I think that's that's the sign of weakness and I would say that um gosh there's a book here how do I get to this ah Candice farmer for Senate thank you Thank You Debra migliori thank you ransomware Thank You jfp 85 Nathaniel Charles Thank You Beth well you said what is your perspective on movies and shows which portray racial tension like scandal or the American Sun I think in general what we're seeing is that the media does not just mean the news it also means Netflix it means a documentary set you remember in 2016 it was all about the Central Park five and all that full narrative because they were running on the fact that you know Trump didn't support the chance Center for five and two thousand had so then next thing you know and we've got million dollar production dedicated to the Central Park five this game is this game of the media being controlled and manipulated emotions a lot deeper than you think when it comes down to is simple brainwash right you see something enough times you accept that to be reality even if it's not a reality it is not a reality on that black Americans are being you know gunned down or in situations where police are overly aggressive and more than white people are expanding people you can look at the numbers yourself there they just aren't there it happens more often to white people and to Hispanic people by rate but we don't know any of their names I think that that's incredible think about the fact that you can name so many black Americans who were killed at the hands of police officers off the top of your head right Trayvon Martin Mara or I guess you could count just because of the he was a former police officer if you wanted to and you can go on and on and on falando castile you can't do the same thing but somebody asks you to name white men that were killed by police officers or Hispanic men that were killed by police officers because the media doesn't care about those stories because they don't feed into the leftist media beast and it's it's sad that people can't pick up on it that people don't see that black America hasn't figured out that what they're really doing is setting us up for failure right there is no other community no other community even when horrific things happen right that do the amount of protesting and screaming and getting ourselves arrested and and and and yelling and hollering that black America does let me give you an example so recently this year there's been a major increase in black Americans murdering Jewish Jewish Americans especially in the cities it was it's been a major issue you guys might recall the the rabbi who was stabbed in the head he was actually at a service and a black man who was disturbed came in and stabbed and killed him he just stabbed him in the head you may be recall rabbis getting together and hold any vigil for this death you do not recall any boycotting protesting any Jewish Black Panthers if they exist marching through the streets demanding justice you do not recall that back to back madness and that coverage why is that why why is it only luck American does that Hispanic Americans if they die and and the killing is unjust why do you not see that portrayed in the media or see Hispanic Americans gathering and doing that thing what is it about black Americans that we do that if you're going to say it's it's you know it's our history or history in this country you know there's been tons of discrimination in this country none of us have looked through it so please don't give me the BS and and all of this stuff about pretending oh it's you know slavery and and the Jim Crow laws and all the stuff it is truth is people that live through that didn't act like this didn't the rioting started after the civil rights bill of 1964 the riots it happened across the cities have started happening after we actually gained our freedom in a legislative piece when Jim Crow laws were put to an end some black people started rioting right so why is it that free black people in this country are more riotous and more angry right than the black people that were actually living under systemic oppressions I can't understand that I can't wrap my head around it why do we need to pretend that we are living in the 1850s and why is that a token somehow a token of our blackness right the angrier you are shows that you're black no it doesn't I don't subscribe to black militancy I wouldn't if I lived back in the day of Jim Crow laws and unrest I would have been a Martin Luther King black I just don't believe in it I don't buy into it I don't see how it helps advance any causes I don't see how not being able to intellectualize something but demanding us then be tried in the media makes us look better or helps to you know make issues better I just none of it it seems good for the future for the present and does it has no justice for the past so that's your ex fear longwood an answer for why I think that they put things on the media let's see I have blacks don't get the real news they are run by race hustlers and so-called leaders which is 100% true you will find that when these stories are perpetuated it's always the same suspects I was glad to see finally that guy Shawn who's lost him I can't even think I'm at the moment trending on Twitter as people are realizing that every time there's a death he fundraises and nobody knows where the money goes fun does campaigns for Marberry fund raises for every black person that he says dies unjustly and he's probably scammed millions of dollars from black America and he's gotten away with it right meanwhile if I give somebody an opinion that's different and goes against the brain which I always have anything that goes against the grain because I think against the green they'll be like you're grifting is for money what money am i earning by having a different pick when I send a tweet of my opinion about the Amato Armory case right how am i gaining any money did I put together a fund raiser and say support me because I have this position up no I don't do that that's actually people on the left that do that they fundraise off of these issues okay I'm giving you my opinion because I don't think that there is a way forward for black America unless we pause and we start thinking and we stop becoming the most reactive race in America okay we are behind and lagging behind every race in every statistical category and let me not even say race because I'm it's not just being black that makes you laugh right because Nigerian Americans are ahead of black Americans they come to this country from Africa Caribbean Americans are a head of a matter of black Americans you can get to this country so all of this is the s about its we can't get ahead because systemic oppressions you're gonna have to explain why when black immigrants come to this country they're able to get ahead of black Americans it is our culture I genuinely believe that we have a rotten culture I've been doing a ton of reading lately obviously because I've been in quarantine and you know something I read a quote from Confucius about how if you want to see like I'm summarizing here but if you want to see the heart of a civilization listening to its music right and it sort of woke me up to the fact that everything I black America has become is because of life as it has a black culture this culture that we've cultivated and we call it being black when in fact it was created by what people for it was created by racist white people right we can throw on a track and listen to something about baby mamas and broken homes and how many homes somebody has that wasn't created by black people that was off the music that we were creating that that wasn't Motown right we used to be about family together that broken-down family that you're seeing that's portrayed in the airwaves now that's coming from Jim that's coming from the legislation that was pushed through him in 1960s that broke down the black family right and then suddenly they broke down the family they removed the father's from the home right via the Great Society Act and now they tell us that that's ours right so if you if you don't celebrate that we should be celebrating that's just who we are speaking it down in in broken language right now a lot of people will say like Ebonics they're teaching in class is that this is black culture exist how we speak it's just how we communicate for another no no no no that it's not how we communicate for another who made you think that not speaking proper English was how we communicate with one another even that all of us are in the late 1960s again with the black Wheeless in Seattle people changing their names back to their African names developing their own slang and their own talk I was studying David Hume you guys don't know him he's but you know one of the greatest Scottish writers philosophers and David Hume is the Scottish people were severely behind the English people just in terms of everything and David Hume inspired and uplifted and challenged the Scottish burr by saying if we want to get ahead we have to learn English so he turned around to to the Scottish tribes and said we need to learn English me to master the English language and they did that and in a matter of years a matter of decades the Scottish people passed the English people in engineering and in the sciences and it's because they challenge themselves to be better not to be worse I didn't pretend that somehow having a broken language having broken down families was a symbol of who we are and that is so unique to black America I don't subscribe to it if that people say that's so that's how you have to be black that's have to be but listen to your psychologically it could be black you can't speak in proper English or you're acting white right to be black you instantly have to jump up like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] trained chimpanzee excuse my language like that like a trained chimpanzee every single time the media runs a story and act angry and riot and talk about how pained you were to see this happening to black people but keep your mouth shut right when it happens black on black because if you talk about the black on black crime you're a race traitor right to be black you need to celebrate LeBron James you've got to say that you want to be a football star right Laura James the greatest right when you see someone like dr. ben Carson dr. Condoleezza Rice you call that person a [\u00a0__\u00a0] because they betrayed you you wanna know why because they're talking about economics they've graduated and they like tons of degrees they they're not being black enough don't listen I'm listening the bran James he throws in a beta cap and tells you that we're literally being hunted down right because because he's not educated right celebrate that that's our hero he represents us that is what being black is in 2020 that is what we are told that being black must be in 2020 and we are then routinely told that we should be ashamed if we don't subscribe to that I do not subscribe to that okay I don't subscribe to that my family's subscribe to that the children that I will have one day will not subscribe to that okay that is not an example of black brightness on example of American greatness it's an example of a broken culture that has been fostered by people that were racist in the 1960s and is being perpetuated now by people that are race hustlers in 2020 okay and that is the media as the black people that stand there and take the bait every single time if I could attack other black people that don't I will not subscribe to that I know brandon teena doesn't subscribe to that I know Kings face doesn't subscribe to that we are looking to uplift our community okay talk about real as you talk about books let's put together a book club okay let's all go say we're gonna go read a Thomas old novel a Thomas old book on economics and talk about what we learned about what happened when the government started giving us assistance and programs dating all the way back to the FDR and the Great Depression let's talk about real stuff okay oh no let's not talk about that it's not being black I'm not going on a rant right now but genuinely everybody is making me sick everybody is making me sick I'm both sides of the aisle everybody is making me sick because nobody pauses to think everybody wants to call somebody bought and people nobody pauses to use their brain cells anymore to talk about why it is this just appears every four years after a couple more questions that I'm gonna wrap this because I'm reading reading a book right now and tell how to back into that cuz I'm a little bit of a nerd these days you ain't black if you don't vote for crazy old Joe yes I know somebody sings is like CIA stuff social program is discussing yeah I mean definitely and we know there have been tons of programs put in the past that have done things Roger Harrison thank you so much for the super chat Patrick be thank you so much for the super chat I appreciate all of you guys supporting me and and the things I have to say what did you think about what Leo said about you he lost me I don't guys for any person that does a video about me I will tell you across the board the answer will be the same first and foremost I don't watch them I might catch one of someone send it to me but the second thing is like anybody trying to build a career by being the anti canvas ACL like this one just thing as an anti career like if we could just make a platform just saying I'm going to make a bunch of videos talking about how much I hate someone and become famous I would have been the anti Beyonce because I would be a billionaire today I'd be like I'm gonna be anti Beyonce no I'm gonna be aligned with you talk about how much I hate everything Beyonce says and does and make a lot of money because I'm anybody there's no such thing right there's no anti Beyonce so anti Kanye Kanye is gonna be coming up you understand me be honest no matter how much you take that okay Candace is going to be Candace no matter how much you hate her you might get a couple of clicks being the anti Candace but you're not gonna sustain your career so why don't you go find talk about what you care about and the things that you believe in not the people that you don't so that is across the board every person that you think you saw something about me I don't care literally literally I don't lose a seat over it doesn't anything I mean I'm where I am because I don't spend time on stuff like that okay god bless you've got the good work thank you so much Christina for the super chat I think it's super chat not all heroes wear capes thank you very much thoughts on Twitter fact-checking Trump's tweets about Mill and voting I actually didn't see that but Malin voting is fraud I've been calling out for the last couple of months that's the obvious play of the coronavirus let's talk about why we subscribe to Netflix but we can't subscribe to ourselves and our communities for the same price but listen it it could be a conversation about you know internal black bloc issues I think I'm going to wrap this unless I can figure out how to do these super chat things cannot but I promise you guys I will try to figure it out for not for next time thank you guys so much for listening I'm sorry that I ranted about how angry I am by about just an area that's been going around but just keep a look out for it don't let the media divide us you know sad things happen all the time I mean there's a quarter a million of people accordingly people every single year are killed in medical errors it's a horrible tragedy every time it happens but we don't racialize those things we don't say let's boycott all doctors you know we look at those as tragedies as human errors and we don't allow that to divide us so I think in any instances where you think any person no matter what race they are didn't deserve to die keep your hand about it look at things objectively and say is this a whole picture or is this one instance and usually you will find that you are looking at a rare instance another thing that happens every single day thank you guys lastly - MJ a2 873 thanks for super check your way knit things go super chat everybody have a great night", "HoZcVDrVU94": "how do you talk to your significant other if you find out they've been cheating on you my recommendation is you don't i have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to cheating i just think it is the most disrespectful thing that anyone can ever do it takes five seconds to send a text and say sorry i don't want to be in this relationship and i think that the hurt that people put one another through because of a moment where they just refuse to do that and don't want to have that tough conversation is just so disrespectful i think if they couldn't honor you with the respect of at least breaking up with you then you certainly don't have to honor them with the with a conversation i had that happen to me once when i was in high school and i am not kidding he was my full fledged boyfriend i didn't even pick up the phone didn't speak to that

was talking about just this week on my show was that my first introduction to abortion is actually with people and my cousin who became pregnant people in my family pardoned two cousins who became pregnant both of them were peer pressured to get abortions this this whole depiction in the media like women are marching into these clinics and they're super happy and it's my body and my choice it's a lie i know six women that have gotten abortions each one of them were pressured whether it was by family members whether it was from boyfriends i know one where the man became literally domestically violent and said you are going to abort this child and not ready to have a kid this is the conversation that america is not having the majority of women are getting abortions under duress so far be it

man not on instagram i am not being funny when i say that i'm always very suspect when guys are very into social media everything that's on the internet is almost like soft porn it's actually something that i've talked about with my husband and it's not good if guys are constantly looking at i guess advertisements for different women and i think it's the reason why we have men in the past that seem to be so focused on their families and men today who kind of feel like oh well look tinder i can just swipe to the left or i can buy a different brand as if they're shopping for cars um in different makes in different years so i think that depending on a how religious you are you can definitely meet a good person in church but in any sort of conservative institution you know i know people that like to go to political events tend to find others that are drawn by the same interest and they find that oh hey we have the same thoughts and ideas by going to a conference or something

making when you're actually getting prepared to give birth like it became super surreal to hear them saying it's not a life it's not a life and at that moment i think what it really demonstrated was that in america we're not debating abortion we've never been debating abortion when it first got started we were debating eugenicism because margaret sanger was a eugenicist and you can look plenty into her history there's no doubt that what they really set out to do at planned parenthood was to get rid of the undesirables in society but now we've kind of fast forwarded and we're talking about child sacrifice and it's really interesting because when i talk to my husband about this it's very because obviously he's english um but when we have when we have these discussions he's so shocked at american women right these women that are screaming outside of the supreme courthouse and they're pregnant and they say still not a baby i feel my child kicking every second of the day right it's

because you hate the president so much it's gonna stick around okay if you ever in a mil anyone in a million years have imagined that one day in america they would be telling us when we can go to school when we can open our business what we can tweet what we can put on facebook what opinions we're allowed to share um when we have to mask our our children this is crazy this is a communist country set up and now to add to all of it we now have an election that goes on for weeks which literally only happens in socialist countries right when they rig it for hugo chavez and venezuela they stop counting votes then suddenly they say they magically found all the votes and now he's gonna be um your duly elected uh president of venezuela when they rig it for vladimir putin you would imagine

hydroxychloroquinite i treat it treated a patient it worked they remove it and they do it all for the same reason safety right safety is the reason that they're removing the opinions of doctors who are actually seeing patients and telling you that something is not right about this cobia 19 narrative for our safety they're shutting down our business for our safety um they are are making our children not go to school and only learn virtually and hold the tablet all day it's all for safety not fear-mongering not for government control it's for safety that they've impoverished millions of

right because you actually thought coven 19 was going to wipe out the entire population well wake up because you're about to realize what it's like under a socialist regime i when i was censored and this is how this lawsuit started and by the way make sure you share this video go to the website www.factchecksuck.com you can read about the dhaka you can read about the lawsuit we filed what happened when i decided to launch this website was that during covet 19 i shared um the opinion of an actual doctor who wrote an article talking about the harms of lockdown and talking about how the death counts weren't making sense this was an actual doctor okay and facebook not only censored my page and removed the post they wrote an article and they decided that it was not true because they had found another doctor who disagreed so basically facebook sent to me because their doctor was better than mine when i looked into who these fact checkers were i was astonished to find leadstories.com an official facebook fact checker was actually a company that was created in 2016 by a man named alan duke a single man named alan duke right who is alan duke allen duke is a former editor of cnn of 26 years so in 2016 when donald trump wins he leaves sanded and he starts an official fact-checking firm um and facebook grants him the business somehow the license a brand new business says you're gonna be the official fact checker these fact checkers have made themselves the supreme court no one can dispute them except they're not following the constitution it's just a complete banana republic they decide they don't want to hear your opinion and you're censored if you could say right now on facebook an actual experience you can say i was standing in line and someone snatched my ballot and stole it from me and if you wrote your true story they would fact check you and they'd say untrue and that the election um you know it has election integrity they are fact checking your experiences your opinions um and these people are obviously not official fact checkers not a lot elected happen to be an official fact checker right we haven't elected you we have no idea who you are you worked for cnn for 26 years you're an activist alan duke so i turned to my husband obviously at the time i was five months pregnant i'm eight months pregnant now i'm just about to be eight months pregnant rather um and i said we can't sit back and do nothing about this because everyone is complaining and no one's doing anything and we need to launch a massive lawsuit i am and i want the best lawyers um lawyers that i can't really afford um but it's okay because i trusted that we would be able to crowd raise and fundraise this um so we have spent about up to this point over

to think about it it causes you to have self-doubt within yourself and then it causes your brain not to work so you're not even thinking of ways to create new solutions because you're like well what's the point because I can't do it anyway so you're not even gonna be willing to try the message of plexi it could change that because it's important it's that I can attitude is that no excuses attitude is to go hard it's the real American vibe it's like what what America doesn't want to work hard you know get a beautiful home you know be healthy have beautiful kids you got the dog the picket fence like you want all that beautiful stuff you want to be able to travel that's the American dream and that comes from working hard and you can see that when it comes to plexi everybody's working hard and that's the message that US has that American people should take like let's work hard let's have no excuses no matter what let's not quit let's not stop let's keep going and that's the American

[\u00a0__\u00a0] in a week that it appears that celebrities are competing for the award of most despicable yeah i raped you but did i mention i'm gay attention-seeking chelsea handler made a late bid for the superlative on sunday night 28 people dead and counting in san antonio texas victims names not even released yet and chelsea handler issued the following tweet innocent people go to church on sunday to honor their god and while doing so gets shot and killed what country america why republicans i try not to name call but it takes a special kind of looney tune to blame 62 million americans for domestic terrorism and people claim republicans try to politicize events because they rush to blame isis an actual terror group flashback i would probably move to canada i have a house in spain so i might move there first but canada i that's the best option because canadian like canadians are so underrated the whole country of canada is underrated so we should all probably be living there anyway canadian pollock seems like they have that right act together he seems like a really young first of all he's good looking and he's young so he's learning right i mean his father has a lot of experience so i'm sure it's a family thing it's not like our bush family thing it seems like a much more kind of progressive cooler family thing the trudeau family in canada chelsea you are a complete and utter waste of a u.s citizenship and i will personally fundraise a first class ticket for you to go live in canada you know nothing about politics in fact you don't even know anything about comedy anymore which is why netflix canceled your series we get it you're bored your new gig is twitter you spent all your time criticizing donald trump in 140 characters or less you have claimed that he is personally responsible for dividing up this nation which is why it makes perfect sense that you would blame republicans for a mass shooting hey has-been handler are you aware that texas is a red state are you aware that you essentially just blamed victims for their own deaths are you aware about those victims husbands wives children and the family that they left behind will have to read your tweets and claims that it's their fault that their loved ones are dead those are rhetorical questions chels no one will be holding out for your response because your career is over i suggest you age gracefully maybe that means deactivating your account or making friends with other crazies like keith olbermann and fading into obscurity like the rest of the democratic party the rest of us americans are going to stick together for anybody watching that sees a tragedy like this and thinks it's grounds to denounce this country kindly leave in fact i'd like to recommend an edits to the diversity program why don't we rehome anti-american americans why don't we swap them for people that actually have enough respect to stand for this flag to respect this country and to stand behind our president thank you so much for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "c2Pob4LvHJk": "ladies and gentlemen please give a warm welcome to the founder of organization black guns mater and moss to Ray [Music] we're gonna make it nice and awkward we're gonna make it nice at awkward sup you hope ain't none of y'all streaming this to the gram oh good how many Democrats we got in here no so jobs gonna make it awkward ain't nothing here what is one identify yourself okay now look this R is gonna get awkward is that a man or I'm not being funny cuz I can't see that far is that assistant that's a woman okay that's our sister too okay so I got 15 minutes and his 15 minutes the best way for me to help is to engage in dealing with three basic concepts empathy facts and solutions all right now we all agree that we in the middle of a war okay whether that's spiritual whether that's political whether that's whatever a war of hearts and minds right now just like I sister over there she's outnumbered in this room by a small margin right but with that being the case on the outside of this room even though we're the silent majority mass media some of them are here now are gonna paint a picture that we're the minority with that being a case you have to have all of you have been pushing for the things that you're about about freethought about solutions about all those different things you're struggling with certain things especially my white people that's down with blacks it you're struggling with it because you want to say the things that the black people is saying but you're going to get painted this race is about some of them saying cameras right no different than the mellah native beings in here notice I said Mel innate beings okay dumela native beings in here that are communicating about the things that are about liberty free thought and things of that nature you're gonna get painted somebody say your name but they're gonna call you BAM off top bed winch tap-dancing they don't say that to me cuz I'm strapped most of the time so they know better than that okay so the best way for me to hit one of the ways is you can be armed that's just my thing with that being the case the best way for me to help you all because every single person in here has struggled with this and you have to reach the reason why the people are brothers and sisters right are still in that same thought process it's because that same media has made it very adversarial so I cannot help you I'm around the country doing this work I'm in liberal cities talking about arming black people people get their heads blown off for doing what I do okay so I've had some success cuz I haven't got my head blown off yet alright and somebody coming with me when they try okay now with that being a case it's just made it awkward everybody got scared where's that being the case the best way for me to help y'all it's for you to ask questions I got a couple of minutes and I'll answer them based on my experience anybody can jump in you can ask a question but I need two at a time we got to move quick I cannot serve you if I don't know how to help you so when I say this if nobody ever wants to go first so whoever wants to go first no wait where's the sister that's the Democrat what are you a question what are you feeling right now I want to ask you that question first okay speak up stand up unless you want to tag somebody in the act and respond for you now wait real quick this is a no pun intended this is a safe space we are all agreeing that we are going to respect our sister correct the tolerant right okay go ahead my sister mm-hmm so y'all heard what she said I'm gonna say it again she said that basically what she's recognizing is regardless of the rhetoric that's it that's the arm that's a media term by the way right regardless of the rhetoric on the blacks its side on the left whatever we all pretty much want to defend basic freedoms commonality will television tell you that no why not there is energy resources money and power and division in chaos okay this is not the Tower of Babel this is actually communication they want you babbling not talking over each other not to each other that's why I start these type of state these you know speeches finding out who is the quote-unquote other our sister dear she's not really the other she's not a day the people that we're trying to engage are not a day either the bishop just burnt it down by breaking down we are all Americans okay melon ate it and now I'm melon ate it don't care so that's the first thing now who got the question yeah brother right here just speak up man come on what's up Chandler yeah yeah yeah excellent question so basically excellent question Chandler so basically how do you get because the schools are cesspools of leftist propaganda be very clear about that okay how do we get especially in a younger group how do we get an understanding of having young people engaged in the Second Amendment you know you I don't use the word gun very few people even see me with a firearm I allegedly have a whole bunch of them okay when we started black guns matter our whole goal and approach was the conversation is about conflict resolution safety de-escalation and the Second Amendment defending the right when my gay friends that are very liberal I say man if you knew somebody in a pulse nightclub would you want that person to have an option to defend their life it's not adversarial it's a simple question the major part of that is again that first one empathy on three saying I want you to say it with me one two three the people that you're talking to don't agree with you right now because they have not read the same books write it down it's really good okay so Chandler in that space the first thing that you got to do recognize that empathy then explain this this is about a right if you do not want to have the right to defend yourself you don't have to and i'll champion your right to stay on the left right with that being the case you do that from a place of infant empathy then the second one is data or facts the fact of the matter is over 90% of the mass shootings that we see even though they make up less than 1% of shootings in the nation because those cameras say us oh you go outside you're gonna get shot even though they make up less than 1% ninety percent of them are in gun-free zones empathy facts next question I'm gonna make it nice and boring - I have - I couldn't match the bishops energy go ahead brother yeah uh-huh yeah yeah yeah okay excellent question so I do a bunch of different things in that regard so his question is okay what does every rap song say a magazine is clip that's wrong it's wrong okay now you know the intent of the person that's saying it people used to say yo what's up my [\u00a0__\u00a0] to me all the time and I used to go yo I'm not a [\u00a0__\u00a0] after I you know I mean however the intent cuz when I started creating that adversarial I know what he means but I don't want to be offended by the word or triggered so I say I'm not a [\u00a0__\u00a0] as opposed to going this brother does not understand cuz we haven't read the same books it's the same thing with the nomenclature around firearms understand if they say a clip they bro you mean magazine right and a light-hearted way the left media has a PhD in PR they are better at it than us so you have to adapt I know what he means and I have to educate you have to do that every single time you are charged now with this Fight Club you and my Fight Club your homework assignment is every time someone says what's up my [\u00a0__\u00a0] what's up my cracker what's up my [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm using all of the derogatory to him so I leave anybody out okay I understand what is their intent and if there's a way to bridge that gap there you explain we're there nomenclature is not incorrect but I know what you mean but here's an add-on that's empathy then you hit them with the facts that creates the third thing which is the solution does that make sense and the other thing is you got to know your nomenclature if you think 1911 is embedded in Glocks then you probably already out of the game the gun people gonna laugh you're right there oh there's sister got in front of you brother I got you next guy's sister she's running for Congress thank you for your service uh-huh real woman Carrie uh-huh yeah mm-hmm yes you can you shoot him in the face I agree her question in essence is how do we get women to understand now they'll be very clear the people that are getting a little squeamish I am not advocating for any unnecessary violence be very clear about that I deal with conflict resolution and de-escalation however if a woman is attempted to be raped by a scumbag shoot them in the face that goes back to this brothers question here and I got shoot brother I don't forget about shooting I got you that goes back to that statement again empathy man I understand that you have the right is your body your choice do you want to put if that's your languaging do you want to protect your body do you think a man a violent man has the right to just rape you or your daughter would you want your daughter or your sister or your mother or your grandmother to have the means to defend herself non-adversarial empathy it's the second one facts third one solution brother right there sub Jonathon word outstanding brother [Applause] mmm-hmm owners yeah so I'll tell you what I did black doesn't matter started we was going through one event it was going into 2015 going into 2016 elections and you know how I go every especially the presidential elections register to vote register to vote register to vote I live in Philly I just got my butt kicked running for City Council I learned a lot but I still took that Eldo okay so they said next time so what they say is Philly's 80% Democrat okay what they'll do is they'll say voters register you register to vote register to vote vegetative oh I got you now during that time we was like yo we don't need a registration to vote drive we didn't license to carry Drive so what I did was I started getting all of the paperwork I printed them out and I just started handing them out to people and showing them how to actually fill out to get the license to carry right now when you take those people and you get them they license to carry you show them the paperwork all that now they have an interest once they have that interest and then you show them and again I have plenty of friends and family that are us on the Left like our sister there right we have so much in common but when you start showing them you're enjoying this thing shooting sports for recreation whatever as well as to defend against tyranny on top of again the rapist can get shot in the face when you start showing that there are democratic policies racist policies of gun control specifically designed to dr m-- black people primarily when you show them that after they've got an interest for this thing they'll start voting a different way then you create a voting block off of that okay but the first step get the paperwork know it like the back of your hand front and back handed to people the people that don't want one and say no I don't want one cool I respect your right to not have a firearm empathy facts solution what was the brother over here somewhere brother back there okay that was all Candice bro they don't messenger so I was I came to the back bro so I'm just joking I'm just joking I'm respecting the rules so here's the thing I'm personally a libertarian okay now again that's not knocking again it's different free thought with that be in the case when I go into my anti-gun friends homes that are afraid of firearms I don't take a firearm I make a joke I say yo bro if I die if I get killed in your house i'ma kill you right I believe in a free market I believe that this space right is allowed to create the rules that they were I could choose to not come or I can choose to go I thought being here with you tonight you all was important enough to come unarmed that's it respect freedom respect liberty who else I'm gonna do a couple more my sama I got rare thanks for what you do thank you we understand what the civil rights was all about yeah how would you answer how the silver rights has been hijacked and how it's being used today yeah oh absolutely so for one they do things like the question was you gotta hear the mic so y'all heard that one again PR some people think PR means like public relations I have a different definition of it I got you it's perception and reality write that down I'm giving y'all jewels for the low with that being a case perception and reality they do a very good job of hijacking a thing the arno a classical liberals about they would they was the shooters they was like no forget the crown we doing this American thing that's it they're very good at changing definitions so what you have to do is give the fact of the matter do you know you got to go back right so the civil rights moving in that regard we have to co-opt it there's a way to say black people no different than my Jewish homies right there's a way to say that we have had a unique scenario in America that does not knock anybody else it's just the facts okay what happens is the people that want to dilute that they have to add everything else into it they have you you're almost to say I have black white Spanish Asian whatever type of friends and say yo unfortunately black people kind of like we're indoor the Mafia the transatlantic slave trade that is not a knock to my Jewish friends this ain't like the pain Olympics but yeah I'm saying the the Holocaust was better than the African Holika it's not what it is it's recognizing what those horrible things was were so we don't repeat them and recognizing how they hijack things and do that that way how you beat it is the same three-step approach you go I understand that you have had my Irish friends say it all the time oh the Irish were immigrants right bro but you came here willingly it's a fact of the matter now some people were here they came before Columbus look it up I have in Vance tsardom oh just a quick drop with this being a case you have to make sure that you're fundamentally sound and your knowledge and approach to it while making sure that you're empathetic for other people struggles we have to recondition the world and to stop thinking that people on the right black white whatever do not have empathy or care for the other side especially as a gun owner they tell me I'm just down with death it's wrong okay it's just the right here how much time I got left I have no idea 15 minutes that it's no way I got that much tumblr gonna my name is Davis Jackson and I'm gonna remember but what I'm concerned about is children getting guns I mean yeah they see their parents they have their guns they take them to school they get kicked out of school and then at least leads to the school to Prison Pipeline you must do something about that there's so many teens now they're in jail I have a solution yeah I want to hear the solution check it all around the country be sure and then and then the gray market of how they get these guns so wait so here some of that is just falsehoods again and I'm listening camera people I'm not picking on y'all cuz I'm pointing you to people with the cameras okay media paints it as if one there's so much death one is enough for me now let me be very clear I don't believe in accidents when it comes to firearms it's called negligent negligence okay when you get a firearm which is your human right as stated in the Second Amendment that Bill of Rights right it's a trifecta Declaration of Independence Constitution Bill of Rights it's the trifecta they go together it's a pyramid okay that Bill of Rights is a list of things enumerated that the government does not give you the government does not grant you the right to defend yourself the government does not grant you the right to express yourself first one I get the freedom of speech I get to say what I said second one is if y'all trip and I get to defend what I just said with a gun okay now those are human rights civil rights kinda but more human rights okay civil rights are given by government that's why every couple of years every couple of decades black people in America they got to re-up on your Voting Rights fact with empathy don't be mad at me okay now with this being the case since this is a human right with those rights come responsibilities my position is if you are a firearm owner and you are negligent with properly storing your firearm I want you to go all the way to jail do not pass go do not collect $200 okay because every time that negligence happens media makes it look like all gun owners in the room are just the most horrible people you know why most young people this is gonna be very gruesome you know how most babies shoot themselves with firearms and where they shoot themselves in the face do you know why because their little hands their fingers aren't long enough to do it this way so they turn the gun around so their thumbs can grab it and they shoot themselves in the face if you allow your child my child anybody's child because of your negligence I want you to have your due process then I want you to go under the jail okay and doing things like that and making sure that we're educating people about the responsibility is spider-man with great rights powers comes great responsibility is the same thing so by educating people if anybody want any information on that black guns matters the name of the organization right here and I I know I probably got like to set right wrap-ups time to go go ahead take this last one I'm out you gotta make it quick outstanding huh huh you know who John Henry Clark is anybody here know who John Henry Clark is that's your homework is something I'm gonna tell you to quote but I might answer your question I know what you like good don't finish no no bro they lying bro they lying bro I'm listening good all right so wait so wait something cuz I got a wrap-up how do you tell liberals some are ignorant some are deliberately no you say I respect your right to not have a firearm your choices do not determine mine simple I'm out my name is Marcia ray I took too much of your time please [Applause]", "7e4Adeg1l7I": "okay instagram i wanted to do this video and to comment on this back forth exchange that's happening publicly between kim and kanye not because i'm interested in celebrity feuds or divorces but because i think this is actually a topic that's really important for all parents to be discussing as we kind of get into this new age of digital media and social media and children having access to things that we didn't have access to when we were kids i'm 32 years old we did not have access to tick tock and twitter and facebook and any other social media app when i was young and this is a very important topic so to give you guys a background if you're not following it uh kanye has been very very vocal for a long time before the divorce about wanting his kids to be kids when they grow up meaning he was very against north his daughter she's eight years old and even in years prior she was wearing makeup and wearing lipstick and he was very against that he's been vocal about the fact that he doesn't want his child on social media um so this is not a new thing that's happening because they're getting divorced it's just coming to a head because they're getting divorced and kim obviously has a different perspective on it because she was okay with her wearing makeup and she's okay with her daughter having social media kim's daughter is north um we know of north and we know all of their kids because they have been on you know reality tv their entire lives and north is for the record eight years old um so this is something that parents all around the world should be aware of it is not an assumption it is a reality brigham young university actually did a study last year to show that children that are introduced to social media have a propensity higher rates of suicide and propensity toward suicide adults included obviously we understand that social media has depressive effects and it's basically allowing you a window to look into the lives of people and to have this perception that their life is better than yours so it's basically you just stacking up and going oh i wish i had that life oh i wish i had that life i wish i had that husband that body that face and it causes depression and if you're an adult you might be able to deal with that depression but for young kids it's a lot i don't know why it took a study confirming it from brigham university to confirm that social media is harmful for children um when really this is common sense we're seeing things that we've never seen before we're seeing people that are 12 and 13 wanting to get their lips injected to want to get to want to get boobs to want to get butt implants to want to do all of these things extraordinarily especially for children and when i look at these people that are so young and they're getting these implants i'm thinking to myself when i was this age i wasn't even thinking about how i looked i mean eight years old before i even had braces i mean to put that into perspective we're talking about third graders third graders this is not you're not even interested in guys you really just want to color with your friends i think i was in spice world at that time listening to spice girls wanting to dance with friends and have sleepovers so we're not talking about someone that's even on the brink of maturity we're talking about an extremely young child who's extremely vulnerable who should not have the access who should not have access to the internet and have five million followers as she has which is already to me something that is harmful why are there five million people in the world that want to follow the every action of my child i i choose not to put my kid on the internet at all because i want my child to be able to have that choice and i want my child to also be able to make that choice when their brain is developed something that's extremely problematic here and why i wanted to speak out is because you know kim's response to this obviously kanye posted this publicly and he has made several pleas about just keeping his kids off social media and i'm not claiming to know the ins and the outs of their relationship but something that was extremely problematic is that kim in her response writes that he's controlling this is him being controlling and obsessive and sort of all of these buzzwords that women use when they want to make themselves look like they're being victimized by a man and she specifically says that you know north needs this as a you know a creative outlet and kind of suggests that you know the divorce has already been traumatic enough for them and you know giving this child tick tock well you know somehow helps to to alleviate some of the traumas that they may be experiencing as a completely unacceptable excuse your child does not need social media to deal with any traumas you know you have a child that's stuck between two billionaires tons of people have gone through divorces come from divorced families i'm one of them um this is not something that is necessary to heal from a divorce whatsoever in fact i would almost argue the exact opposite and it's super unfair because in this particular regard actually kanye is doing the right thing he's protecting his child from the public i think part of this is that obviously kim is kim kardashian so she's lived her entire life publicly you know she takes a stab at kanye for talking about this publicly when in reality she has welcomed all of the world into every aspect of her lives for years so this is just a victim claim pretending that you care that there's a public discussion about this when we've watched your family members pull their babies out of their vaginas on tv doesn't make sense pretending that you want to protect your children when they've been you know on on a show which sure you had editing control over but you know that doesn't really make sense to suddenly pretend that it's kanye that's harming them by bringing this discussion to the forefront especially because it's a very important discussion we're talking about right now there was a case an 11 year old girl you can look it up she killed herself and she her mother is now suing the last name is rodriguez i can't think of her first name her mother is now suing facebook and snapchat saying that they know how harmful that this you know that the effects of and the addiction that comes from their their um comes from their products is and yet they allow children access to it and so this mother is currently engaged in a lawsuit with both snapchat and face and facebook my personal opinion it's the mom's fault you know and and you have decided to give your child this weapon you know this weapon is you know you're shocked when your kid becomes addicted to this and becomes depressive and unfortunately for a kid they don't have yet within them they don't possess the mechanism that it is to compromise so everything feels much larger when you're a kid right think about your first breakup whatever it was i don't know how old you were when you had your first breakup um but i think i was 13 it was like one of those like fake relationships but you know you think it's the end of the world everything becomes a suicide thing when you know you have a fallout with a friend you think it's the end of the world kids feel in a way that is so much bigger and grander than adults do and when you apply social media to that you know they're not able to deal with a hurtful comment i know that came as suspended comments on this but you know they're not able to deal with even a hurtful idea thinking that this person is prettier than them or more mature than them or wondering if guys like this better they're not able to put that into the proper perspective because they have brains that are not developed and kanye in this regard and again this is not supposed this isn't to say everything he's ever done has been amazing and everything kim's on has been bad but i think that kim you know kind of represents someone that is very pro social media it's how she made her you know how she made her brands how she's made her living by giving more and more and more and more of herself and unfortunately she's not able to see the harmful effects of that she's not able to assess her own addiction and her own obsession with social media i mean to me you're talking about two billionaires you've got if north needs a creative outlet from her divorce kim could go buy her a ranch in wyoming literally tomorrow and say here's a whole ranch she could she could afford to bring pablo picasso back from the dead and say here paint with my daughter i mean she's got that much money she could she could buy her whatever she wants as a creative outlet she could buy her a plane and fly her to france um and you know have her dying amongst the stars this is not an average family that has to deal with sadness or has to find a creative outlet in a tricky spot because they don't have resources it is pointedly ridiculous to suggest that this is the only creative outlet that makes your child happy and quite frankly it doesn't matter if you make your child if it makes your child happy you are the adult for that reason there's a lot of stupid things that kids want that they believe make themselves happy we are arriving more and more in a society where people don't know what it means to be an adult right they don't know they're they're constantly caving to what their kids want well this is what my kid wanted my kid just wanted social media so like i gave them because they like it and it makes them happy i don't care if it's giving them temporary happiness if you know that in the long run it's going to cause pain there it's going to cause addiction so you have that addiction you know how addicting social media is because you have that addiction um and so i just feel like kanye deserves to be defended in this one in this particular regard because any man who understands even how they use social media how men look at social media the fact that there's five million strangers how are you to know that amongst them are not pedophiles there's been you know pedophile networks that have been established on tick tock of people that are looking at kids why would you want your eight-year-old on to be observed on an app you know every second of their day this is different from you know moms that have social media and post their kids you know once in a blue moon when you are allowing your child to have social media you have no idea you know who you know who is looking at your kid and that is remarkably unfair to then castigate your your significant other or former significant other and pretend that this is an obsession it should be an obsession protecting your children and protecting our children should be an obsession so if kanye is obsessed with getting your daughter off social media then may i suggest that you develop that obsession like may i suggest that you develop wanting to protect your child from the world wanting your kid to grow up wanting your kid to be a normal third grader who wants to plan sleepovers with her girlfriends who wants to you know have do an art project i think for me i was wanting to do gymnastics and you know and jumping around like there are other creative outlets and if you are a parent and you really care about your child no matter what your child is going through you would want to protect them from the net you just you would 100 so we're speaking to a larger problem right now and i think this is like as i said like i don't think the kardashians are aware of their own addiction and obsession with social media so they would not recognize those symptoms in someone else they would they don't see any harm in it because they've made a living and again that's not to take a shot at kim i've met her she's very kind and she's very nice but you know social media is her life that's the point like she's she's a nice person but social media is her life and she's not seeing clear on this so just standing up for dads that kind of get caught like i just don't like the idea of the victim mentality of a woman saying oh he's obsessed and he's controlling and you know sure he may be obsessive and controlling about different aspects but on this particular one kanye west is 100 right and kim is in the wrong get that child off social media she's a child she's eight years old you know that it leads to an increase in suicide rates amongst kids these are devastating effects there are multiple stories out there of parents saying shoulda woulda coulda i wish i did not allow my eight-year-old to develop this addiction you know don't be that that parent that finds out too late because you don't know kim there was no social media when you were a kid you were allowed to be a kid you were allowed to be grubby you're allowed to have braces you were allowed to look weird and not develop that that sense of like being self-conscious about yourself because you're suddenly able to see all of these other kids and see what they look like you don't know that so right now what you're doing is you're experimenting with north you're experimenting with her you're experimenting with her psychology you're experimenting um and assuming that it's going to be okay i wouldn't let my child be the test on me for social media in this age and i don't think she should either so just throwing a little support toward kanye thanks guys for watching", "-1ZhMvGaacI": "if you are not educated about something you shouldn't speak on it i try to do very good about that if i don't know something i try to listen i think for lebron would you rather be quiet though i would rather yeah i would rather him be quiet than tell his people that follow him a lie yeah 100 is better to be quiet than because i think it's a lie right that but that's what i'm saying so i think for him he needs to do the work of actually becoming educated about these issues and it's not hard it really isn't hard to actually look up data and to look up the facts i mean with a man with his kind of money he doesn't even really have to look up that in fact someone could send him a short list of the bullet points and say hey here's what's actually going on in american society but um yeah i think so lebron james frustrates me because he has such a big platform and he has the power to do so much good i always say he's just he's not a kobe i don't know i'm not explaining i love i absolutely loved kobe and i think kobe was extremely educated and he just wasn't someone that the media could play but kobe didn't voice his opinion as much as lebron there might be a reason for that yeah", "80TBtJTehbI": "my question for you is just more so some advice when your family and friends have totally different viewpoints than you are not even really opening to hearing your viewpoints like how do you deal with that make new friends because that's optional uh seriously it's just it's not life is too short you know and i'm not saying that your job shouldn't be people are are sometimes just not ready to hear information and um i've realized that even with family members that's a little more permanent right you're having family members that disagree with you you wouldn't even i even told you the stories of what i went through coming out as a conservative on a public stage um when my family was so tied and boggled down and the majority of my family was liberal at that time things have changed they just weren't ready to hear the message but then eventually the message comes to them in the form of their surroundings wokeness is such a disease and it spreads so rapidly that eventually if you just hold on to truth your friendships and those relationships will come back every single one of those people that's the beauty about being on the side of the truth", "U9-4_rMK0vo": "it became very apparent and evident to the left that what an easy way to realize there were real racial hurts um rightfully so people that lived in the time that my grandfather laid but what if you could just mind that pain forever right and keep saying to black america look you're still not doing well in society and so it's because of white people and of course it's so much easier to say yes i it's white people it's not because of me it's not because of things that i have done it's because of this other thing that i can blame perpetually for the rest of my life i have an excuse the left has understood how desperately as human beings we want an excuse for everything because personal responsibility is hard right it was hard for me to become personally responsible to look myself in the mirror and say hey guess what no matter what's happened to you even if you weren't dealt a great hand in life i certainly wasn't i didn't come from any money i didn't my parents are not together but to look myself in the mirror and say candace you know what no matter what doesn't matter what happened this is all going to be on you that's a tremendous step for anybody to take and yet i was fortunate because my grandfather never took the victim mentality if i asked my granddad this is a true story um just a couple of years before he died at before his memory was going he was sort of the strange thing about when when people go through dementia is that their recent memories go but they dive back into the past really easily you know he could just jump to being 14 13 12 and and tell you a story as if it happened yesterday and he would talk about you know i say granddad you know tell me tell me about this time you know the ku klux klan and uh spraying bullets in your home at night and he'd say yeah well they didn't like my daddy they didn't like my daddy and i'd say what was that like he's all we would we could we kids we run to the back of the house and we would hide under the bed and then i'm not even kidding you a smirk what came across my grandfather's face and he said and my daddy grab the shotgun and shoot back at them boys proud proud as anything boys diminished them just completely like the smallest little thing a clan member nothing my daddy like it was fun like you know i mean like you know the way he said it made it sound she just he just had so much pride and i thought to myself wow imagine seeing yourself as so little as a victim that's such a terrifying memory me listening to it second hand terrorizes me brings pride to your brings pride to you it brings pride to your face brings a smile across your face all of these years later um and i would see these see this in my grandfather growing up and i wanted that sort of strength without even acknowledging it as a little girl he was quietly seating my brain with understanding that he just never took the victim mentality never once ever did my grandfather while we were growing up ever say anything bad about white people it just wasn't a thing it wasn't a thing in our household in fact if you would ask him about those times and granddad you know tell us about you know when when segregation was happening in north carolina you know he would just say oh baby it was a different time and he would say you don't listen to any excuses my grandfather just didn't believe um in this idea that we are all determined by our past and that's why he got ahead that's why when my grandfather died that sharecropping farm that he worked on he became the owner of he died he built his retirement home on the sharecropping farm right and so what excuse did i have how could i look at myself right when the kind when the time came even though i tried it in college i experimented with it of course liberalism yeah everybody sucks because you're white because you're man you know i mean um it's the reason i can't get ahead you know it's very fun to experiment with for a few months but it's not going to help you get ahead in life and and having that my grandfather uh be that person that so imbibed that into my into my mind changed my perspective on the world and it made it so easy for me to understand um what the left's game is today why they don't want to see this why they don't want to see a room filled with white people and black people coming together to hear a positive message right because at the end of the day what they lose is power if i can make you jump because i say to you well you know this person's racist and you oh my god i'm terrified so i can control your actions i can say the way that you're going to defeat racism is you're going to vote for this guy right oh the this guy he is sexist hates women right here front row seat found him here's what you gotta do to defeat him you just gotta give me five dollars five dollars donate to my campaign and i will make this horribly bad sexist guy the front row go away this is the game they're playing right it all it does is it gives them power while the rest of us are are feeling in pain and going oh my gosh it's so hard we're never gonna get over this they don't ever want you to get over it look at how rich and powerful they've become especially when you look at government oh my gosh how government has grown itself the war on poverty the war on poverty trillions and trillions of dollars you've got to help black people the war on poverty began what was it in in the mid 60s we spent trillions of dollars since then and black people are poorer today per household than they were then right anybody want to check in on the war on drugs what do you think the number one killer in killer is in america you think cobit's killing people why don't you go check the statistics how people are dying of fentanyl and you know who doesn't care to talk about the government because what's it creating a bunch of addicts and it's not just a fentanyl it's government dependency the worst addicts that there ever are are people that are dependent on the government to provide solutions in their households and so i say the experiment was on black america they realized of course lyndon baines johnson was a tremendous racist on record use the n-word all the time it fascinates me that in the school system you are taught that he is a hero to black america because he inked the civil rights bill in 1964. he inked it with a figurative gun to his head right the protests are breaking out and there's a quote that they have from him saying that you know we've got to give these n-words a little bit of something to make them think they're getting ahead right but he says i'll have those n-words voting democrats for the next 200 years and boy did he mean it right right after the civil rights bill they said oh well we're going to help you we're going to help you guys with welfare we owe you something for all of this time you guys your families are together but let us help you a little more the government will give you money if if you agree that men shouldn't be we'll give you more money if the men that got you pregnant or not in the household de-incentivized marriage right breakdown of the family what do you think all this gender nonsense is about the breakdown of the family the biggest the biggest um enemy of the government is a family a nuclear family that is intact dad telling the children what to think dad and mom raising their children up with good values me my granddad's lesson my grandma's lesson a family that is intact around the table right that is an enemy of the government and they will attack it from every angle and by god they are they are going after it viagender l-b-g-t-q-i-a-r-f-b-c-d right just tacking on more letters encouraging children now you know once you say before okay this person's gay this person's lesbian now they want children in the classroom to be thinking about gender what i was learning my colors right i was learning how to spell i have no idea anything about my children about my teachers personal lives when i was that young but they want it it's an easy way for them to destroy the nuclear family what else are they doing you think oh what's up with the climate change nonsense terrifying children that they're going to die you want to know what that's all about the same thing the breakdown of the family they are telling children it would be irresponsible for them to have children because the planet's going to be dead in 10 years they gave an award to prince harry and meghan markle for agreeing to only have two kids because they didn't want to impact the planet any further to burden the planet any further this is nihilistic thinking it's counter to family what do you think this whole you know what abortion now nine months in the womb go for it it is it is all about the breakdown of family it is the machiavellian scheme of the government is to confuse people to make people angry but most importantly to break down to make sure there is no chance that in the future children will have a productive productive family right start young raise them up young in the same way that my grandfather planted those seeds and at the end even though i went a very liberal route back to conservatism i came back to the beginning because i realized something was working in that household [Applause] so guys i only have one minute left on stage and i could talk your entire ear off but if there's one thing that i want you guys to walk away with it is that understanding that when the media is showing you something and you feel something no matter what that is if you're feeling rage if you're feeling inclined to suddenly donate money to or do this or that pause and ask yourself who benefits from this emotion that i am experiencing right and you will find it's never you and it's never your household it is always a government whether it's a government here whether it is a government over there foreign affairs it is always a method to make you believe that government must be grown now we need a department of racism and education and diversity and inclusion now we need a department that's dedicated to this and that government is growing and the family unit is shrinking we can easily fix that we can easily fix that we just need mothers and fathers alike to recognize that we are in control of our households these are our children and that this should always represent the red line", "d29lBUtbvK0": "all right guys Society used to be so good because TV shows used to be fun and stupid yeah stupid but at least they weren't woke they were just fun so today I'm going to review some old MTV shows that you probably forgot existed with that you really liked when you were younger okay first up is date my mom time to date these mothers and find me and love it this was really more like you know it should have been called betrothed they say opposites attract and your daughter's Wild Side would be a perfect fit for the square guy Ida I would like to date your daughter no the dating show sent singles on dates with three moms who tried to convince them to pick their son or their daughter but I honestly think that parents would do a better job if we had parents picking who their son and daughters would date relationships would last longer because Society has since become So Vain meet my crazy daughter Alex [Music] and at least we supported parents being in control of their children's lives which brings me to the next show parental control do you remember that one you would have a girl that was to interview five boys and after about five questions for each of them and some sort of an activity her father would eliminate one of the contestants I'd say I'd party a little bit too much do you have to party well yeah a little disappointed at that answer yes men and control their household old you can date my daughter you cannot date my daughter no more Tinder this is pre-tender when the world made sense when your dad had a shotgun on his lap and told men to get out of here scram adios loser okay this next one pun intended I loved this one next you guys totally remember this it was a person that went on a bunch of blind dates with possibly up to five other single people who were known as the dater and then there was the next bus from the Big Bus the added twist was that the date could end at any time they would be like next in the middle of a date well do you smoke yeah I actually do I have to say next next is basically Tinder that was the pre-kosher Tinder just being able to shout next the middle of a date was the original swipe left or swipe right careful what you do because you may be next up true life I remember this one this one was really good and it was shocking it was jarring what happens if you're one true love is also a member of your family it doesn't say anything in the Bible cousins should not be together it was back when the world we thought the world was normal like it sort of felt pre-social media and we assumed that everyone was normal and just growing up and then we found out that there were random kids that were eating wall paint and it was scary like oh my God what's wrong with this person and true like I like wall paint see how it turns into like little flakes pop it in I did like the series I watched it every single time but in retrospect that is when things began to unravel in our society next show this one cracks me up so much Pimp My Ride [Music] somebody who had a really junky car that was barely working and they get picked for Pimp My Ride and then exhibit would take him into the shop and they would take take the car and make it all cool you know I remember watching it being like whoa wow there's an air fryer in the backseat he's like now when you get in your car you can also fry you some wings your own mobile Afghan machine [Music] but like as somebody who is an adult with two children what are you gonna do with that like we don't need a hot dog maker in the trunk we don't need an air fryer we hooked you up with the real deal right out of this exhaust oh my God damn I've never seen an exhaust do that like I feel like it was cool to watch and we were addicted to it because we were children and didn't realize how completely and utterly impractical and practical these cars were that were being built and in reality what they should have done is just offered to pay for the car that's the most gas money especially now how about I'm just gonna pay for your gas I'd be like whoa I'll keep my junkie Toyota because I just want you to pay for gas foreign next up boiling point [Music] this one was my favorite still is I think they should bring it back there was nothing wrong with boiling point it was really funny it probably get scary actually today people are under a lot of pressure but I do think that this show was brilliant she's been set up on a date from Hell he's sitting on Buried Treasure I'll split the profit with you split your head get away from me and they're being taken for a ride essentially you know how it worked that you would win a hundred dollars if you could just stay cool you didn't know they were hitting cameras and someone would do something ridiculous and if you didn't fly into a rage you would get a hundred dollars for staying cool for like one minute or three minutes the boiling point would be how much time that they wanted you to stay cool for before you would randomly as an unsuspecting stranger receive a hundred dollars and in this certain episode there was a cake that people were coming in to actually pick up their real cakes and the boiling point team would intentionally cut one slice out of the cake so they come out with the cake and be like okay check your cake and pay us and they'd open the cake and they'd see like a slice missing on their son's birthday cake and people would be like um excuse me there's a slice and they'd be like oh yeah you know we baked the cake we took a piece we were hungry it's not a big deal have a happy birthday and these people had to stay calm and just stay calm and shockingly people would stay calm like they'd be like oh like no like I'm gonna need that full cake you know not me I could never win an episode boiling point I think I would just be like are you kidding me I need the cake actually maybe I could sometimes I just a lot of times tend to see the humor in certain situations so I'd probably just be like that's not gonna work boiling point was an excellent show all of these shows were so excellent bring back fun stupid TV and stop with the woke stuff I

worked his entire life to give us a better opportunity growing up in his household for the formative years of my life and he put god first his wife second or first you could say that they were tied although he probably would tell you he was a democrat um he's a conservative those are conservative values if you believe in god if you believe in honoring your wife if you believe in structure that those are conservative principles today so it made sense having having been raised in his household that i would come out the way that i did um you know he ended his life he when him and my grandmother retired back down south he actually purchased the sharecropping farm that he started his life on and and now owns it and that really is the american dream the idea that you can start anywhere in your life and end up somewhere else as long as you're willing to work hard and not play the victim so my grandfather is the ultimate non-victim so my mentality is very much like his and i

know people succeed in many ways we charlie and i firmly believe that the left has tried to create the idea that the government is god in america and exactly right it's the deification of the state

individual to make choices and then you get rid of the church you get rid of private philanthropy you get rid of charity and then you get rid of the moral order and code people will still have that

okay because you know that was a long couple of years if you guys call in me a a race trader because i refused to be an idiot and i was obviously recognizing the scam that was black lives matter i was obviously able to discern that they were using the faces of dead black people to get you guys to run around act like fools get your sons and daughters arrested in protests wearing signs painting streets blm blm not realizing this is free marketing this is how marketing works in business everybody ran around to be a billboard for black lives matter they got white people you owe me an apology too white liberals running around with their guilt opening their wallets bending down to black lives matter and nobody asked the question about where all the money was going if you guys did not recognize that it was a corporate scam how do you think they got the nba on board so quickly the nfl on board so quickly how do you think they were they managed to transform america so quickly with politicians demanding that there was black lives matter squares and black lives matter signs i mean you were looking at a business that was being built very quickly around a suspicious time election time when the riots seem to keep happening black lives matter they were telling you covet didn't matter protesting was more important anybody with common sense knew that this was a money laundering operation anybody with common sense knew that black lives matter was raising money for something other than black people you're looking around there was no headquarters there was no intent to say they were going to build a school that they were going to give out scholarships to black people there was nothing that was done other than demanding your allegiance and some of you guys a lot of you guys got on board and got angry at candice owens and other people too who were telling you that this was a scam you called me so many racist names and said that i betrayed my race when in reality you were betraying your intelligence you were too emotional to see what was obvious and right in front of you so now the narrative's cracking patrice colors got three million dollars in homes separately these other three people they bought is just now a six million dollar house that's nine million dollars there was some house that was announced in canada that she bought for her girlfriend okay that's totally around let's call that 12 million dollars here's the here's the best part you're not done finding out this is this is this is nothing okay black lives matter announced that they raised over 90 million dollars okay they were funded they were bust all of this stuff was paid for by white democratic operatives right where's the rest of the money they're getting you focused to look at the three black people but those people are at the bottom of the organization okay these people were just dogs that were willing to portray their race were willing to let black people get arrested were willing to allow you know black americans to riot in the streets for these young kids to get records they didn't care right those were just your average day hustlers these three women right these three black women were just your your regular day of scam artists right like that's just the stuff that you see how do you guys recognize scam artists they're at the bottom who's at the top that's the question you should be asking yourself it's not going to be a black person it's going to be white people right because it's only white people oh it could only be a white person that is sitting at the top when you looked at who was pouring cash initially into black lives matter right i kept telling you it was using black faces as a front and they were raising a bunch of money it's going to be a white person right they said they raised over 90 million dollars so far we've accounted about 10 11 maybe 12 million dollars that has been scammed from you guys where's the rest of the money okay ask yourself that question start maybe it's time to look into all of the charities that said that they were backing black lives matter and they were lying saying that they were 501c3 they were never a charity black lives matter global network was never a charity but you had what was it called thousand currents which had some old school clinton operatives that were running it and i was telling you guys that this was a scam and that it was political and that nobody that was sitting on a stage screaming about black lives cared about black lives whatsoever now you attacked me i want my apology so i'm saying that's so i'm going to say here is you owe me an apology and i'm going to get it and by the way i'm going to forgive you because i'm a good person right i'm a good person he was like oh candice i don't like the way you say it even if you're saying the truth i don't like the way you say it well do you like the way you got scammed did you like the way you got scammed was that better to hear the lie that made you feel better did you did you like the scam you got hustled admit it you you didn't know what you were talking about didn't understand the game of politics and you got hustled all of you maybe it's time now to check all of those celebrities those oh i'm with black people celebrities oh i'm with them oh so i'm going to tell them i support black lives matter maybe it's time to go to them and ask them why they refuse to air the truth because they knew okay these people were in my dms all your favorite rappers basketball players were in my dm saying yeah we know about something's weird here but if i say anything i'll get attacked all of this crap they didn't have the nerve to tell you what they knew was painfully true maybe it's time to check your idols now right all of those hip-hop artists and rappers and the people that you listen to who told you to follow this scam to the end maybe it's time to check yourself and realize that you're following a bunch of people who lie to you all the time your life is not getting any better because you're following lies maybe it's time to stop attacking black conservatives who have been trying to inform you on this there might be something that we know i wrote a whole chapter on the scam that is black lives matter in my book but i'm a race trader right i'm a race trader okay well this race trader wants her apology so drop it in the comments i'm gonna forgive you i'm a good person i'm a christian woman i'm gonna forgive you but i want my apology thank you black america okay so this is insane in real time right now i am watching uh patrice colors do a live claiming that i went to her property and demanded to speak to her um and she's i i only can describe it as she sounds like she's really scared um we're working on a documentary talking about all the funding pertaining to black lives matter obviously we know that patrice and a lot of the founders purchased million dollars hope million dollar homes in white neighborhoods uh they also purchased a black lives matter property so we went to the property and asked if there was anyone that we could speak to very politely by the way we've got cameras in tow so there's no way she can live it's all on camera and we just said there's anyone we can speak to nobody asked us to leave um the person went inside it was just a white man that we saw outside that was providing security which is super interesting because obviously patrice here is anti-police and so she's oh my god i think she's crying on this live pretending that she was harassed we like i said very politely to the guys or anyone we can speak to my name's candace owens we never went over the gate it was just me ringing a doorbell trying to speak to someone he said absolutely nothing he started just recording us and we said okay if there's no one we can speak to we're going to leave patrice is pretending to be scared because she knows that this black lives matter lie is falling apart um and she doesn't know what to do i mean people are aware of the scam that is black lives matter she's intentionally limited the comments so you can't even comment on this post because i was going to comment and be like this is a complete lie and we have it all on camera in terms of what happened so what you are seeing right now is the face of a woman who is pretending she's afraid of right-wing pundits when in reality she's being exposed as a fraud who took millions use the faces of black people took millions of dollars to fund herself to fund her lifestyle to fund her girlfriend and to buy million dollar mansions in neighborhoods where no black people live so patrice um this footage that we the story that we're covering is just a significant one i have always been interested in the fraud that is black lives matter your fake tears your crocodile tears about someone politely ringing your gate and speaking to your white security guard and asking if there was anyone that i could talk to because i was covering the story um not really going to cut it patrice this is only going to commit me further to discovering the truth about what you have done with this funding black people died you use their faces to raise money you demanded that the policing be stopped you demanded that police officers be defunded but you've got a private security detail outside of million dollar homes it just doesn't work this way sweetheart so um the truth i'll set you free or can this one shall set you free girl because i'm about to tell the truth all right we're still filming bye okay instagram i wanted to do this video and to comment on this back forth exchange that's happening publicly between kim and kanye not because i'm interested in celebrity feuds or divorces but because i think this is actually a topic that's really important for all parents to be discussing as we kind of get into this new age of digital media and social media and children having access to things that we didn't have access to when we were kids i'm 32 years old we did not have access to tick tock and twitter and facebook and any other social media app when i was young and this is a very important topic so to give you guys a background if you're not following it uh kanye has been very very vocal for a long time you know before the divorce about wanting his kids to be kids when they grow up meaning he was very against north his daughter she's eight years old and even in years prior she was wearing makeup and wearing lipstick and he was very against that he's been vocal about the fact that he doesn't want his child on social media um so this is not a new thing that's happening because they're getting divorced it's just coming to a head because they're getting divorced and kim obviously has a different perspective on it because she was okay with her wearing makeup and she's okay with her daughter having social media kim's daughter is north um we know of north and we know all of their kids because they have been on you know reality tv their entire lives and north is for the record eight years old um so this is something that parents all around the world should be aware of it is not an assumption it is a reality brigham young university actually did a study last year to show that children that are introduced to social media have a propensity higher rates of suicide and propensity toward suicide adults included obviously we understand that social media has depressive effects and it's basically allowing you a window to look into the lives of people and to have this perception that their life is better than yours so it's basically you just stacking up and going oh i wish i had that life oh i wish i had that life i wish i had that husband that body that face and it causes depression and if you're an adult you might be able to deal with that depression but for young kids it's a lot i don't know why it took a study confirming it from brigham university to confirm that social media is harmful for children um when really this is common sense we're seeing things that we've never seen before we're seeing people that are 12 and 13 wanting to get their lips injected to want to get to want to get boobs to want to get butt implants to want to do all of these things extraordinarily especially for children and when i look at these people that are so young and they're getting these implants i'm thinking to myself when i was this age i wasn't even thinking about how i looked i mean eight years old before i even had braces i mean to put that into perspective we're talking about third graders third graders this is not you're not even interested in guys you really just want to color with your friends i think i was in spice world at that time listening to spice girls wanting to dance with friends and have sleepovers so we're not talking about someone that's even on the brink of maturity we're talking about an extremely young child who's extremely vulnerable who should not have the accent who should not have access to the internet and have five million followers as she has which is already to me something that is harmful why are there 5 million people in the world that want to follow the every action of my child i i choose not to put my kid on the internet at all because i want my child to be able to have that choice and i want my child to also be able to make that choice when their brain is developed something that's extremely problematic here and why i wanted to speak out is because you know kim's response to this obviously kanye posted this publicly and he has made several pleas about just keeping his kids off social media and i'm not claiming to know the ins and the outs of their relationship but something that was extremely problematic is that kim in her response writes that he's controlling this is him being controlling and obsessive and sort of all of these buzzwords that women use when they want to make themselves look like they're being victimized by a man and she specifically says that you know north needs this as a you know a creative outlet and kind of suggests that you know the divorce has already been traumatic enough for them and you know giving this child tick tock well you know somehow helps to to uh alleviate some of the traumas that they may be experiencing uh that's a completely unacceptable excuse your child does not need social media to deal with any traumas you know you have a child that's stuck between two billionaires tons of people have gone through divorces come from divorced families i'm one of them um this is not something that is necessary to heal from a divorce whatsoever in fact i would almost argue the exact opposite and it's super unfair because in this particular regard actually kanye is doing the right thing he's protecting his child from the public i think part of this is that obviously kim is kim kardashian so she's lived her entire life publicly you know she takes a stab at kanye for talking about this publicly when in reality she has welcomed all of the world into every aspect of her lives for years so this is just a victim claim pretending that you care that there's a public discussion about this when we've watched your family members pull their babies out of their vaginas on tv doesn't make sense pretending that you want to protect your children when they've been you know on on a show which sure you had editing control over but you know that doesn't really make sense to suddenly pretend that it's kanye that's harming them by bringing this discussion to the forefront especially because it's a very important discussion we're talking about right now there's a case an 11 year old girl you can look it up she killed herself and she her mother is now suing the last name is rodriguez i can't think of her first name uh her mother is now suing facebook and snapchat saying that they know how harmful that this you know that the effects of and the addiction that comes from their their um comes from their products is and yet they allow children access to it and so this mother is currently engaged in a lawsuit with both snapchat and face and facebook my personal opinion it's the mom's fault you know and and you have decided to give your child this weapon you know this weapon is you know you're shocked when your kid becomes addicted to this and becomes depressive and unfortunately for a kid they don't have yet within them they don't possess the mechanism that it is to compromise so everything feels much larger when you're a kid right think about your first breakup whatever it was i don't know how old you were when you had your first breakup um but i think i was 13 it was like one of those like fake relationships but you know you think it's the end of the world everything becomes a suicide thing when you know you have a fallout with a friend you think it's the end of the world kids feel in a way that is so much bigger and grander than adults do and when you apply social media to that you know they're not able to deal with a hurtful comment i know that came as suspended comments on this but you know they're not able to deal with even a hurtful idea thinking that this person is prettier than them or more mature than them or wondering if guys like this better um they're not able to put that into the proper perspective because they have brains that are not developed and kanye in this regard and again this is not supposed this isn't to say everything he's ever done has been amazing and everything kim's on has been bad but i think that kim you know kind of represents someone that is very pro social media it's how she made her you know how she made her brands how she's made her living by giving more and more and more and more of herself and unfortunately she's not able to see the harmful effects of that she's not able to assess her own addiction and her own obsession with social media i mean to me you're talking about two billionaires you've got if north needs a creative outlet from her divorce kim could go buy her a ranch in wyoming literally tomorrow and say here's a whole ranch she could she could afford to bring pablo picasso back from the dead and say here paint with my daughter i mean she's got that much money she could she could buy her whatever she wants as a creative outlet she could buy her a plane and fly her to france um and you know have her dine amongst the stars this is not an average family that has to deal with sadness or has to find a creative outlet in a tricky spot because they don't have resources it is pointedly ridiculous to suggest that this is the only creative outlet that makes your child happy and quite frankly it doesn't matter if you make your ch if it makes your child happy you are the adult for that reason there's a lot of stupid things that kids want that they believe make themselves happy we are arriving more and more in a society where people don't know what it means to be an adult right they don't know they're they're constantly caving to what their kids want well this is what my kid wanted my kid just wanted social media so like i gave them because they like it and it makes them happy i don't care if it's giving them temporary happiness if you know that in the long run it's going to cause pain there it's going to cause addiction so you have that addiction you know how addicting social media is because you have that addiction um and so i just feel like kanye deserves to be defended in this one in this particular regard because any man who understands even how they use social media how men look at social media the fact that there's five million strangers how are you to know that amongst them are not pedophiles there's been you know pedophile networks that have been established on tick tock of people that are looking at kids why would you want your eight-year-old on to be observed on an app you know every second of their day this is different from you know moms that have social media and post their kids you know once in a blue moon when you are allowing your child to have social media you have no idea you know who you know who is looking at your kid and that is remarkably unfair to then castigate your your significant other or former significant other and pretend that this is an obsession it should be an obsession protecting your children and protecting our children should be an obsession so if kanye is obsessed with getting your daughter off social media then may i suggest that you develop that obsession like may i suggest that you develop wanting to protect your child from the world wanting your kid to grow up wanting your kid to be a normal third grader who wants to plan sleepovers with her girlfriends who wants to you know have do an art project i think for me i was wanting to do gymnastics and you know and jumping around like there are other creative outlets and if you are a parent and you really care about your child no matter what your child is going through you would want to protect them from the net you just you would 100 so we're speaking to a larger problem right now and i think this is like as i said like i don't think the kardashians are aware of their own addiction and obsession with social media so they would not recognize those symptoms in someone else they would they don't see any harm in it because they've made a living and again that's not to take a shot at kim i've met her she's very kind and she's very nice but you know social media is her life that's the point like she's she's a nice person but social media is her life and she's not seeing clear on this so just standing up for dads that kind of get caught like i just don't like the idea of the victim mentality of a woman saying oh he's obsessed and he's controlling and you know sure he may be obsessive and controlling about different aspects but on this particular one kanye west is 100 right and kim is in the wrong get that child off social media she's a child she's eight years old you know that it leads to an increase in suicide rates amongst kids these are devastating effects there are multiple stories out there of parents saying shoulda woulda coulda i wish i did not allow my eight-year-old to develop this addiction you know don't be that that parent that finds out too late because you don't know cam there was no social media when you were a kid you were allowed to be a kid you were allowed to be grubby you were allowed to have braces you were allowed to look weird and not develop that that sense of like being self-conscious about yourself because you're suddenly able to see all of these other kids and see what they look like you don't know that so right now what you're doing is you're experimenting with north you're experimenting with her you're experimenting with her psychology you're experimenting um and assuming that it's going to be okay i wouldn't let my child be the test on me for social media in this age and i don't think she should either so just throwing a little support toward kanye thanks guys for watching", "OG6XyFtmUWQ": "recently begun to immerse myself in old videos and interviews of dr martin luther king jr and i came across an interview of him from 1964 where he was underscoring the problems that were in black america at that time and here's what he mentioned school dropouts crime rates illegitimacy rioting and other social evils i find that list to be really interesting because he spoke that list 55 years ago and yet today across all of those categories we not only have the exact same problems but the problems have worsened how is that possible in a society that has experienced so much social progress that we are seeing a decline in the black community the statistics of illegitimacy crime rates and illiteracy have worsened he said it is both socially and morally suicidal to continue a pattern of deploring effects while failing to

beings right and that's an attack on the family because you can't have a functional relationship if you look up and every time you see a man you see a problem right at the same time you have policies i call it you know baby mama culture that are saying to women that you you can do it by yourself you can do it all by yourself being a single mom and listen you are you can right but you shouldn't have to so you routinely see this attack on the family and what's behind that in my opinion is government because in order for a government to grow that government needs to make sure you believe that every problem that you have they have an answer for not your mom and dad at home", "UsfOv_QlmWs": "ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage blech 6 national brand director and your host with a

well thank you guys for coming of course enjoy the rest of the show okay how are you doing up but you just standing right next to me so look we ready for interview how do you do what's your name Stephanie Stephanie is this your first rally yes it is how are you liking it so far loving and I'm absolutely loving and loving the things I'm learning everybody giving their perspectives and just contributing such a wonderful progressive movement I'm so glad to be a part of it and I'm excited are you feeling the energy in the room I'm sorry are you feeling all the energy in the room solutely I love it I feel like it's finally a safe space for like conservative abuse because we don't have a safe space in the media and even in public it's like hard to express your views but being in a room full of people who are all for being you know themselves and expressing their views freely I'm I'm here for you do you have a budget story because I noticed a lot of times people have a plexus story like that awakening for them did that happen to you at any point yes it did quite recently I can't remember the exact day in time but I was inspired by Rob Smith at first I saw him I believe on middle ground he's here today oh my gosh I would love to see him but yeah he inspired me first I'm seeing him on middle ground and his ideas and it was just like you know like that really like sticks with me and I feel like it's time for a change and then I started to see Candice Owens and Larry elder and then I feel like I was coming into myself I feel like I was a conservative my whole life but it's just that I was blinded by the media and blinded by other people's perspectives and how they try to shove it down your throat you know but hearing them and seeing their confidence and just seeing the facts that's really all it is the facts and I was just like this is me and this is Who I am and I'm gonna do everything I can to empower others to like see that in themselves too because a lot of people probably like this but they're just afraid to you know express their views because of what the media constantly portrays are you from Florida water born and raised you ought to get involved with the Florida chapter they have a table set up over there definitely get involved with them if you haven't already you'd be great for blogs is awesome thank you so thank you enjoy directors show Alicia hi how are you we have the black zip Florida assistant state director in the house pretty good you enjoying the show yeah I loved it I've been double duty and doing volunteering and watching the show so you've been doing everything yeah helping out watching the show trying to make sure everything goes well and a lot of people get the information that they need you are there I always see you online she's very passionate y'all she is very very passionate she takes no prisoners she goes really hard what inspires you to push so hard are you thinking something to block community needs or what pushes you to do that well I have a four-year-old son so that my four-year-old son is the reason that pushes me so hard especially with school choice in education because we are lacking a lot of education I just found out that they don't even teach phonics in school anymore so they don't even know how to read correctly they don't know how to pronounce the letters I best and those kind of things like that are very important and in order for those things to change we have to change our local leaders such as our City Council members go to our city commissioners been eating our district leaders we need to know all of those people if we don't then we're filling our state is there anything that you hope to tell people who are listening from Florida that are interested in maybe join the chapter or don't know about the chapter or anything you want to say to those folks today yeah if they're looking for any time to change at all that they should just join plexus if you're trying to figure out what's going on with my community why haven't things changed what's really going on join Blackston we'll be more than happy to tell you about all of the opportunities that we have education prison reform criminal justice all of those things were able to tell you about it all so that way you're making the right decisions with your life thank you so much Alicia for doing this enjoy the rest of the show let's see who else we have out here interview so far let's see if we can keep this streak going so thank you sir yeah let's do what tell everybody your name what are you doing today saw Michael bloomin jr. I'm running for US Congress in Florida district 21 against Lois Frankel and I'm here to support the blex it movement I actually came from a vulnerable population I was born at Fort Benning Georgia and my dad he turned to drugs and alcohol after Vietnam he abused and raped my mom he abused me I grew up in section 8 housing so I saw firsthand what it takes to overcome adversity that's what I'm trying to share with the community so I definitely see what's inspired you to run for office now do you do you see any pushback from people typically this with anything when it comes to you running for office like what being a conservative obviously isn't easy nowadays right we're being silenced so what do you hear a lot when you're out there or campaigning what is the main thing I'm a compassionate conservative for the community that's where we got to come together duty honor country we got to come together we got to accept each other we got to love each other I'm a judeo-christian I'm Catholic I'm involved in a community so after the military I published three books so I'm really trying to help people been abused recover military transition so the major thing is when you come from a vulnerable population is the funding source so that's why we got to support small business overs I've fought in Washington DC for individuals with disabilities minorities and women because they're the future so a lot of times people don't just think because you don't come from money that you can't rise above so when you hear the speakers here today you see how they're they got a personal story and that's what people can relate to when they're trying to make a decision not only at the voting booth but for their family do you have a favorite speaker my favorite speaker honestly Oh brewer from here Oh Jack Brewer it was up at CPAC and when he prayed over me and that's what we need we need prayers for the campaign you know vote balloon Ling you know it's blooming 2020 dot-com but we need people to come together so and I'd love to come partner with your organization because that's what we do we come together we support each other it doesn't matter you know if you're black you're white you're man you're female because when I served in a military we had an American flag on our shoulder that's what was important being an American and that's what we so I commend you for what you're doing I love this country I love what you're doing and we got to support each other because that's how we're going to drive change and we need to do that in US Congress hey man thank you bro thank you so much for taking time with us god bless you much luck in your campaign too as well all right let's see who we got let's see who we got let's go ahead how you doing today sir all right what's going on how you doing I'm just trying to flex it at the blacks it reflects it their blogs it doesn't flex it's a hashtag hashtag flex it at the Black Sea how you liking the show so far show so far so good it's your first one yeah really so are you so far you liking it you you feel like you're gonna come back again what's your feeling you got give this to the school would you freely halfway yeah I mean everyone has their own individual thing that they're talking about so yeah it's very enlightening as far as the commentary you know it's kind of catches you off-guard a bit but definitely I wake you up any particular speaker you're looking forward to at all or just just everybody I mean I came to see Candice but then the the Indian guy dish the nuts Benesh whatever yeah he Fanta yeah he caught me off guard and I'm his entire story from the beginning to the end and then the guy named Larry elders you know his story is so real how they tell their story about the blackness and about their upbringing that is a bit shocking so let me ask you to cuz you said your first one what what brought you out there wit what was the moment where you said I'm gonna go through this blog the rally was anything in particular that caught your eye like what brought you here today well I mean that was Candace yeah Candace brought me here I came to see Candace well I hope you enjoy the rest of the show

stories we love you guys and don't forget to donate all right so long", "PwJ2rjtu5e8": "many words which have once held very serious meetings have come to take on a different definition over the last couple of years as democrats have desperately tried to grapple with the fact that they are no longer able to manipulate americans with broad claims and broad strokes of racism sexism misogyny and the like words like racism which today most nearly means anything or anyone that disagrees with the liberal and terms like white nationalism which today in this room and upon this floor most nearly means that it's election time america it's time for the left to do what they do best divide distract and hope to keep their most important voting block to their party which is black americans angry and emotional and reactive enough to keep voting for the same party that has systematically destroyed our families sent our men to prison and deferred all of our dreams america and and more importantly black america is waking up to the ploy the bad acting the folk concern these hearings it's not going to stop black america from breaking the change of victimhood and it's certainly not going to stop me from being one of the loudest voices against it", "aqwGvPgBAGk": "what it comes down to is that sexuality race these are attributes these these are not these they should not Define your character and this is what the left gets wrong all the time me being black does not define my character that you should not know what I think because of the color of my skin should not Define your character it should not say instantly whether I should know oh I should know everything about this guy and what he thinks because he's married to a man that that's crazy for aggressive taxes yeah exactly it must be for progressive tax right he must there thereby assign through all these socialist policies unfortunately because they've allowed these things to become identifying things not just attributes not just oh you know I'm I'm five foot seven I'm black I'm female right now they want to turn into you are female therefore it's a it's a character thing it defines everything about you it means that you have to think this way but by the way it must be a feminist because you are a female what", "YSBYiLjP9vM": "most black people don't even know their own history you sit down and you have black people that are advocating for planned parenthood and nobody's talking about the quiet black genocide that's taking place in america right now because our birth rate has completely stagnated and we're the only ones 61 percent of all neighbors latino so when the democrats say open borders open borders what they're really saying is votes boast because the black people are not going to be able to stay in our party much longer to let them know that planned parenthood was created by an avowed racist margaret sanger who said that her purpose was to exterminate the black race most black people don't know that and yet they go out and they say conservatives are are crazy because they want to defund planned parenthood i want defunded because the black the black birth rate has has stagnated okay so i'm actually all about black and power which is why when people actually find me long form and listen to what i say it clicks and they say oh my god and then they research margaret sanger and then they research the black birth rate and they realize that we have literally we are paying politicians taking to tear apart our families and to make sure that we don't have a place in america", "R1POYCGgwjM": "we have all allowed ourselves to buy into a system of welfare in many ways we become so reliant on the government food doesn't come from a grocery store food grows up in the soil it starts by mothers taking control again becoming the ceos of our households understanding that we are not going to fight with teachers and board of education members for rights over our children it starts with us we have to stop giving our money to companies that hate us the idea that we continually give our money to these corporations and these companies that think nothing of us that want us gone when i saw that chase bank who i'd been a member of for 15 years was starting to push people out based on their ideas you can't bank with us anymore i got my cash and i left it was that easy", "ecilV2Jb9GI": "when you start to breed a culture of political correctness there's always going to be something that bubbles beneath the surface because like you said you cannot talk about the truth you can go around the truth by the end of the day there it is and it starts to sort of swirl like you know like a like a hurricane on the map that's just waiting to hit and then people go well where did this come from where did this come from things were going well well they weren't going well you were pretending things were going well you pretending that the world was getting better uh and you were too afraid to discuss the truth", "KXwu7f-hj7o": "if you're paying attention to the stuff that i'm paying attention to the conversation is cracking people are getting tired of this rhetoric we're being tired to talk that we are being told by you guys to hate people based on the color of their skin or to be fearful we want results we want policies we are tired of rhetoric and the numbers show that white supremacy and white nationalism is not a problem that is harming black america let's start talking about putting fathers back in the home let's start talking about god and religion and shrinking government because government has destroyed black american homes and every single one of you know that and i think many people should feel ashamed for what we have done and what congress has turned into it's days of our lives in here and it's embarrassing", "BqcWw8iGL6s": "but looting in immediate response to that why would we put up with that we shouldn't put up with that but the reason why we do is because the Democrats see some advantage in this right so right now you have a bunch of criminals that love black lives matters organization they love when a black person dies and we don't know what the reasons are we don't know what happened but it signals to them that they are now allowed to run into the streets and grab whatever they want whether it's from Target whether it's from Walmart and what's remarkable also is that these corporations are standing behind black lives matter right they're they're pouring money into these corporations and I remember most notably during the George Floyd riots uh Target even came out and said we don't even care that we were right and looted because we just stand with black lives matter that's not a normal thing for a corporation to do when it's losing money so that means that a corporation must be getting something else right what is it what are they investing in when they invest in the lie that is black lives matter what is the return", "1ZfXgchV6JE": "that's the number one question that I get on the road parents to go what do I do what do I do when I look back at them and I get kind of angry because I'm listen I'm like listen to what you're asking me you're asking me what you should do with your child when a predator is at Bay right I mean the the concept that you're asking what you should do when somebody is trying to harm your child because that's what's going on in these classrooms whether it's the pornography that's being taught the critical race Theory that's being taught the classroom environment has become predatorial and you're asking me what you should do what would you do if any predator went after your child you would yank them out of the school you would fight tooth and nail to make sure they were not exposed to this stuff I just want to remind any parent that is watching this show you are the parent not the government not the teachers you are the parents and you should always make sure that your children are not becoming prey", "X9fyF-7EG-8": "it's important that that we understand that you will never hold what you hate that's a very important concept so i'm going to repeat it again you will never hold what you hate you cannot have what you hate and what you're naturally conditioned to believe is wrong right if you hate rich people you're never going to have wealth it doesn't work like that okay so when people tell you to be bitter and to be angry because somebody has more than you what they're telling you to do is to accept poverty as a natural state to never go after and to never have more if people are telling you that you should hate white people you're never going to have peace and integration you can't speak out on both sides of your mouth you can't say that you hate a particular race but you wish for there to be peace for all the women in here we've watched probably the ugliest version of feminism that we will ever live through which is what's going on in this country today radical left-wing feminists who teach us that we should hate men well you let me tell you something if you hate men you're never going to have a family if you're a woman you're never going to have a stable loving family if they're telling you to hate and reject the things that it takes to make a stable loving family i've thought so much over this this past couple of years where it has felt a bit like a rocket ship to go from a girl on youtube which is saying what i believe uh to being on this on this rocket ship and having a platform to speak to so many people right and and to have to be so attacked personally and also that as a victim i say it as a point of interest like a girl can get up and make a youtube video and start to question things on the left and to watch overnight my reputation go down the drain to watch them uh you know refer to me as a house negro to say that i hate my own race which is pointedly ridiculous you know candace do you have any black friends i don't need black friends because my family's black in case you missed it right everyone around me is black my dad's in the front row there dad stand up [Applause] fact check true my dad's black see no one believes me but these are the things that they do you know they accuse you of sympathizing with white white supremacists if you develop conservative principles if you have the audacity to think for yourself and think about how pointedly ridiculous that is what black person in america would be a white supremacist think about that why would i want to help build a society that i can't live in it's ridiculous that is the stuff last year i think in in the highest point of ridiculousness they accused me and my rhetoric of inspiring a mosque shooting in new zealand i mean this this is how high the stakes are when you become a minority that ordains to not only think for themselves but to speak for themselves to speak out and to remind people i'm not a slave okay you can't tell me what to think you can't tell me what to do you're allowed to disagree with me [Applause] i come to you guys because i think that the stakes are high i think that they've never been higher in america when we start talking about people that are demanding socialism and relying on the lack of education that people have because of our poisonous school system to push through terrible terrible policies and if you think it can happen to america look at venezuela look at how quickly it happened to venezuela when socialism took hold i often think about what the left is after through all of these various um entities of crazy that they they've established right i mean women can be men now men can be women you can pick your gender no you can't okay you just can't you're born either male or female that's it right well i think about feminists feminists going out there and and speaking against men and and making it this error of me too right and and uh it's got to be really scary to be married now what is the left after what are they after the answer is simple they are after the breakdown of family the breakdown of family everything destroys family right when you get women to hate men you can no longer have a strong family and why do they want to break down the family when you get men to want to be women and say that's woke that's amazing that's progressive when you tell women that there's something fundamentally wrong with wanting to stay at home and raise children and tell them they need to go work and climb the corporate ladder and forget about having children right which by the way being a mother has got to be the toughest job in the world i have to imagine raising good human beings has got to be the toughest job in the world right when they say there's something wrong about that there's something oppressive about that that is them trying to break down the family the nuclear family so the question then becomes why why the answer is because you cannot grow government when there is a strong family you can't they have to break down the family before they break down the family they have to break down the institution of religion they need to make sure we believe in nothing but the government as a solution to every single problem we have this is why the left routinely mocks god i've never seen it strange it is you don't have to be religious but there's something really wrong when it becomes funny to mock people that believe in something bigger than themselves right you don't you you take a look at the things that they say and that's what it's all about it all points to trying to create an industry of government dependence the experiment was black america we know how government dependence works okay we know how welfare worked out 22 trillion dollars have been deposited into the welfare industry and black americans are poorer today than when welfare began it was a scam we lost okay when you incentivize bad behavior you lose when you incentivize women not to marry the father of their children you lose this is what we have to change we cannot allow them to socialize america it's gone too far i hold this issue close to my heart for reasons that didn't make sense to me when i was growing up i know many of you have heard me speak about my grandfather who is just the most incredible person in the world he is from north carolina fayetteville north carolina everything that he lived through was to give me the opportunities that i have today my grandfather growing up in a sharecropping farm my grandfather picking cotton my grandfather laying tobacco out to dry in an attic in fayetteville north carolina heat when he was just five years old right my grandfather though never complaining growing up with three okay kkk right shooting bullets into his home my grandfather not having the opportunity to go to school because he had to work he had he went through all of that so that i could live the life that i lead and when i think about growing up in his household which he cared about god first and foremost was the number one rule we had to sit around the table and read the bible every morning for breakfast that's what he believed in he really did and i was embarrassed of it when i was a kid so we applaud now but i was so embarrassed of it i really was my my grandparents were so religious everything was a prayer you could do anything and my grandfather would turn it into a prayer he really would and um i used to believe that he had the magic and i'll never forget really believing my grandfather had a direct line to god that as soon as he put his head down god would hear whatever my grandfather told him and it would terrify me when i was a kid because when i got into trouble he would work us into the prayers and there was one night where i was i was cold and i jumped up and i you know in my formative years i lived in my grandparents home and i turned up the heat and that was a big no-no in our in my granddaddy's home you do not turn up the heat meal tonight and i had to have been all but eight years old and my grandfather i came down in the morning for the big southern breakfast that he would fix us every morning and i said good morning because if we didn't say good morning we didn't get a plate he would not serve us a plate because he was all about respect first and foremost and then my grandfather worked me into one of his prayers that morning and he said dear god please help candace to realize she shouldn't be touching the heat i was eight so obviously i jumped up and i ran upstairs crying hysterically and my grandfather followed me and i said grandad why did you have to tell god couldn't we just keep this [Music] between us i laughed at that story because it was just i really believed it and it just it really speaks to the values and the rules so many rules that we grew up in in my grandfather's home and and he just he loved his family so so much my grandmother um really uh you know he was in control of the house but she was in control of the house you know what i mean that special relationship where the woman is in control of the house so my grandfather would say something wasn't happening and my grandmother would shoot him a look and then he'd wake up the next day and suddenly exactly what she wanted to happen was happening in the household i grew up in the in that feeling that i that i talk about in the 90s errors of the winslows of the cosby's and the number one thing that my grandfather uh put into my heart was that i wasn't a victim i didn't learn how to be a victim i my grandfather my my parents i was never told i couldn't do something because of the color of my skin i just wasn't taught it growing up i didn't realize that this would become an issue as i got into the real world that i was supposed to think like a victim because of the color of my skin my grandfather after uh our formative years and being in connecticut and raising his family retired back down to fayetteville north carolina where he lives today and he purchased the sharecropping farm that he grew up on that that is what's on the line that is an example of the american dream that you can start anywhere anywhere in this country no matter your race your color or your sex but if you follow some simple rules right if you work hard and if you stay out of trouble if if you have children after you get married this country will reward you that's what america is all about we've never cared about about people's skin color since i've been growing up and yet suddenly people believe that it does matter that's what we have to fight to protect the american dream is what i work day in and day out to fight to protect because i want to make sure when i wake up when i have children someday that it's the same exact america that i grew up in i want to make sure every person in this room remains hopeful if you're a minority know that you're not alone you're not we we are not alone there are there is not just one black conservative in this world there's not i might be making a lot more noise than the other ones but there are plenty of us and it's time for us to take a stand and start talking about the values that are actually going to transform our future and i will wrap this up by reminding you all that we're free so go be free god bless you thank you so much for coming", "AE1MbeP6KN8": "it's it's almost like the lens of racism um is is preventing people from being able to accurately assess what's happening they don't know that that bad exists people have a bad day you get a police officer you just be having a horrible day you never know maybe he's been up since on the road since 3am and his boss is coming out everybody has a bad day right including police officers we know Society is not perfectable but the left sort of sells black individuals to say that this idea um that it's like anything bad that happens to is because of your skin color not because of this is a like you know just the life Welcome To Life condition of life there are people who are people suck people are mean people say mean things um and you can have a bad day and for some reason black people have started to adopt this idea that we are special snow we are special snowflakes we are literally Society special snowflakes anything that happens bad to us it is

many people who love this country who love god and who are going to stand for what's right [Applause] it just gives me energy when i see it all so what i want to talk about is two major things i want to talk about policing and i want to talk about the power of the mind policing in america the way people are portraying police officers today is shameful the men and women who put on that uniform who pin that badge on who walk away from their families their aspirations and dreams in their personal life to support to die for perfect strangers should get a round of applause in my personal opinion there is no greater sacrifice than to die for people that you don't know and police officers do that every single day i want to give you a quick story about how i became a police officer never thought about being a cop a day of my life i was growing up i got arrested when i was eight years old for smoking weed in a vacant house so my first experience with police weren't that it wasn't that flavorful in a good way but i got to a point in my life where i need to make a positive decision as a strong man i had to support my child and i and i applied for everything in the city of tucson and the police department that application was one of them never thought about it one night i had a disagreement with my son's mom at the time right i think we were arguing about like an engagement ring or something like that the next morning i wake up i get a phone call from the tucson police department and i will never forget i i picked up the phone they said it's tucson police department and i'm like she called the police on me why would she do such a thing and then they said hey mr tatum you apply for the job and i'm like okay yeah yeah whatever you need whatever y'all need i'm down now but i knew nothing about policing i only watched cops when i was young so i knew nothing about what was going on and i said i need to do a ride-along so i pulled up on uh the officer his name is sean payne i'll never forget sean payne he's the greatest officer i've ever met i pulled up on him in my private vehicle i said hey man i want to do a ride along and he let me ride with him and it blew my mind we started from changing the flat tire of an elderly lady to going what we call code 3 licensed siren 70 miles per hour down the road almost died twice to save a kid who was currently trying to commit suicide when they kicked the front door in they went in i was able to look around the corner the kid was literally in the back cutting his wrist and sean payne saved his life and i'll never forget that [Applause] and so after all this happened sean got in the car we got back in the police car and i remember my heart was just racing before we went to the call he was asking about my family and so when we got back in the car he began to ask me about my family again and i couldn't even remember i had a family i was like what are you talking about i was completely mind blown that that man had did what he what i saw him do and at that point in my life it's the first time i ever saw a hero a real hero now i played football my whole life and i thought those guys were great nothing against football players and athletes but when i saw that man turn into a hero and save lives and he'd do it every single day it impacted me and i became a police officer and contrary to what some of these leftist lunatics will tell you as a black man on a majority white hispanic police department i did everything on the police department i was a field training officer i was a general instructor i was on the swat team i was a spokesperson for the police department that mean i represented the police department in front of the news representing our values and different things that we had to speak on i did all of those things and i loved every minute of my service as a police officer and today i see a huge issue with the way they're portraying the actions of the men in blue today i i think it's a it's a tremendous issue that i see because they perpetuate a complete lie this whole police oppression police brutality it's a lie it is a lie i'm gonna keep it 100. it's a lie do police officers budget people yeah that's far few in between they're not out here just hunting black folks down that's not happening i'm not afraid of the police officer when i leave my house cause i'm black they're gonna pull me over for no reason that's a lie if i'm not committing crimes then i'm not gonna interact with police often at all and there's not gonna be a time where a police dog's gonna go gun me down while i'm sleeping in bed that's not gonna happen they lied about what happened to brianna taylor they lied about what happened to jacob blake they fluffed the story and what happened to george floyd they leave out details that leave black people afraid and terrified when they shouldn't be i tell young people all the time don't be afraid of the police won't you become a police officer won't you pick up an application put down the protests and signs and all that stuff why don't you become a police officer so you can patrol in your community and you can be the difference that you want to see how is that too difficult and i want to say this because it just this is the story that's hot right now and it just made it made my brain explode why in the world is jacob blake's name on football helmets why are their names on the back of jerseys being flaunted as individuals who are heroic there is nothing heroic about assaulting a woman fighting police officers running trying to go to the front of the car with a knife in your hand there's nothing heroic about that and nobody wanna keep it real but i'm gonna keep it real there is no excuse to resist the rest and i tell young people this all the time i can't control what every police officer does you can only train them so much what do you expect they're not god but what you can do is you control how you react to police officers when they pull you over follow the law follow the rules sometimes you may be pulled over for no reason it mean it doesn't matter but what what can what you can control is what matters put your hands on the steering wheel be respectful you don't you it's not a it's not a a debate this is not curbside justice you don't need to make a point right now you need to you need to live through this interaction and it's not just reserved for black people it's for all of us we all get pulled over by police and as a former police officer it's no one color or one race that i'm more afraid of and i'm not afraid of race in general i'm afraid of a gun i'm afraid of you killing me it has nothing to do with your race and when we decide as a society to work on the introspective portion meaning working on yourself and how you interact i think we'll have better interactions with police officers i want to jump into another subject honest along those same lines but a gentleman i was debating with we were at a church it wasn't a debate it was a conversation and the reason why we were able to have a conversation and not necessarily the debate is because we understood one fundamental principle is that we're both children of god we were children we are children of god first that goes beyond politics that goes beyond anything else so we were able to have a dialogue and a conversation one thing that bothered me that this man said and i have the utmost respect for him is that he had mentioned that he cannot wait to the day where his child or grandchild he's a black man will have the same opportunities as the white pastor's grandchildren and and it bothered me a little bit as a christian because i i'm questioning what god are you serving what what god are you who are you reading about because the last time i checked there is no door a white man is going to close that god is already open for me i don't believe in white privilege i believe in christ's privilege and for the life of me i could not understand how that pastor could perceive things that way because you become what you believe in your mind if you're walking around every day and you're perceiving you're going to have negative interactions with you're going to have negative interactions if you're walking around and you think everybody's after you the white man is following me around and everywhere i go and they just trying to get me i got to work three or four times as hard as everybody else that's what you're gonna get but if you keep in your mind that i'm a powerful child of god meaning that the words that i speak will be manifested the things that i say the god that i serve can manifest the things that i want to happen and if you believe that you will achieve it i do not waste a moment of my life complaining and making excuses excuses will get you nowhere in life nowhere i spend my time dreaming about accomplishing great things for other people and that's the difference serving is where we build who we are service if you want to be successful or the things that you want to see happen you need to serve another person in that manner for instance if you want to be prosperous when you when it comes to money finances then how about you give to other people and help them become prosperous that's how it will come back to you and i just i really want us to hone in on this is the the service component we need to serve more we need to have the servant mentality more our minds shouldn't be to argue or be upset with our brothers and sisters is how can i love you and serve you like christ would how do we do that and once we start getting to that level i think that we'll see a bit of a better america we'll see a better place and it makes me happy to see everybody in here of all races colors ages you name it sitting here together listening to such a good um event and when i see that i see an example of what america really looks like this is america [Music] this is america [Applause] where we love one another we appreciate one another we can sit next to one another not looking at color of your skin where you came from where you're going but that we are all children [Music] of the most high god [Applause] and it's it's really that simple it's that simple it's that simple i want to finish it with this and if anybody watch my youtube channel i say i'm gonna finish and i'm about 30 40 more minutes and i'm still talking but i think we need to be active in our pursuit of political things right this event is not about republican or democrat i could care less my the way i look at politics the way i look at life everything in in my life i look at it from this from a spiritual sense what would christ want me to do in this arena when you talk about crucial things like abortion gay marriage all that stuff that make people all weird on the inside you should be focusing on what what is god saying about this and when i look at what god says about who you who you should marry what marriage really is when i look at what god is saying about giving life i believe that life starts at conception not perception [Music] when you look at those things that's where you should get your political stance from not these party lines and i find it very mysterious when i see christians going on a side that's counterproductive to christ counterproductive to god how in the world how in the world are you christian and you see these politicians out here advocating for you to go to a clinic and get rid of god's children every time you get rid of a life that's get belongs to god that's not yours how do you support politicians like that it is beyond me when you see politicians that are more concerned with the same sex thing then they are concerned with the house of god we have a problem nothing and there's nothing against if you want to sleep with whoever you want to sleep with that's something you ain't got nothing to do with me that's between you and god i didn't make the rules that's him don't kill the messenger but at the end of the day i want to see a person who's going to represent the faith i want to see somebody who's going to say no church can stay open because it's essential [Applause] i better stop before i start preaching it's really that simple it's that simple it's that simple if we actually produce what we believe meaning that we stuck by the rudiments of christ stuck by the rudiments of what the bible says there ain't no way in the world we won't be a better country there's no way we won't get along more there's no way we can't create policies to make everybody you know and not make everybody happy but be productive for each one of the people that are sitting in this room there's no way we can't do that so i'll encourage you because i don't know what what side of aisle you sit on and i don't even care i will encourage you to think about what christ would do how christ would want you to behave and i want you to do that and i just want to finish by saying thank you thank you guys for coming out here thank you for being here you could have been anywhere else you could have gone to any other event which is probably hard to believe since candice owens is here but you could have done any other thing but you found yourself dedicated committed here to support the blexit movement so i just want to say thank you give yourselves a round of applause god bless you and the show will continue [Music] you", "HcnwJyFcQsM": "Harvey Weinstein Eminem plus a p-diddy solution to NFL protesting my name is Candace Owens and you

ground and the next minute bail the world discovers that you've been covering up for a serial rapist America voted for a misogynist said every actor and actress everywhere just after they had got finished smooching up to Harvey Weinstein we know celebrities this is different if we've learned one thing from your undying support of Woody Allen and the Clintons it's that rape is totally fine so long as it's financed by globalists Thank You Hillary for being a constant beacon of strength hope and determination for me and I and some other young women you better role model an inspiration and the voice of reason uncertain times sniffle the point is that I was really hoping that Bill Clinton a rapist would be in the White House you taught us that woman can be raped so long as it's by your husband this is me holding my breath for Stephen Colbert depend a musical number on the horrible actions of Harvey Weinstein also holding my breath for a newly organized woman's March with 2.0 [\u00a0__\u00a0] hat designs okay can I at least get a Kimmel cry come on Jimmy you cried for sessile the lion you can at least squeeze one out for Weinstein victims thanks Jimbo and speaking of men who disrespect women in our somehow celebrating Hollywood have you heard Eminem's new diss track personally as a former fan I was a little disappointed after years of hearing about how you want to rape and kill your ex-wife and even your mom calling Trump and Steve Bannon racist felt a little PG like I'm on a diet sugar-free she in fact the only people that should be offended by Eminem's diss track is CNN because plagiarism is a no-no races and religions racism racism racist issue racist racist elements that's right um we know where you got those lines next topic Vegas a horrible tragedy which results in the left demanding that we give up our right to bear arms we need stricter regulations yeah because that worked so well in Chicago fact number one gun violence has significantly decreased over the last 15 years don't believe me try shutting off NBC and thinking plus researching for yourself fact number two stop it we hate facts the NRA is the definition of gun regulations stop blaming them every time a mass shooting occurs not a single member of the NRA has ever committed a mass shooting in this country I mean blaming the NRA every time a shooting occurs would be as ridiculous as blaming Donald Trump every time a racist act occurs in this country awkward facts number three disallowing people the right to bear arms is just not smart okay technically that's not a fact it's an opinion the point is that my personal opinion is that giving the government access to automatic weapons while the citizens do not hold the same right is not the most well thought out idea and to people that say it is aren't you guys the same ones that have been calling our government rigged and set up in racists since November 8th of last year now you want those rigged and racist people to be the only ones holding weapons how's that work how's your brain work look with everything that's gone on in the past week there can be only one headline to rule them all yes in case you guys missed it Diddy formerly puffy before that Puff Daddy wins every single award this week Diddy nay Puff Daddy tweeted that he had a dream that us black people would one day own our own league and there we could drop to our knees and protest really I mean in the 1950s Martin Luther King had a dream that we could all live together peacefully it's now 2017 and black billionaires are dreaming about segregation please do it Diddy please if I don't live long enough to see self-imposed segregation it all would have been for naught thanks for watching guys if you guys enjoy these videos please

all black dorm is racist and this is what this is my problem is that somehow we've arrived suddenly into a place where black Americans are authoring the exact same thing that our ancestors fought to end discrimination segregation but we've made a spoon inside but this is a positive form of discrimination this is a positive form of segregation because we're choosing it it's wrong it's just wrong I mean I don't see how you can't just plainly say an all black dorm is racist it should be all black all white off but it's racist it should never exist at all okay you sleep where you sleep you don't like sleeping there you leave the school you can decide to go somewhere else but we don't play that game on college campuses we don't play you know x amount of people quotas are going to be allowed into school it needs to be a merit-based I don't care what color you are let me see how you perform let me see and yes maybe looking at the activities without knowing what color you are I might say okay let's see is a little lower but he has taken on he was playing full-time basketball and all that so I think he'd be a good fit again race does not need to be present for that termination to be made the only thing that we can't consider so for example we shouldn't consider racism", "VE1daS-eV5A": "you know i had this conversation which i kind of wanted to reiterate i was talking to my husband and um he put up the perfect love that a great analogy he said the left is like the titanic i want you to think about that for a second right a bunch of liberals got on board right and said not even god can sink this ship right not even god can sink this ship all in the ocean everybody's it's amazing the media is on their side this ship is amazing it's never going to go down and then they hit a little iceberg and they said oh that's all right just a little iceberg it's the titanic not even god can sink the titanic it's a little iceberg and he likened that to when they when they hit me in the media right oh it's all right we'll get rid of her right she was she was a little loud but we'll get rid of her we'll smear her we'll say she supports hitler we'll say she hates herself we'll say she's a self-hating black it's fine we'll get rid of her it's just a little iceberg but that was just the tip of the iceberg see i was just the tip what was buried beneath was all of blexit it was 60 years of injustice done to the minority community in america [Applause] and now they're panicking because they realize they have a problem and you know what they didn't put enough lifeboats on the titanic they don't really know what's going to happen to the left anymore but liberals don't know what to think because suddenly black americans are waking up and ordaining to think for themselves [Applause] the challenge i have always presented i have never gotten on a stage and told people who to vote for what to vote for why they should vote because i don't consider blexit to be a political organization we're not we are an organization that focuses on free thinking the ability to say what you think and the ability to describe to somebody why you think it that's the most important part not just thinking something but knowing why you think it why why is such an important question i ask people all the time why do you fight why do you get up why did you show up and come to blexit today what is driving you and the actions that you do day in and day out i know what drives me i tell people all the time the story and it's i'm actually just floored that i get to say on this stage tonight it's going to be extra special but um you know for me running around the nation and speaking on college campuses has been something like a nightmare it's basically just rooms full of toddlers people crying over privileged telling me that they're oppressed when they live in the greatest nation if you live in america today you are the most over privileged people that have ever lived in the face of human history that is the truth okay and so i used to i play this game where i the first thing i do when i get on a college campus is i say before we get started because you know i got tons of protesters there usually i have black lives matter in the back just waiting for me to say something at one event at ucla they actually had a group of people that were playing beyonce music music trying to drown out the sound so my voice couldn't be heard you have antifa outside making physical threats so i start the beginning i say before we get started we don't have to yell at each other i'm going to ask a very simple question in this room okay it's 2019 in america how many college students in this room this is what i ask think that america is a more racist country today than it was in the 1940s sixty percent of the hands go up sixty percent why are you even sending your kids to school seriously sixty percent of the hands go off i say you got to be kidding me that is brainwashed right there that is media brainwashing at work and what drives me is that because that's what makes me angry so many of you guys have followed me since the beginning since my red pill black days right youtube when i realized that something was wrong i decided to start a youtube channel i didn't know where it was gonna go i didn't know that people were gonna find me and start sharing my videos but i knew something was really rotten and i wanted to present a different perspective because what seemed to happen to the black family seemed to be systematic in the 1960s they came around and they started offering welfare right knocking on doors yeah you need some welfare for your family government help let me tell you something the bigger government gets the smaller the individual gets okay government is trying to replace family you have a problem they don't want you to go to god they want you to go to government right we have a solution the experiment was black america the experiments when lbj created the great society act was black america we're going to give them a little something just a little bit of something right not much they're not going to get ahead but it'll keep them coming back it created addicts i call this government addicts addicted to government i don't know anybody who has stayed on welfare and gotten ahead in their life because it wasn't built to help them get ahead of their lives it was built to help them get addicted to government it is a drug okay and they knew what they were doing because here's here is the plan once you break down the family right you know what's going to happen to the youth when you don't have mom and dad at home around a table telling you what's right and what's wrong where's the youth going to go they're going to pursue that paternity somewhere else they're going to run to the streets suddenly hip-hop artists become mom and dad beyonce and jay-z become mom and dad right you put on a record and you're learning something right the angry hip-hop waters are telling you how you should live your life and that's what happened and then they seized control of the education system and they started brainwashing because they know the single mom she had to be at work right so it's okay school is free drop off your kid at school the public school system is free fight for the free school system and what happens you end up with a bunch of brain washed children who believe they're victims before they even try to get out they're bitter and they're angry at the world before they even try to attempt to make something of themselves this is the systemic oppression that exists today our education system and the systematic breakdown of family in the 19 in the 1960s there was a guy named patrick moynihan who used to come out with a report in the 1960s he came up with the report on single mothers and he said oh my goodness we have a problem in the black community the single motherhood rate in the 1960s was 23 percent he said this is an epidemic 23 single motherhood rate in the black community and they all said oh this is an epidemic today as we stand and sit in this room the single motherhood rate in the black community is 74 you want to know why atheism is becoming mainstream why you see people mocking people i mean i was floored to see on the view joy behar boo mocking mocking the vice president because he's believes in jesus christ right because he said that he doesn't go out to eat with another woman without his wife she was mocking his values it's become mainstream and popular encourage to mock god why because you have to be the government needs atheism that's what they want they don't want you to believe in anything they don't want you to believe in family they don't want you to believe in god they don't want you to believe in anything but government and that's what we're trying to reverse that's what we have to reverse if we're going to fix the issues in our community i tell people all the time that i was lucky um i don't know which way i was going to end up i was a liberal you guys know i started on the left in the same way but i was fortunate that in my formative years i grew up in my grandfather's house at my grandmother's house and it was you know a little different my grandfather grew up when there was actually real racism in america right not just oh you offended me in my feelings so i'm gonna call you a racist i disagree with you so you're a racist right real racism he grew up in the segregated south his first job was when he was five years old laying tobacco out to dry on a sharecropping farm this is what it was in the south in north carolina in fayetteville one of 12 brothers and sisters but he got up every single day and he went to work there was no nonsense he's picked cotton before there was no nonsense he grew up with the real kkk right not i don't like the president so we're going to say the kkk is back and now buck bill can't go outside the real kkk and even when he tells us those stories when he tells us the stories of what it was like with the kkk he never sounds like a victim it's exactly how you should say he used to say my my daddy the kkk used to come around our house and my daddy would grab the shotgun and shoot back at them boys talk about that power there was no victimhood and the amazing thing is he married my grandmother when she was set when she they were 17 years old came up north married my grandmother and never once in their household did my grandfather say anything bad about white people i i wasn't raised to view myself as less than i simply never learned how to be a victim that's the way things were that wasn't the society that i grew up in instead this is this is shocking my grandparents believed in some other stuff really crazy stuff i'll tell you first and foremost they believed in god right faith something bigger than themselves when i was growing up we used to have these big my grandpa used to fix big southern breakfast says i should be overweight you see grits eggs bacon pancakes hot chocolate every single morning around the table and we'd have to read from the bible me and my brothers and sisters we'd have to read from the bible every single morning he'd go around and he'd ask us questions we were on our best behavior i was scared because as a child i believed that through my grandfather's praying he had an instant direct line to god and when we would act up he would incorporate us into the prayer and i always tell this story and he might not remember it but one night i was i was cold so i got up in the middle of the night and i turned the heat up in our room we had a me and my store had bunk beds and you weren't supposed to play with the heat in granddad's house but i played with the heat and couldn't read it but we woke up and it was very hot and i went down for breakfast and and you know i said good morning because if we didn't say good morning he wouldn't serve us our plate you couldn't get food so you sit around everybody else got a plate you couldn't get your food if you didn't say good morning but i was i said good morning i was ready for my plate granddad broke out into prayer and he won't believe what he did he said dear heavenly father please help candace to realize she shouldn't be finishing with the heat i got up from the table and i ran and i started crying and i just said why did you have to tell god i came between the family you haven't tell god that fear that fear right of my grandfather's rules and knowing that there was something bigger that was watching me that had to put me on my best behavior in the end that's what that's what saved me but not in the beginning because when i went to school i was embarrassed about that it wasn't cool to be a person that said oh i just you know we read the bible this morning you don't say that in school you don't say that in secular america it's not cool to read the bible in the morning it's not cool to talk about praying and i went down a very liberal route i say this all the time i took the most liberal route to conservatism there ever was i was embarrassed of how faithful my grandparents were all of that embarrassed me but by the grace of god i was saved i really was [Applause] because those things that felt like freedom going out sneaking out doing what you wanted to do partying drinking right experimenting all that thing that felt like freedom eventually it started to feel like bondage it started to feel like bondage what is it about liberalism it's so free that you feel you feel like you're being enslaved somehow right you look up and you have nothing you don't believe in family you don't believe in faith because yolo you're free well what do you have to show for anything if you don't have a family intact my grandfather is a happy story because when he retired him and my grandmother moved back down south to fayetteville north carolina where he started and he purchased the property the sharecropping farm that he grew up on that is the american dream right that's the american dream and you're going to tell me that he grew up in the 1940s in the segregated south and did that and i'm going to act like i'm oppressed i'm supposed to go outside and act like i'm oppressed nope i'm an over privileged american it's what everybody's suffering from in america we are suffering from peace we don't know what to do with the fact that everything is okay if we just take a deep breath and get to work", "evd_uwHgXeA": "Kandice

buyer's remorse every four years later why don't we try something different guys because everything else is racist right so here's how fear politics work my name is Ashley Evans and I want the black vote all I have to do is sprinkle the word racist on anything that is opposed to my agenda ready Donald Trump racist Republicans racist leaving the Paris agreement racist Hillary Clinton not traces which is why I'm with her the Democrats have figured out that fear absolutely dominates black people politically to the point of socio-economic paralysis racism has pretty much become our bogeyman we are not I repeat not living through the civil rights era and we need to stop acting like we are America despite what CNN may tell you is not a racist country and when it was despite what CNN may tell you the Democrats were at the helm of it personally when I hear the word racism nowadays I assume it's just something that I Democrats don't want me to see and so I intentionally go pursue it but don't take it from me let's take a look at what our blind allegiance the Democratic Party has earned us in territories that they are dominating Flint Michigan not only one of the country's poorest cities but also listed recently as one of the most dangerous they don't even have clean drinking water Detroit a complete and utter urban failure and I am NOT just talking about Eminem they've got crime they've got poverty take your pick Philadelphia I feel like they win poorest major city almost every year not the greatest ability but you know Democrats of course we can't talk about poverty and crime-ridden cities without bringing up Chicago another Democratic stronghold where 75% of those murdered are black and 71% of the murderers are also black but we're not supposed to care about that right if we ask the Democrats running those cities why why we're there already 636 shootings that resulted in death this year they'll tell us look the KKK look Charlottesville look the KKK is rallying in Charlottesville where no black people died and so what do we do in response do we focus on the real issues no of course not we riot we get arrested we lose focus on what actually matters blue cities that have a democratic stronghold are absolute disasters and we can no longer afford to ignore the facts even the blue Connecticut my home state is headed down a bad path I mean apparently we looked at Chicago and got hmm that seems like a sound economic plan keep taxing the productive citizens and rewarding those that do absolutely nothing let's see how fast we can bankrupt this place the time is now for black minds to be unleashed and to revolt against the politics of fear the question we should be asking ourselves is look how much african-american communities are suffered under Democratic control what do you have to lose by trying something new absolutely nothing mr. president thank you guys so much for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "VLoc1hbwRwA": "alright guys one more talk it is Sunday so I think we have to go to church right we got to talk about God it's Sunday it's okay talk about God we're doing that again making that a thing the pastor is saying to me that I've got to do a better job and and connect with the Christian community it's been a hard journey for me as someone who was raised so Christian and then fell away from all of it during my path down liberalism I became a really bad unhappy miserable person that's what happens when you fall away from God that's what happens when you fall into yourself and you believe in narcissism and culture and and believe that life is Instagram and it's all about how many likes and clicks you can get your life becomes miserable I say that about all of these leftist rant trends take them as far as they possibly can take feminism to the umpteenth degree the women that say we don't need men we can do it by ourselves about the shave our arm page we don't have to be beautiful we don't have to be anything all right take it to the umpteenth degree where does that bring you to Chelsea Handler Kathy Griffin do they seem happy to you right nothing will let this selling brings you happiness so they don't tell you being a victim take it to the umpteenth degree where does that bring you to just see small it is you seem to be having a good month to you this is what people have to realize that they're literally selling you and peddling to you your own misery and you have to wake up from that I believe I'm standing on this stage by the grace of God by the grace of God because I did a lot of things during my teenage teenage years that I'm a gret full of it and yet still to be invited back at the moment I feel I'm an instrument of God nothing that I do is is is being and preempted by anybody but God it is his spirit that is running in me that tells you that black Americans have to wake up that America has to wake up that we have to save this country that there is an evil undercurrent happening in this nation of course we're gonna win because we're on the side of truth and we're on the side of God God you know the left doesn't like God anymore that doesn't seem like a battle they're gonna win and the person that's gonna come on the stage next and close this before we celebrate my 30th birthday it is a wonderful wonderful man who who was genuinely saved by God and his story is so beautiful I'm not I'm not gonna tell it I'm going to let him come out and talk to you about it guys please welcome to the stage David Harris jr. [Music] hello Dallas I thought they did everything bigger in Texas hello Dallas [Applause] should I tell you guys I'm moving here [Applause] I'm moving to South Fort Worth at the end of May I haven't even made that announcement yet on any of my social media channels so you guys for the first to hear it get in the heck out of California for various reasons so meet your new neighbor for those of you that are here how many people came from a long way away Houston's not that far who came really far where Fort Worth I heard somebody came from somewhere Vegas Austin Massachusetts can anybody beat Massachusetts Miami man's brother came from Miami I met Dom earlier Colorado I I'm sitting back there and I'm sitting over there and I'm listening to these speakers and I don't know about you guys all of you I don't assume for all of you but God speaks to me constantly is anybody else in here we got some believers in the house he's speaking me about today and he's been speaking me for a few weeks about today and I really don't know if every single one of you truly understand how monumental this is history books will write about this and what it's going to become they'll write about Candis and how she brought in all of us that were here and some that are not but started this bull exit movement and pioneered something that absolutely changed the direction of America I absolutely believe that you know we've heard a lot about why we shouldn't just listen to the Democrat Party and the platform you know I could tell you I spoke at the first black sit and I talked about how I almost overdosed on drugs and died and it was God that was with me in that moment in my ear that kept alive I could talk about how my wife almost wasn't here because her mom at the last minute got up off that abortion table and walked out choosing to give birth and choose life instead of fearing being a single mother and bringing a baby into this world she chose life I have two we have two amazing beautiful daughters 21 and 23 and we just celebrated 25 years of marriage I could talk about some of the things that you've already heard but I want to talk to you about what God has been speaking to me about and I call God Papa because he's a good father does anybody else in here know him as Papa know him as a good father I got to talk to you about my Papa today because as much as we're in a battle and a fight for our country I believe it's a spiritual battle I don't believe that it'll be one solely with good intentions with good understanding or good knowledge I believe it will be 1 because believers stand in the rightful place of understanding whose they are and who they carry and they go after that fight and in that fight from that position if you're not a believer in here I'm not trying to preach at you I'm just trying to be myself is that okay if you are a believer in here then you'll understand a little bit more what I'm talking about God began to speak to me about the fact that for a long time the Christian movement in this country and the conservative movement in country have been separated you guys understand that I don't think I personally haven't been to CPAC so I can't save with a hundred percent certainty but I don't know that you're gonna hear as much about God at a CPAC and this is nothing against them it's just showing the difference between the two as you've heard here today I don't know of any other movement where the leader of that movement is openly confessing her desire her need and her longing to allow God to use her in this movement and it's a political movement for far too long the political movements of today and yesterday and the Christian movements have been separated I want to tell you that I believe God is bringing those back together God is reuniting those movements because he's going to cause the believers that understand before I formed you in your mother's womb I knew you and I called you unborn babies have a destiny and it is so heartbreaking to me that so many believers vote for a party that supports ending the destiny of those babies it's even more heartbreaking when so many pastors from their pulpits will openly support a party that supports ending the destiny of those babies I believe there's an awakening coming and it must come and you know how it's going to come it's gonna come through you there's a reason every single one of you are here today not only to hear and be a part of this movement and to hear the messages that have already been shared but to hear this message and have an opportunity to respond to it I absolutely believe I personally would not be alive if it wasn't for God I wouldn't be here I literally would not be standing on this stage I don't know how many of you have an understanding and a realization and a revelation of God like that that you're not just here to live and breathe and work and be active in certain things but each of you has a destiny that was written inside of you for this time for this power for this moment in history and I believe that when you get into alignment with that understanding and revelation and then you have a heart and a passion to know God as a father not as the God that says don't do this and don't do that and do this and do that and you'll be a Christian no no when Jesus was on the cross he said Oh Abba Father Abba is an intimate form of father like we would say daddy he knew his father intimately how many of you in here is it hard for you to call your your earthly father daddy a lot of people don't have good relationships with their father and so it's hard to then try to comprehend God being good and loving you so much so that he's willing to do anything for you and he wants to actively be working in your life every day there's a scripture verse in Psalms I felt like I was supposed to read it Psalms 139 and the psalmist writes how precious are your thoughts towards me O God how vast is the sum of them he's talking about you this is a revelation that the psalmist had about our daddy how precious are your thoughts towards us Oh God how vast is the sum of them were I to count them there would be more in number than the grains of sand on the beach and then he says when I awake you're still were there with me I believe he literally fell asleep counting the Stars comparing every single star that he could count to how much his Papa was thinking about him and then he fell asleep and he when he woke up but he realized there his Papa was still sitting there thinking about him how do you guys understand that's how much your Papa God thinks about you each and every one of you he's non-stop madly in love with each of you and when you realize that and you truly step into a place where you are crying out inside to say God more than this more than that I want to know you I want to be known by you I want to be able to call you daddy I want to know you intimately I want you to work in my life I want you to move through my life I want to see you when I see somebody and I hear your heart for them and have the courage to tell them what I hear you saying about them God I want to know you and I want to be known by you can you imagine if all of us in here had that attitude if every single one of us woke up everyday excited for what Papa might do that day for who we might meet for who we might encounter I try I'm not perfect at this I try to keep this my mindset and my heart set every single day I was in DC speak in a few weeks ago and I got in the uber ride how many guys know you get into Eber and sometimes there's not a lot of conversation just not stay speaking out the language or there listen to music or they're on the phone I get in this uber and this gentleman probably mid or early 50s mid 50s he kept talking to me and I had a drive to go from Trump Tower to Dulles Airport 340 minutes and he kept talking to me kept asking me questions and I had to pause my own self and thoughts and say okay in this moment God knows we're here in the same car maybe he wants me to maybe there's something going on maybe there's something I need to pay attention to so I was praying okay papa I hear you is there something here that you want me to speak to this man or say to this man and I found out he was a believer we kept talking then I found out that he had been hit and ran over by a truck and he had no feeling in his toes he had lower back pain he had shoulder pain he couldn't put his wallet in his back pocket he just couldn't do that he couldn't raise his arm up to his shoulder it had been like that for nine months the first time I prayed for somebody and literally saw God healed him it was a man named Manuel he was about 70 years old and he couldn't raise his arm up to the shoulder he couldn't even twist his arm he tore all the ligaments in his shoulder fast forward to this car ride I'm hearing him speak and I'm like okay I think you set me up here I got faith for that I got faith period but you how many you know you pray for somebody in his ears also popped open you pray for somebody and something like that happens you really got faith for that right so I'm like okay papa I hear you so I told him I said I really think God put us in this car together because I want to pray for you and I really believed that God wants to heal you and he said okay yeah well let's pray I began to pray with him and and move his arm more than he could I prayed with him probably three or four times in the car ride to the airport by the time we got to the airport he could put his arm all the way up he could he could not only reach this back pocket but he could reach his other back pocket with his hand I prayed for his feet when we got out he said he had no feeling between his toes it was numb so I just prayed right through his boot and I wished he would have took his shoe off but I don't want to make him do that he said I feel tingling between my toes how do you know that's something right there that the world needs that we all need it has nothing to do with me I know who my papa is and I believe that he's good and I asked him daily to use me to reach other people how many of you want a greater courage to pray for people how many of you want a greater hunger to just know who you are in God how have you want to be the change and actually be aligned with how God created you and I'm talking to everybody believers are not because I know when somebody is a non-believer they don't believe there's a reason why they don't believe but if you believe you were born for a reason you were created for a reason that means there was a creator and I know my papa the creator of the universe he loves every single one of us like we were his only child that's an impossible thing absolutely impossible thing only God can do that so I believe in this movement that we're in where we've got politics we've got the Democrats that continue to attack Christianity and leave other religions alone they refer to the Christians as Easter worshipers there is an attack folks on Christianity and what I want to know is please start that music what I want to know is how many of you want more of God if you want more of God I'm gonna courage you right now to just stand up just stand up and put your hands in front of you as if God Himself was gonna give you something put your hands in front of you like you're gonna receive a gift turn it up to the top thank you God just receive just say yes this is me you say yes galaxies apart just say that sky I want more

heard God say I want you all to pray for Candice and George they are in a strategic place in position in our country to do what I believe God has been longing for for decades [Music] everything God was saying to me louder he allowed you to go through that darkness - he didn't cause those things but he using that things you never forget and they created a toughness of passionate desire that it's necessary for you to be able to handle this moment he's equipped you with every single thing that you need his son another son my brother to stand in the gap with you to be armored with you I absolutely believe atreya changed this nation I absolutely believe that you are it's already begun it's already begun but he just wants you to know that he's he loves you he's never missed in it to you he's never missed any tea every single and he's using every single tear as a beautician against [Music] so if you would just hold their hands out to receive father we just thank you so much for Georgia for Kansas God we're so faithful God we know that you have positioned them strategically you've positioned them for right now that they are breakers there's a breaker anointing on this couple

a relationship with God the Father that's the whole reason it was because he loved you if you've been walking your own path trying to do it your own way and you've been hearing God beckon you but you've been doing it your own way I want you to pray this prayer with me I want you to invite God to be the leader of your soul the master of your destiny we need to pray this prayer with me right now

decade with my amazing fiance the amazing Black Sea ambassadors who do this for free just you know these people travel the country and speak on stage and I do not pay them because I can't afford to pay them all of you guys have been a blessing I wouldn't be here without each and every one of you sharing my video is telling me that you believed in this point that it could be done buying t-shirts online I feel like the most ordinary part of an extraordinary experience and I'm trying to get through this without crying but I love you all genuinely it's been the happiest two years of my life it's been a fight but it's a fight that I feel that God has given me the strength and the position to go forth into the fire so I will end this by saying this as Brendan always says we will fight and we will win because we have the truth we have God on our side and while the left is is is being tethered down by hate and envy and greed we are being brought together with this movement with patriotism a love for our country and a love for God and at the end of the day we got love on our side thank you guys so much for being a part of this [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I can't go in the bathroom we eat mana here [Music] speech [Applause] [Applause] play catch with the honey [Music] [Music]", "jmF8njJKNzU": "but we got to work together we were not supposed to go at it alone because we're all in this together think about the history of slavery Harriet Tubman and about herself she went creeping awhile and some white folks kept her out gave her house to transport the slaves because they believed that it was wrong the whole time you were free in the north we've always worked together to succeed and I want you guys to remember that but next up is a wonderful brother I call him my brother even though we get four colors same God though I know y'all here they're the same God though but this gentleman goes all around the country insightful content interviews I think y'all know who he is help me give a great welcome to will wit allow me goes this is will wit with Prager you today we're at UCLA talking to college students and on Olvera Street talking to Hispanics in honor of Halloween and to see if my outfit is offensive did you guys like to chat with us today that's why you want to talk to you about a la find my outfit offensive you find everything do you find it offensive maybe a little you think my outfit is offensive are you Mexican no yes I think it reaffirms stereotypes offensive to people you think people really think making people are like this and carry around watches actually do you find my outfit offensive yes yeah why because it's not your culture cultural preparation what do you say that Mexican food is like cultural appropriation no someone else's culture that we've kind of taken is this cultural appropriation you don't really understand what their culture means and what it means to wear these things like the hats and the maracas you know you sort of have to understand where all of this comes from for it to not be cultural appropriation it's not yours [Music] you can I just ask you do you like my costume I like you your message hopefully this is my outfit offends you thank you do you like my costume yes does it offend you no no not me Groppo are you guys insulting me assaulting me in Spanish do you like them do you like my outfit oh it's my outfit offend you know some people get offended by what I'm wearing no no original do you know who sold me this no Mexicans really so you're white and you get offended but then Mexican people who sold me this and made me this don't get offended seems kind of weird doesn't it I love it actually I think it's offensive no some people get really offended by this why do you think that is I don't know just you're not Mexican so people think that have to be Mexican to wear that celebrating Mexico yeah that's awesome you Mexican I am see ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage will whit [Music] thank you thank you gracias gracias that's what I should be saying I haven't done one of these events in a while and so I have to start it out we're just letting you guys know again I am NOT black okay we are putting we are putting the rumors to rest I have to do it every single time I do one of these events but just want to say first of all thank you to all of you guys for being here and for standing up for the values you believe in that's that's incredible that's incredible so all of those Mexicans that you saw in that video to the left are basically token Mexicans right that's what the left would call them they all have internalized racism right the stupidest thing that I've ever heard I did a video where I went to California State University Northridge I mean Californians in here X count look perfect there you go well I don't know if Baltimore is that much better but I did a video where I went I wore a Native American headdress and a friend of mine Mike he was the black pilgrim he dressed up as a pilgrim and then we went out there for Thanksgiving and we were giving out pumpkin pie to people right and whenever you go to a school in California things never go as planned and so we started getting verbally harassed we got death threats and then eventually they ended up kicking us off campus saying how offended they were how terrible and racist I was and the black pilgrim for wearing this and then they ripped off my costume and we left is a very intense moment I'll have to say but after seeing this I was like okay I'm gonna I want to put this to the test and so I went I drove 900 miles to the Navajo Indian Reservation in Window Rock Arizona and I went I asked them what they thought about the costume and what they thought about these issues and not one of them was offended by the Washington Redskins name not one of them was offended by cultural appropriation and not one of them wanted other people to get offended for them on their behalf it is cultural appreciation not appropriation okay that's right but as you guys know if you're in college or you have kids who go to college your kids are going to college and they're coming out stupider than when they went in and that's the truth I was just there okay that's why I left people are not born offended okay if you get offended by me showing up on your campus and a sombrero and a mustache you have to be at a university okay these things are not natural you don't naturally wake up being offended this is something that has to be taught and it's because these these college students are so young and impressionable and they've never heard a different point of view they go to college and their virtue signaling academics are teaching them how terrible America is how horrible white people are and that my culture is not your damn prom dress right these are the issues that college professors teach students are going in and getting useless degrees they can't find jobs and then they come out getting offended by some white guy in a sombrero it's ridiculous so what does all this mean all these white leftists getting offended it really means the white leftists are the most racist people in America and I'm white I can say that okay can talk about my culture they think that their virtue signaling antics are helping minorities when reality it undermines them I don't know if you guys ever saw the video that ami Horowitz did I'm working with him right now actually on a documentary about how much California sucks but different story but ami did a video where he went around and talked to people you know a bunch of leftist and he asked them you know about voter ID laws and they said yeah well if they're racist because black people can't get an ID right this is what these people were saying and then he went out into the hood and he asked black people about their ideas and they're like of course I have an ID like what are you talking about you know it's like this virtue signaling this pandering that leftist want to talk about when they're talking about minorities but it's like they don't even understand the communities or the people that they're talking to it's insane it's instil of ignorance that they go off is it's maddening because they're all over everything Hollywood the media your university they're everywhere but everything that they say is wrong I like I'm saying these leftists have been completely duping people and completely brainwashed everyone a university and all young people in America and so it's I think that everyone is born a conservative though everyone has to be born a conservative and then you're taught to be a leftist so a few months ago I was in a Oberer right and I was in a suit I was in LA mind you and my uber driver she's a Hispanic woman and she's like oh like you look nice like what do you do I'm like oh I'm like a political personality you know I make political videos she's like oh my god that's so great that we have someone getting Trump out of office thank you I'm just like yeah dude for sure you know I don't usually talk politics with uber drivers about these kind of things because they find out how much Trump supporter and one wrong turn it's a one less of us out there but ended up talking to work so I was interested in I was going to a speech you know for motivation and things like that and it ended up that she was against affirmative action she was against the welfare state she believed in fathers in the homes and she was a schoolteacher when she wasn't a uber driver and she was against putting transition bathrooms into her school it was like all these ideas that she talked about we're conservative ideals we're conservative views but she hated Donald Trump and Republicans and she thought we were evil people right is that not just so insane I'm telling you that most people when you get down to it and you don't if you don't mention Trump's name in the the issues and the politics that you're talking about and they will agree with you they are just as conservative as you they just don't even know it except for those people on campus there's their lost okay a study came out that showed when Democrats talked to minorities when leftist talk to minorities they actually dumbed down their speech they pander to people you guys believe that is that not racist like think about someone like Hillary Clinton saying you know you know what's one thing you always keep in your purse Hillary Clinton hot sauce or I always keep hot sauce um but you don't write that's pandering they did the same study with conservatives and how they talk to minorities and they talk to them just like they talked to everybody else the main message that I want to get across to everyone today is that these white leftists these politicians don't care about you I know it's a sad thing to say it sucks but they're using you for their votes and for their own selfish game they champion minority struggles as their own but they know nothing about what is going on your communities or what is going on with your issues they have been using minority votes for far too long and it's time to end that but you know who does care conservatives conservatives care Donald Trump cares because they understand that when you succeed everyone succeeds conservatives are the party of America and the party of patriotism and we realize that the only way for our country to be the best is for everyone living in it to be the best as well end with this you guys heard from some amazing speakers today I'm actually before Candice I'm the last speaker and I'm the only white speaker seems a little racist to me but we won't go there but you guys have heard from some amazing speakers today learned so much and why why would you even be here today if you weren't going to go out into your communities to your friends to your family to your work to your university and tell everyone about what you've learned today and what the future of the country holds I'm going out tomorrow to shoot a video and showcase what is going on here in Baltimore showcase what is going on if anyone just after this has any recommendations for where I should go please come and tell me because I don't know the city very well but I'm bringing that up I live in California okay I live in Hollywood it's terrible it's a horrible place to live okay but California hasn't always been that way okay California had Reagan California was a conservative state and now look at it okay it's leftist policies that have made California the way that it is but it's because conservatives haven't stood up and done anything against it right conservatives have capitulated to left us for far too long and we have to change that in your college campuses they're going to be so many times when people are going to yell at you and tell you how horrible your views are and trying to shame you but you have to be that student to raise your hand and give your opinion every single time because if you're not that student no one else will be it's a chain reaction guys where I do this event and then all you guys go until one person they tell one person and that's how we can make a change that's how we can make a change but if you don't stand up and do anything against it if you are silent nothing will change and everywhere in America is going to look like Hollywood where I live and that's know not what we want at all no I think about I get a lot of the ideas that I talk about from from Dennis Prager as you know a Prager you he's my inspiration I'm gonna tell him you all clapped for him you're gonna make him very happy I get a lot of my ideas from him and we talked about the the ninth commandment you know bear no false witness and to me this means telling the truth and how important it is to tell the truth and you think about not seasoned and communist and slavers and all of these horrible atrocities that have happened have taken place because of lies right they were built on lies like slavery is built that you know black people are inferior to white people and Nazi Germany you know Jews are inferior so we want to exterminate them communism I mean the Russian newspaper was called Pravda right just truth in Russian was built on it was all built on lies and so but I can guarantee you that there were Nazis who went home to their family every night and were great people for their own for their own families they had they were loving to their wife their children they were good people in that sense but they were doing evil horrible things right so it's the same with the leftist right now in America is that they are convinced that the evil things that they are talking about that they are doing are actually good nothing", "JQDep6y9xmg": "what's up what's up North Carolina let me get some noise this is special for me because this is my home city I've been to

intended tell me about that though how hard is it to convert some people is that tough I don't have that problem the reason I don't is because I have the ability to let see it from both sides you know growing up in the hood and being the small business owner it's just about making things palatable for people so I can't go to the hood and be like forthwith and withholding said that you can't do that you got to go tell them look Trump's not a racist wise Trump not erases Opportunity Zones african-american incentives are the first step act you know and all those things that are going on that the administration is doing I'll tell you this much I personally have worked with the black guy that Trump appointed to head up the SBA's largest region shouts out to Bruce Laval so it's just really about getting the people to knowledge and the information in a way that they could take it and make it palatable that's why I like what we don't hit you need to make we need the election man we need some let come on how we need to elect you this is this guy's going places I'm telling y'all right now I'm telling y'all well good thank you for doing this let's see who else we got out here y'all let's

let's see yeah we're gonna try to sneak in your Larry week Larry we're doing a halftime show blogs a halftime show with Cantor's we want to just get a few words I mean how did it feel to be up there today well I was inarticulate I stumbled I had nothing to say it was the worst speech I ever gave it was no it was it was great all this love the fact that the message here is you are not a victim that's the primary message and it is insulting the people like my dad who grew up with real serious Jim Crow racism it's insult act as if the challenges that black people face today are the same as they were two generations ago it's an insult the idea here is work hard what he supposed so many people are trying to come to this country this land of the free home of the brave take advantage of available opportunities otherwise it's on you don't blame somebody else that's what the message here has been and it's been fantastic do you think movements like blogs that are super important to the community as a whole I mean back in the day we didn't really have some of these movements you know so how important is like blex it to the community blacks is really important because it's not about racism anymore it's not about income inequality it's not about climate change it's all about whether or not you work hard and you have the right kind of values that can become successful and that's what this is all that's what this message is all about the Democrats want you to think like victims because they want to get that 95 percent monolithic black vote how do they get 95% of the vote by telling black people you're victims you are not a victim think for yourself reason for yourself work hard and things will happen Thank You Larry great meet me again let's see who else we got going on

Larry elders and all the speakers here I'm familiar with and it's a pleasure to actually be here and to witness all the other individuals who are interested in understanding how our government works and how its broken a great wait why is black suit to you important to the black community it's important that we not be a monolith taking it for granted that we understand the issues and not base our decisions on personality or political parties or tradition but instead that we understand what the true policies of these people are and how they will affect us absolutely thank you thank you for

trying to think of baby names and time came to me and I couldn't think of any other baby names so I just stuck with it how I know he's you know he's sleeping good but how how important is it to have him here as a youth and to kind of grow up and kind of see things like this why is it important to you it's definitely important I definitely want him to make his own and form his own opinion bomb there to guide him and show him what I believe in so I think it's really important to take him things like this you know and show him the side that I believe in you know he can make his decision later maybe he'll have different opinions that's fun you know but having the right way I think you know just to show him that's fantastic that is fantastic like I would shake your hand but I know you got your hands full look look you have to but great job that's fantastic that's the best interview right there him embrace and top a first place alright let's see who else we got let's see who's around is

have a hard time right now just go without fail just come from the heart yea I think the message that I that I'm about to convey is something that needs to be said so I already kind of have I already knew what I was going to talk about but I think this message it needs to be said so you resonate with people in a way that a lot of people don't when we were walking around a couple people say King face he resonates with me why do you think that's the case a lot of people resonate with your message so much I guess because I'm normal man I ain't trying to be something that I'm not I'm not this cuz I'm a conservative that doesn't mean I have to be all uppity and you know you know you know I still talk my joint you know I you know I don't know if I care so in this but you know I'm regular man they see that I'm a wreck I'm not trying to pretend I'm not a fraud I'm not trying to look like I'm a good guy or this type of guy I think and I think that's and that's probable people relate to okay all right this is [\u00a0__\u00a0] rally you spoke up this is my second time man it's an honor man I really appreciate you know Canada so much for even giving me that opportunity especially that's why I respected the most because I know my kind of content is little raunchy is a little you know I curse a lot and I know her audience is not really too month too many of the big fans of that but I come

else there's gene that a woman at our ms Gina Gina Gina hi Gina how is it how what is this what does I know you work it too as well but do you are you a fan - like I'm still a fan of it of course before I was even hired by Candace I was a huge fan of her work and I myself was a liberal leftist I was indoctrinated in college at the age of 18 I was learning about diversity and inclusivity and racism and sexism and I was told I was oppressed especially being a woman of mixed race so from the eighteens are probably 2627 I was as I called myself a raging feminist leftist and Candace really her videos really helped turn around the way that I thought about myself the way that I thought about women the way they thought about America and so her work is so close to my heart and the fact that I'm able to be on this team and work with you and work with this incredible crew and all the speakers is just really really a dream come true it really is that's a mic drop or something I'm not gonna drop the mic but I feel I drop in a mic after that like she just gave us the story the blessed story that's what it is right there Thank You Gina we hug we Black Sea people hug we like the hug okay let's see what else we got Shekinah we got listen let me tell you something about my hyper really quickly okay before I came out you know I was a conservative before I came out with my conservative device to see her you know people like her and Charisse - somebody's names everywhere so she is a conservative who inspired so many people so talk about the impact you've had and then what blog that has had on the community to get to the specific point in my life and being able to make an impact on different people's perspective of conservatism and I grew up in a conservative household those values were instilled in me and just to even have the social media presence to even be able to come to these events and people recognize me and people are inspired it's an incredible thing and I love what LexA is doing they're gonna have a huge impact on the 2020 election and I really think that our community is starting to change and our values are starting to be put in the right place so do you have a favorite speaker that she normally because you've been to a couple of rallies that way yeah I love Larry elder I love Larry elder there's a there's not very many black intellectuals on the conservative side and I really think he's someone that has the ability to change lots of minds and I think he already has have you met him yet yes she's good y'all thank you Shekinah thank you so much all right let's see what else who else can be bobbed I want to I want to bother someone who's looking away who's looking away this lady's on her phone let's grab her how you doing how you doing we want to we were what can you tell us of your favorite speaker is Oh Candace so far and it so far okay this is your first rally okay thank I won't put the spot no more it's okay nice meeting you nice to meet you how you doing pretty good are you doing listen I need to have you around for security and all of that and that's what's up man how you doing man here's your first leg around just my first one how are you liking it so far man I like it I like it and you know I really support the movement by black conservatives I think we have to be able to be more forward-thinking a lot of things that Trump has done has been beneficial you look at the Second Chance Act I actually know men in the federal prison system who've benefited you know and we got to remember that President Clinton actually put that into place so Trump is trying to actually fix what a liberal Democrat has done also when you look at Bloomberg you know he's apologizing now for policies that he's implemented that has affected negatively black and brown men and women so you know we have these Democrats and even Biden you know Hillary Clinton with the super-predator comment you know we're so we're so caught up and I would say loving them unconditionally that we don't even think that there's another avenue that we could go to get a beneficial things passed for our community so I think that's why I'm voting for Trump in 2020 you know and I always tell people around me we got a support like we can't keep continuing to put all our eggs in one basket and just saying we're gonna vote blue no matter who that's idiotic that's crazy and I don't even know who came up with that statement but it's it's do you think movements like blogs that help like make it easier to have those conversations because obviously it's tough to sometimes share those facts because some people don't listen right so do you think organizations like blogs it help you kind of facilitate those conversations with people most definite definitely and I and just look at this president Trump listens to a lot of look at look you might say what you can say whatever you want to about Kanye but when him when he came and he started talking about prison reform and he started talking about things and Kim Kardashian came Trump listen listen and he said you know what I'm gonna help the community this is what you need let's do a look at HBCUs we have been crying forever about funding for HBCUs President Trump came and said listen I work with the people in Congress and we're gonna pass this he did that so why are we still mad and keep continuing the car if he was a racist he wouldn't do nothing for a black education cuz he'd be like ok I don't want them to do anything because I'm a racist so you can't continue to just call somebody a racist who saying okay I'm gonna give black men and women a chance to come out of prison and to help themselves I'm gonna give black people who go into HBCUs a better shot at higher education how you gonna call a man a racist and he's implementing policies that say different so we got to start thinking movements like blech sit and for some people that think it's putting the Democrats on the rope and we got to keep pushing hard because we gotta wake the people up man you are on it I can tell you a research this man is sharp he is research okay we thank you we thank you it's or the rest is oh man let's see what else there we let's see what else we had huh where's the wife right there next to the guy in the red shirt in the red hat where she at she's right there her name is humble humble okay so about this yellow humble yellow humble y'all is there a humble here humble how are you Pierre good to meet you so your husband said we should interview you how do you feel about that but for the spy you must feel like you got some knowledge this here Riley yes how are you liking so far everyone's really nice have you gotten a chance to like talk to Larry elder yet right yeah he's very passionate and he makes his conversations personal his seems like a really good guy he knows how to connect right I can tell ya have you met any other speakers King phase will wit I've listened to a few of Canada's Owens's debates but that's pretty much it my husband is really big on politics and when I started dating him when we got married I got I started to get interested - so your husband's the one who kind of like got you into the pile okay so he told us that you are the political guru he told us you're the political guru I feel like anyone who reads the Bible and follows the Bible you know has the right has the right stance on life and has the right stance on how to treat people I tried to trick her up y'all she's too good he never told me that I don't want you to go home pillow talking with him like he told me he didn't tell me that but then you came back with a good response she's good y'all but that's like that was a great response you're right about that thank you for taking time with me I appreciate it I would love to get out the North Carolina State Director is in the building y'all the blogs at North Carolina State director can I get your autograph please how amazing is it to have this Riley in your own state the state where you guys are working so hard already on the ground how amazing is it to look around no these are your people I know what's awesome is that we sold it out and now we have people that are just as invested as we are and kind of like calibrating our vote and taking back our community and fighting for our values and stopping the liberal bullying so I'm so excited this is all us here and the energy is real in here right now tell us what you're doing you got a clipboard what do you what do you don't just put more well is I'm so excited people have been giving us their information they want to be a part of what we're doing and we're happy to get them down and kind of keep them tied into what we're doing thank you so much Danielle

halftime of every show let's stay with us for the whole show but we have a great second half coming take care [Music] [Music]", "78nNJyE3yc4": "what is a positive black tv show where the families are together there are none right now we have love and hip hop people that are aspiring to make it in the hip hop industry uh people that want to be rappers people that have baby daddies that is they're actually via the media resetting our goals the majority of people want to be like lebron james that's why it's very easy for the media they understand they can control minds to give a better cap to lebron to give a hashtag i'm with her shirt to beyonce and that means what we're all supposed to do whatever they say culture has taken over and it's harming us hurting all of us especially america in this moment because you turn on cnn and they tell you that white people you guys you two shouldn't even be sitting together right now he wants to kill you according to cnn right right exactly that white people and black people cannot come together everybody should be afraid because the evil white man is out to get us america is not a racist country our media is making us think", "yO-Wq0NwDRc": "the narrative's cracking patrice colors got three million dollars in homes separately these other three people they bought is just now a six million dollar house that's nine million dollars there was some house that was announced in canada that she bought for her girlfriend okay that's totally around let's call that 12 million dollars here's the here's the best part you're not done finding out this is nothing okay black lives matter announced that they raised over 90 million dollars okay they were funded they were bust all of this stuff was paid for by white democratic operatives right where's the rest of the money", "s2U6SzW3NHk": "hello everybody today we are doing 10 fun facts about me that you probably don't know let's jump right into it number one i have three siblings i feel like everyone's always super surprised to learn that i have siblings i guess i must give them only child syndrome vibes but actually i'm middle child ish i guess you can't really be in the middle of this four i have an older brother and i have an older sister and i have a younger sister so me and my sisters are only a year and a half apart so he grew up just crazy fighting and we're super close actually a fun story a little fun side anecdote is that my sister who is older and could not be more different from me um was in one of her corporate classes they had this like special george floyd function thing going on um and they wanted all of the african-americans to be able to have time to vent and to deal with each other and talk to each other about their feelings and one of the other black colleagues started benting about candace owens [Laughter] the time my george floyd video had gone viral and my sister was like the leader of this course so um awkward [Laughter] number two i went on tour with wyclef jean i was about 18 years old met him through somebody else who was working for him somehow ended up in canada he was on tour with lil wayne and sean paul and it was kind of a random experience that happened when i was on break from college and then i saw him later in life again so i actually good friends with wyclef john i like why clap he's a great guy number three this is kind of embarrassing i learned to crack an egg at 32 years old actually two weeks ago uh i that is not me i don't cook i actually love to cook but for whatever reason the egg cracking thing to me is a science i'm still not that great i always get shells in it so then i have to like individually scoop the shells out so i found it just easier i just asked someone to crack the eggs i asked my husband or ask my assistant to crack eggs um but i'm getting better because i watched youtube video and that's kind of embarrassing but i'm gonna share that with you anyways number four i was born with a blocked tear duct so when people ask why i have no feelings it's because i wasn't able to cry for the first couple of weeks of my life number five i can suddenly taste cilantro i went my whole life without being able to taste it you know cilantro is a very polarizing vegetable some people can taste it and it tastes like soap and other people have no idea what they're talking about woke up at 26 years old went to buy a taco from chipotle suddenly tasted cilantro and it literally tastes like soap duds fascinating vegetable honestly you should feel bad for me tomorrow you might be able to taste it too number six i have always loved to travel the world i think we're all super ignorant unless we make ourselves uncomfortable and see what else the world has to offer so when i was about 23 years old i up and moved to costa rica with a family that spoke no english and which was obviously a total immersion and then i took classes for eight hours a day there was no english taught in the classes they felt that the best way for you to learn was to actually need the word so if you wanted food you had to learn how to say comeda definitely very rusty but i understand spanish so don't think you're gonna talk trash about me and i'm not gonna know what you're saying number seven this is random i get super angry if i'm forced to hold my bladder i just find it really arbitrary like if you're on a car ride or with your parents you're looking at the bathroom they're like let's wait ten exits i'm like nope nope that's a completely ridiculous thing to ask somebody to wait to hold their bladder just pull off just pull off the exit so don't ask me to hold my bladder i think it is like one of the things that parents do that they need to stop doing i get it you don't want to stop all the time but i just get very angry when people ask me to hold my bladder like oh could you just do this no i have to use the bathroom let me go to the bathroom shout out to all the pregnant women in the world who have to go through that that's even worse number eight this is just a weird moral position i don't go to zoos actually kind of goes back to me going to costa rica it was really bizarre to be there they banned zoos a while ago and the animals aren't afraid of humans so i was in manuel antonio uh costa rica and like the monkeys will come up to you and the deer which i grew up in connecticut there's so many deer they're terrified of human beings they'll just stay there next to you and walk next to you and it sort of made me realize that something was weird about zoos and animals being afraid of us so i don't go to zoos i just don't really i think of it as like a prison for animals and i always think to myself okay imagine if an alien civilization had zoos and they just had different types of human beings and on their alien planet they're like oh yeah that's a chinese one oh that's an american one and they just people just went around with their alien kids and just looked at human beings behind glass we would look so sad number nine speaking of animals i absolutely hate bunnies i think they're the children of satan and they've been able to get away with it because there was this huge propaganda campaign with bugs bunny and everyone thought he was cute he's actually not that cute if you ever actually look at a bunny at night time their eyes are like red it's totally creepy they freak me out i think that they're i don't know i just think that they're guarding the underworld and that pr campaign has people confused bugs bunny don't fall for it bunnies are satanic and number 10 i would like to reinforce but i really really really hate bunnies that's it guys hope you enjoyed that do not ever gift me or my son or any of my future children with rabbits", "v0MT9-2cEDw": "the second song amazing grace and i'm i'm gonna tell you why i love that song first and foremost um i walked down the aisle to amazing grace when i got married um and the song is always i never knew the history of the song it's just a song that when you hear it um it does something to you you feel it there's something about amazing grace that you feel and so i thought to myself let me actually look up this song amazing grace where does it come from where does this hymn come from the story of amazing grace is it was it was written by a man named john newton he was a british man and he didn't grow up with any uh theological basis he had no religious convictions in his youth um he was sent to the royal navy he was forced to go there in that in that time and for after a few years he switched lifestyles and he joined um the african slave trade he used his ship and his vessel uh to transport slaves from africa um and in 1748 there was a storm at sea off the coast of ireland uh which he did not think he was going to survive and he reached out and he said god uh please have mercy on me have mercy on me and he survived six years later he gave up seafaring altogether and he decided to dedicate his life to christian theological studies and he was ordained in the church of england and uh he began writing hymns and he wrote amazing grace he actually wrote it as a a song that was supposed to go with the new year's day sermon and the song actually didn't pick up in britain it didn't pick up it never became popular until years later it did pick up in america it picked up an america in the south um when religion there was a revival of protestant religion in the south and it also picked up amongst the slaves suddenly the slaves began singing this hymn as they would work amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me and you can when you listen to slaves um sing hymns when you listen to the heart and the soul um that was behind them singing in the hymns it's an incredible incredible experience to really process people that were in this horrendous position singing this hymn that was written by somebody who had a spiritual awakening about savior about grace and about god and i think the reason that the song means so much to me and i think to every single person why you instantly want to sing along is um because we're all the wretched right that saved a wretch like me that that is exactly how i feel the blessing that i feel every single day that i get to stand on stage and i get to have not just a second chance a third chance a fourth chance a fifth chance because i was a wretch right i made terrible decisions when i was young king face talked about the decisions he made when he was young brandon talked about him being arrested brendan tatum right all of us led these paths were down these paths um that were so meaningless and so harmful and so hateful and then we were saved i was saved simply by conservative principles right that is the chance that god gave me conservative principles go back to your root figure out who you are right and i realized that while i was living my life liberal while i was going around thinking that i was free because i was following no rules right liberalism and leftism there are no rules in life you should do and say and be whatever you want to be and not be respectful to other people don't acknowledge truths you can live in lies because being you can lie and lie and lie that's a form of freedom and i lived that way i lived that way for 20 some years until that thing that was supposed to feel like freedom started to feel like bondage i realized nothing in my life was real nothing that i had was tangible or real not my relationships not my friendships nothing was real because we were all building ourselves upon a lie a foundational lie when i lost my grandmother in 2013 that was the beginning of a turning point for me my grandmother was really the only mother that i knew and she raised all of us in the way that grandparents are able to raise it seems like everyone in the family cousins brothers sisters we all felt that we were raised by my grandmother and my grandfather and when my grandmother was taken into the hospital in 2013 they thought she'd be out in 48 hours but i got on a plane anyway and i went down to fayetteville north carolina to see her i had this big expensive bag i had just started working in private equity and as soon as i got a check even though i was some 100 thousand dollars in student loan debt i went and bought a fancy bag so i could fit in and look cool and my grandmother she must have known that she wasn't going to make it out of the hospital because she she took time to speak to me and each of my siblings and all of my cousins individually and the last word she said to me the first thing she said to me was candace you need to forgive your mother so random we weren't talking about my mother we weren't talking about my upbringing i had a tough one and then she said i worry about you i worry about you in new york city i worry about you because you're losing yourself and i laughed it off and i said grandma it's fine i got on a plane in 24 hours she was dead so it was an incredibly it was a moment for me because i suddenly started thinking about my grandmother and reflecting upon the upbringing and reflecting upon the ways that they had raised me the things that i had run from growing up in my grandfather's home there were nothing but rules we had to be sitting around the table reading the bible before we head to school he would ask us questions he would not serve us a plate in the morning he would ignore us if we didn't say good morning it was just a sign of respect you don't come down here you don't sit down and ask for food until you greet the person that is serving you and you say good morning he ran a tight ship and that ship was filled with love a lot of rules but more love and it shaped me and my sisters when we were young he planted the seeds of conservatism that i would be able to harvest later my grandmother and my and my grandfather believed in the family structure my grandmother grew up in tortola british virgin island she had a lot of issues health-wise and she was because she was considered crippled because she walked a little funny she was treated horribly had a horrible upbringing a horrible life my grandfather grew up in a segregated south um and so he had to work from the time he was five years old laying out tobacco to dry in fayetteville north carolina uh picking cotton in fayetteville north carolina five years old wrap your head around that five years old getting up before the crack of dawn otherwise the carolina sun is too hot so you have to get up and you have to do man work right at 5 00 a.m in the morning crack of dawn and my grandfather did it he never complained and what was remarkable is uh never once in our household when he would share the stories of his upbringing never once so my grandmother would share the stories of their upbringing did they ever complain it was just what happened my grandfather despite surviving attacks from the ku klux klan never once in our household said a bad word about white people it never happened right my grandfather would just say it was a different time in fact regarding the ku klux klan he talks about that story with such tremendous pride he says the kkk would come around and spray bullets in our home and my daddy would grab the shotgun and shoot back at them boys right boys calling me these these terrorist boys right that strength um that victor mentality uh that my grandparents had never complaining it's so special it's so special it's the same victory mentality when you look just a few generations ago and you look at the boys whose average age was 22 years old that left their home country to go land on the beaches of normandy right look at the images of those boys in world war ii the courage watch the documentaries about the conversations that were had they knew they were going to die they were they they were they were 20 20 years old uh people that were 18 flying and doing all of these things pilots that knew they didn't have fuel that were flying towards mit towards midway and knew that if they made a decision to turn around they weren't going to make it back the courage the strength the way that these people fought and the way that these people lived the principles that they had the values that they had those are the things that made america great that made america unique if we can go back if we can go back to understanding that our strength and our values are naturally conservative because let me tell you guys something in times of a real struggle and strife everybody's a conservative it is only it is only in remarkable times of privilege right when you are so privileged and your life is so great do you have time to debate bathroom signs and whether or not they're accepting enough right only in times of of real strife everybody becomes a conservative because conservative is about sensibility it is the only way that we are going to move forward as a country if we all come together if we all come together and we we adapt and we realize that conservatism is what built this country if we realize that every single person in this room is connected based on the fact that you were born and you are here in america america is by far in my opinion the greatest country in the world and i will tell you why because what unites america is a philosophy and that philosophy is that if you work hard like my grandparents did and you stay out of trouble and you make good decisions this country will reward you it is that simple", "cgV7ScwDrZM": "where did you get all your which i mean it's obviously questions probably asked thousands of times it wouldn't cover boring one where did you get where'd you get your start my start in what journalism or whatever journalism what would you what would you classify yourself as yeah i mean i'm ver i do a lot of stuff so it's it's kind of hard because i mean i i write obviously i'm an author and i create content but i also you know do a lot of interviews i do a lot of news hits so it's a lot and i i mean i best the best place that i got my like the like the answer to that is on youtube is kind of if you're talking about just like my public profile i started making youtube videos in 2017. um and i was doing skits actually i was just doing like skits kind of mocking i feel like that's kind of when politics got hysterical like you know what i mean like it prior to when i was in college republicans democrats are just like friends it was totally fine to like not talk about politics and then it was suddenly not fine and people got very hysterical especially after like the trump um win and i started making skits kind of mocking that and i think it was my third or fourth video that went trending worldwide it got like 26 million views were some of the who are some of the influential that came came at you for your views and your i mean lebron came out you didn't need cardi b came at you lebron never came after me i actually usually go after lebron because i think it's important for him um with the platform that he has and i think that to be clear lebron is a well-meaning person i don't think lebron means to do bad i just don't think he's that smart i really do i think lebron james is low iq why do you say that though because i've i've heard him speak about issues and he just is he's so wrong but i think he carries with him an arrogance which isn't hard when you're being called a king right and he's an incredible talent there's no doubt about that he's incredible talent it's it's very hard to level yourself and to say okay i can be really talented but also not be educated about something right and um if you are not educated about something you shouldn't speak on it i try to do very good about that if i don't know something i try to listen you know i usually talk 95 percent of the podcast by the way can i say talk 95 percent of every podcast i am [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is all you this is all you can do but would you rather it's a good way to be and i've done that before when people are talking about something i'll say actually i don't know anything about this and i'm just going to listen and i think for lebron would you rather be quiet though i would rather yeah i would rather him be quiet than tell his people that follow him a lie yeah 100 percent it's better to be quiet than to be honest i think it's a lie right that but that's what i'm saying so i think for him he needs to do the work of actually becoming educated about these issues and it's not hard it really isn't hard to actually look up data and to look up the facts i mean with a man with his kind of money he doesn't even really have to look up at that in fact someone could send him a short list of the bullet points and say hey here's what's actually going on in american society but um yeah i think so lebron james frustrates me because he has such a big platform and he has the power to do so much good i always say he's just he's not a kobe i don't know i don't explain i love i absolutely loved kobe and i think kobe was extremely educated and he just wasn't someone that the media could play but kobe didn't voice his opinion as much as lebron there might be a reason for that yeah what about what about what about the cardi b thing cardi b came at you for something um i'm sorry you went to cardi b or how to work um cardi b and i have been in several spats um so you don't like cardi b is that funny to you at all that like you and cardi b are going i know i'm like in these rap battles i actually have to drop like a mixtape i think nikki slaps harder than cardi yeah yeah i think nikki's great and nicki's um i love them both yeah what did carter say to you i don't even remember how it started i think i mean cardi is she's it's incredible how uneducated she is i mean we got she just got embarrassed on twitter she was just saying stuff about politics and i was just responding i wasn't being rude i was just like she literally doesn't even know what country she's in how the country works you know she's hardly you know when when she types there's 87 typos and basic words and yet same thing she's mouthing off and saying things about and she she literally doesn't understand like i don't even think she understands like congress has a senate and a house of representatives i mean she has no idea what you're talking about and the thing about carney that's upsetting is that i watched her on love and hip-hop um my cousin was super into that show and she was at my house and i started watching it with her and before cardi blew up you knew she was going to be a star she was very likable and she was likable because she sort of she she was shameless like she knew exactly who she was exactly what she wasn't and she didn't really care you know what i mean it was like whatever i'm gonna make it i'm gonna be big i have bad teeth this is where she got teeth done and she was very funny and entertaining and enjoyable and then something happened when she became bigger yeah that she got bitter you know and people started telling her like carter you gotta care about posix polly no you literally don't car you would you would you ever a fighter in like a trailer boxing event or anything like candace owen versus cardi b like i would do that oh would you really yeah yeah actually time out there i don't know celebrities i haven't really seen either but uh fighting-wise but i think that would be like the main event headline they should do cardi b versus candice like 100 what about what about you in aoc though um what do you mean she would never do it she doesn't she doesn't even respond to anything that i say because it's hard like her whole thing is like any time anybody says anything to her she's like you want to have sex with me yeah can we work like you're racist is your goal is your goal to tweet yourself like what kind of response is it was just ridiculous she does this all the time if anybody critiques her she just says either her three things are like you're a racist republican can i read it or like you wanna like basically you wanna have sex with me like you're you're you're fetishizing about me it's like nobody in the political realm should be said so the whole thing was that she always complains about masks and then she went to a state with a non-masterpiece particularly she complains about their policies in florida and desantis so it's like all right why are you there why are you there fair critique right i mean totally fair critique and she just came back with some ridiculous if republicans are mad they can't date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend's feet you creepy weirdos and then she did another tweet where she said like it's so obvious that you're obsessed with me because you're sexually frustrated it was just like this is not how adults speak you know what i mean you're an elected member of congress this is just not how adults speak respond to the critique and or don't respond but don't pretend

definitely suffering from the breakdown of the family when I say that liberal policies Inspire that what I mean to say is that via the welfare system we are quite literally seeing the incentivization

watching my vlog series mrs. Bethune so let's peel back the layers of this onion for most what's being lb or G has anything to do with being t ready circle the sentence that doesn't belong hey I like cats P I like dogs see I like both cats and dogs ee I think like a cat but I look like a dog the answer obviously is the no disrespect to the transgender community but forcing people that are lesbian gay or bisexual which is really just a preference in terms of who you like has absolutely nothing to do with a disorder between your physical and mental is quite literally what being transgender means right your mental and your physical is out of order the issues that those communities face have absolutely nothing to do with one another it's just liberals trying to create this process of groupthink trying to tell gays and lesbians and bisexual people if they don't stand up and defend something that's absolutely nothing to do with them they are somehow risking their own communities right could not be more  regarding Donald Trump's announcement I agree transitioning individuals to not being in the Army the Army is quite literally a group individuals that needs to be completely focused on missions that are ahead of them I cannot think of anybody's emotional capabilities that are more unstable than somebody that is transitioning from a male to a female my only person that watched int the military is not really a camp that you go to to figure out who you are also completely disagree with the idea that people should be allowed to go to the military to have their medical expenses covered most especially when those medical expenses are as heavy as those that are absorbed by transitioning male or female they have therapy that they must conceive before they are even allowed gender assignment then there's obviously the actual surgery that takes place I think it's a slippery slope I think once one person figures out that you can join the military for a couple of years and someone will pay for your entire surgery and a big group of people will soon follow and at some point taxpayers will quite literally be paying for people to go to the military like at the camps that you go to to transition I 1010 percent support the transgender community not in this capacity forget whether or not somebody identifies as male or female to enlist in the army period they do a very tough screening of your physical capabilities you cannot listen the army if you are disabled and there is a reason for that they are trying to put a stop to people just enlisting to get their disabilities paid for and I'm not saying by any means that being transgendered is a disability but I am saying that it does absorb high medical costs that said I think if somebody has to be transitioned I have absolutely no issue with them joining the army I sat in between process that makes me a little bit uncomfortable most especially think about the ripple effects within the barracks if you are a male and you are a female it's very easy to say usually if you sleep there you know these are sort of your teammate if we're talking about you're a male but you think you're a female you're a female you think that you're a male pretty sweet how does it affect someone you're sleeping next to you or showering next to you by the way a huge argument that I see being circled around is about human rights you should know that in the military they don't have rights they are told when they have to wake up when they have to go to bed what they have to eat how much they are allowed to eat the military is not great it's a very structured and focused environment and that is for a reason this is one issue that liberals need to pull back on this is about the defense of our country one argument that I saw being circulated on Facebook was hey we paid a lot for our military we spent over a billion dollars on a ship yeah because that ship is literally going to go out and defend us how do you even correlate these two ideas people in the army serve us not the other way around I again just want to stress I completely 100% support the Trinity I do think that it is something that people feel inside of them that is real that said I draw a lined in the sand when it comes whether or not my tax dollars should go to supporting to put it mildly if you wouldn't support me getting a boob job in the military because I think I'm Pamela Anderson few wooden support Rachel thousands of getting her skin color tinted because she thinks she's african-american then you should not support our tax dollars going to individuals that

Rob Smith I think Democrats use identity politics to keep people in line to keep black people in line to keep Latinos in line to keep gay people in line I'm black and gay and I've seen them use the same tactics for black people as they do for gay people the media is drunk on the president they are drunk on Donald Trump anything that they can possibly say to make this administration appear negative or racist or anything like that they go for it Don Lemon went from an anchor at CNN to the chief overseer on the Democratic plantation what they're doing is they're trying to send a message to any other black Americans to any other black conservative that supports the president that this is what we will do to you if you are vocal about that support what we hear every day from people who don't support the president that he you know get support from white supremacist white nationalists etc you I was in a room full of hundreds of young black conservatives that did support the president for you to call it a minstrel show you were doing what every other black person is doing right now to anybody who dares to expound the sermonette you did you just did it and Kanye West talks about a lot of different things he talks about the relationship between black people in the police he talked about basically supporting the president he talked about making America great I've lost friends since coming out as a Republican bill do not understand it and these are the the left that's supposed to be so tolerant and so inclusive you know and these are the people that were the first to shun me when I came out as conservative who you we have actually so you go okay well you were just insulting what he's calling it was voting for the same party for decades and having nothing to show work what you want to do is you want to make it so controversial for any black person to have anything to do with this administration have Trump derangement syndrome and I think it is terminal I think that they want to push out anything better make it up about this person because they know it gets question I will tell you and I will tell you Trish if I thought for a single solitary moment that the president of United States hated me for being black or hated me for being gay because I am beau I would never have gone to that event I never would have gone to that lecture well please welcome to the stage Rob Smith [Applause] hello now we are all here today because we know that black people don't have to be Democrats now I'm gonna let you in on a little secret gays and lesbians don't have to be Democrats all right now it took me a long time to kind of figure that out I'm going to tell you what I knew that as a gay man I didn't have to be a Democrat when a terrorist walked into post Orlando and killed 49 gays and lesbians in 2016 now I was very far on the left at that point I thought that the people on the left were supposed to protect me because Democrats were allies and and they were friends through the LGBT community I'm a gay guy I thought that they were going to be there for me what I did not hear from them was anything other than silence or other than making excuses what I heard from the Republican Party was that this was an act of terrorism and we are not going to take this for gays and lesbians in America you see this is the thing about being a gay man in America we have our rights gays and lesbians have all rights gays and lesbians that live in America right now are the luckiest people in the LGBT community on earth because the last time I checked gays were being thrown off rooftops and Saudi Arabia not Atlanta all right and the last time that I checked it was Iran that was forcing transgender surgery on gay men just because they wanted to criminalize being gay all right now the Democrats right now let me give you a little secret let me cue you in until with the Democrat tea movement right now right they see just the way they see black people just the way they see Latinos they see it as another permanent victim group that they can own in perpetuity and I'm here to tell you as a gay man as a black man as a black gay man that I don't have to be a Democrat that I am a proud conservative now let me tell you the way that that the Democrats in the far left have have hijacked this LGBT movement is anybody fan of Kevin Hart Kevin Hart comedian funny guy little guy very very funny I'm a big fan of Kevin Hart huge fan of Kevin Hart now a couple about 10 years ago made a couple of tweets um couple gay jokes he said oh if my kid was gay you know I beat him I'd do that uh-huh we told him hey Kevin you know ten years ago that's not cool because I'm gay and lesbian kids still kill themselves not cool he said okay I'm not gonna do it anymore I'm gonna take it out of my act I'm not going to do that anymore I'm gonna make the female lead of my last movie Tiffany Haddish tonight school she was a lesbian right and all of it went away but as soon as Kevin Hart got chosen spiit Oscars it all comes back again right so you hear about what a homophobe Kevin Hart is and so he says hey I apologize for that in the past I don't want to apologize again then he goes on Ellen and then he apologizes again and again and again and he says I apologize for before and I'm gonna apologize again and then he goes on a whole media tour for the new movie and he apologizes again and again and again and let me tell you something he only needed to apologize to me the first time because I know hey when you want allies in any community that you have to give the space for growth you have to leave the space for improvement and if we're not giving that to people if we're not giving that to celebrities if we're not giving that to other people then who does that what does that say about who we are as a country now I'm gonna tell you this the LGBT movement talks a lot about tolerance and a lot about acceptance and a lot about inclusivity they don't want your tolerance or your accepting Oh your inclusivity they want your submission all right what they want is the power over you so that if you ask questions about anything that's going on you're called transphobic or homophobic or this or that they do the same thing to me and I am a gay man I have issues with 10 year old drag queens I think it's strange all right I have issues with 10 year old drag queens I have issues with so many things that are going on right now and what the LGBT movement does is they attack attack attack and when I talk to Candace and I was like well you know should I do a speech about has the LGBT movement been hijacked well hell yeah it's been hijacked it's been hijacked by people who don't leave space for growth and space for improvement and I will say one more thing that and this is personal for me because come coming out as a conservative and getting involved in all of this movement in this community has brought me closer to God okay it is brought in has brought me closer to who I am is a Christian and when I see a hashtag like exposed Christian schools trending because of where the vice president's wife decides to teach for a couple of hours a week and so this is supposed to expose expose Christian pools and I think about this as a Christian as somebody who loves Jesus and I know Jesus loves me all right so and I know that there are some people that are very deeply religious and they may have something to say about me being gay and that's okay but there's nobody that that is of this earth that is going to tell me that God doesn't love me when I say all this to save the left in schools hey Mike no all right we're gonna do this here it's all good y'all can hear me off philomene so the thing about it is is that when you deal with the full G beats he left when politics replaces the religion in a community then politics is their religion that's I it's easy for them to come for Christian school so when I talk to Candace is she invited me to do this and I thank her for that and and she wanted me to talk about the gay thing and I said well you know Candace why do you want me to talk about the gay thing because I'm black and I want to talk about that and I want to do that but then I realized that we talked about the black thing and I talked about the gay thing and we talked about the Latino stuff in that stuff and all of that stuff so we can get to the American stuff the America stuff is the good stuff and we are all Americans this country has done so much for me I served in five years [Applause] so went to Iraq went to Kuwait did a lot of that stuff and what this country has given me I can't even put into words how much is given to me it's given to me so much and so what I'm here to do today is what we need to do with gays and lesbians who don't have to be Democrats is we need to invite them into the America movement because the America movement is what this is all about the America movement says no matter if I'm gay or straight I'm a part of America USA [Applause] yo the America movement says that regardless of my sexual orientation I'm a part of America the America movement says regardless is the color of my skin I'm a part of America the America movement says no matter what we are united and bound together as Americans all right that's the movement I want to be a part of that is the movement I want more blacks to be a part of that is the movement that I am right here inviting gays and lesbians to be a part of has the LGBT movement been hijacked hell yeah it is too low too far left edit and let's invite gays and lesbians and everybody else into the America movement because that's movement I believe in thank you so much [Applause] [Music]", "x943qTbD2P0": "ladies and gentlemen without further ado please give a big welcome to your black Sikh founder and final speaker Candace [Music] absolutely packed in here this is amazing have you guys been enjoying yourselves yeah you're learning a little bit right are you feeling inspired right you know I had this conversation which I kind of wanted to reiterate I was talking to my husband and he put up the perfect love that a great analogy he said the left is like the Titanic I want you to think about that for a second right a bunch of liberals got on board right and said not even God can sink this ship right not even God can sink this ship all in the ocean everybody's it's amazing the media's on their side this ship is amazing it's never gonna go down and then they hit a little iceberg and they said aw it's alright just a little iceberg it's the Titanic not even God can sink the Titanic it's a little iceberg and he likened that to one day when they hit me in the media right oh it's alright we'll get rid of her right she was she was a little loud but we'll get rid of her will smear her will say she supports Hitler will say she hates herself will say she's a self-hating black it's fine we'll get rid of her it's just a little iceberg but that was just the tip of the iceberg see I was just the tip what was buried beneath was olive Black's it it was 60 years of injustice done to the minority community in America and now they're panicking because they realize you have a problem and you know what they didn't put enough lifeboats on the Titanic they don't really know what's gonna happen to the left anymore but liberals don't know what to think because suddenly black Americans are waking up and ordaining to think for themselves [Applause] the challenge I have always presented I have never gotten on a stage and told people who to vote for what to vote for why they should vote because I don't consider blex it to be a political organization or not we are an organization that focuses on free thinking the ability to say what you think in the ability to describe to somebody why you think it's that's the most important part not just thinking something but knowing why you think it why why is such an important question I ask people all the time why do you fight why do you get up why did you show up and come to blex it today what is driving you and the actions that you do day in and day out I know what drives me I tell people all the time the story and it's I'm actually just floored that I get to say it on this stage tonight it's gonna be extra special but you know for me running around the nation and speaking on college campuses has been something like a nightmare it's basically just rooms full of toddlers people crying over privileged telling me that they're oppressed when they live in the greatest nation if you live in America today you are the most over privileged people that have ever lived in the face of human history that is the truth okay and so I used to I play this game all right the first thing I do when I get at college campus as I say before we get started because you know I got tons of protesters there usually I have black lives matter in the back just waiting for me to say something at one of it at UCLA they actually had a group of people that were playing Beyonce music music trying to drown out the sound to my voice couldn't be heard you have an teef outside making physical threats so I start at the beginning I say before we get started building up yell at each other I'm gonna ask a very simple question in this room okay it's 2019 in America how am i need college students in this room this is what I ask think that America is a more racist country today than it was in the 1940s 60% of the hands go up 60% why are you sending your kids to school seriously 60% of the hands off I say you got to be kidding me that is brainwash right there that is meaning a brainwashing at work and what drives me is that because that's what makes me angry so many of you guys have followed me since the beginning since my red pill black days right YouTube when I realized that something was wrong I decided to start a YouTube channel I didn't know where it was gonna go I didn't know that people were gonna find me and start sharing my videos but I knew something was really rotten and I wanted to present a different perspective because what seemed to happen to the black family seemed to be systemic in the 1960s they came around and they started offering welfare right knocking on doors you need some welfare for your family government help let me tell you something the bigger government gets the smaller the individual gets okay government is trying to replace family you have a problem they don't want you to go to God they want you to go to government right we have a solution the experiment was black America he experiments when LBJ created the Great Society Act was black America we're gonna give them a little something just a little bit of something right not much they're not gonna get ahead but he'll keep them coming back it created addicts I call this government addicts addicted to government I don't know anybody who has stayed on welfare and gotten ahead in their life because it wasn't built to help them get ahead of their lives it was built to help them get addicted to government it is a drug okay and they knew what they were doing because here's here's the plan once you break down the family right you know what's gonna happen to the youth when you don't have mom and dad at home around a table telling you what's right and what's wrong where's the youth gonna go they're gonna pursue that paternity somewhere else they're gonna run to the streets suddenly hip-hop artists become mom and dad Beyonce and jay-z become mom and dad right you put on a record and you're learning something right the angry hip-hop writers are telling you how you should live your life and that's what happens and then they cease can trol the education system and they started brainwashing because they know the single mom she had to be at work right so it's okay schools free drop off your kid at school the public school system is free fight for the free school system and what happens you end up with a bunch of brain washed children who believe they're victims before they even try to get out they're bitter and they're angry at the world before they even try to attempt to make something of themselves this is a systemic oppression that exists today our education system and the systemic breakdown of family in the nineteen in the 1960s there was a guy named Patrick Moynihan used to come out with a report in the 1960s he came up with the report on single mothers and he said oh my goodness we have a problem in the black community the single motherhood rate in the 1960s was 23% he said this is an epidemic 23 percent single motherhood rate in the black community and they all said oh this is an epidemic today as we stand and sit in this room the single motherhood rate in the black community is 74 percent you want to know why atheism is becoming mainstream why you see people mocking people I mean I was floored to see on the view Joy Behar boo mocking mocking the vice president because he's believes in Jesus Christ right because he said that he doesn't go out to eat with another woman without his wife she was mocking his values it's become mainstream and popular and Curren to mock God why because you have to be the government needs a theism that's what they want they don't want you to believe in anything they don't want you to believe in family they don't want you to believe in God they don't want you to believe in anything but government and that's what we're trying to reverse that's what we have to reverse if we're gonna fix the issues in our community I tell people all the time that I was lucky I don't know which way I was gonna end up I was a liberal you guys know I started on the left in the same way but I was fortunate that in my formative years I grew up in my grandfather's house in my grandmother's house and it was you know a little different my grandfather grew up when there was actually real racism in America right not just oh you offended me and my feelings so I'm gonna call you a racist I disagree with you so you're a racist right real racism he grew up in a segregated south his first job was when he was five years old laying tobacco out to dry on a sharecropping farm this is what it was in the south in North Carolina in Fayetteville one of twelve brothers and sisters but he got up every single day and he went to work there was no nonsense he's picked cotton before there was no nonsense he grew up with the real KKK right not I don't like the president so we're gonna say the KKK is back and now pocketbook can't go outside the real KKK and even when he tells us those stories when he tells us the stories of what it was like with the KKK he never sounds like a victim it's exactly how I used to say he used to say my my daddy the KKK used to come around our house and my daddy would grab the shotgun and shoot back at them boys talk about that power there was no victimhood and the amazing thing is he married my grandmother when she was set when she they were 17 years old came up north married my grandmother and never once in their households did my grandfather say anything bad about white people I I wasn't raised to view myself as less than I simply never learned how to be a victim that's the way things were that wasn't the society that I grew up in instead and this is this is shocking Mike my grandparents believed in some other stuff really crazy stuff I'll tell you first and foremost they believed in God right faith something bigger than themselves when I was growing up we used to have these big my grandpa's to fix big southern breakfast says I should be overweight you see grits eggs makin pancakes hot chocolate every single morning around the table and we'd have to read from the Bible me and my brothers and sisters we'd have to read from the Bible every single morning he'd go around and he'd ask us questions we were on our best behavior I was a scared because as a child I believed that through my grandfather's praying he had an instant direct line to God and when we would act up he would incorporate us into the prayer and I always tell this story and he might not remember it but one night I was I was cold so I got up another night and I turned the heat up in our room we had up my start bunk beds and you weren't supposed to play with the heat in granddad's house but I played with the heat and couldn't read it but we woke up and it was very hot and I went down for breakfast and and you know I said good morning because if we didn't say good morning he wouldn't serve us our plate you couldn't get food so you sit around everybody else got a plate you couldn't get your food if you didn't say good morning but I was I said good morning I was ready for my plate granddad broke out into prayer and he won't believe what he did he said dear Heavenly Father please help Candace to realize she shouldn't be finishing with the heat I got up from the table and I ran and I started crying and I just said why did you have to tell god I can't between the family yeah but tell God that fear that fear right of my grandfather's rules and knowing that there was something bigger that was watching me that had to put me on my best behavior in the end that's what that's what saved me but not in the beginning because when I went to school I was embarrassed about that it wasn't cool to be a person that said oh I just you know we read the Bible this morning you don't say that in school you don't say that in secular America it's not cool to read the Bible in the morning it's not cool to talk about praying and I went down a very liberal route I say this all the time I took the most liberal route to conservatism there ever was I was embarrassed of how faithful my grandparents were all of that embarrassed me but by the grace of God I was saved I really was because those things that felt like freedom going out sneaking out doing what you wanted to do partying drinking right experimenting all of that thing that felt like freedom eventually it started to feel like bondage it started to feel like bondage what is it about liberalism it's so free that you feel you feel like you're being enslaved somehow right you look up and you have nothing you don't believe in family you don't believe in faith because Yolo you're free well what do you have to show for anything if you don't have a family intact my grandfather's a happy story because when he retired him and my grandmother moved back down south to Fayetteville North Carolina where he started and he purchased the property the sharecropping farm that he grew up on that is the American dream right that's the American dream and you're gonna tell me that he grew up in the 1940s in the segregated south and did that and I'm gonna act like I'm oppressed I'm supposed to go outside and act like I'm oppressed nope I'm an over privileged American it's what everybody's suffering from in America we are suffering from peace we don't know what to do with the fact that everything is okay if we just take a deep breath and get to work I was super upset many of you guys know that I got married in August I get to start my own family now and give them the same rules my grandfather gave me and incorporate my children someday children into the prayer and scare them and at my wedding my grandfather was supposed to walk me down the aisle and a couple of days before he had dialysis treatment and he couldn't make it and I was devastated on the day of my wedding so I haven't seen him since my wedding but he's here tonight my grandfather stand up granddaddy you guys be careful before he starts praying and gets it all you guys are gonna be in trouble I still don't put my elbows on the table when I eat I want you to know that granddad I'm good but we thought to end this flexor rally since the movement is really about courage and love and my grandfather couldn't be there and no one has seen it we would play the video from my wedding so my grandfather can see what it was so cue the wedding video [Applause] [Music] we're on this mission in life to find peace with exactly who and what we are to take pride in our thoughts talents and flaws and to stop this incessant worry that we can't be loved as we are by the grace of God my life's mission is complete because of George Farmer it will forever be okay that's something that Candace Rhodes for me and I would say because you Candace they will forever be okay [Music] so Candace without you you've changed my world darling you have made me a more generous person more thankful more kind more caring but under who I agree with are you to be honest I look at our lives in the last eight months since we met and I look at the things

Donald Trump is a racist he is one of the worst races that every is where he introduced it in Congress where the HBCU schools would definitely get money the opportunity zone the Auto portability act if he's a racist you don't know which way is he is going he has done more in the first three years that I can remember that any president has ever done and Candace Owens I watched her and I saw her coming I said you know I'm pretty good at starpower and look I'd say that's a star and I said man I don't want to mess with her she stopped she's tough now I'm not allowed to say it you know that I'm not allowed to say it anymore but she's also beautiful so I'll say that business first and he believes that if you get a strong economy blacks would be a part of the economy I don't believe she singles out any race but he is a he is a businessman and he wants to bring everybody up the same pace there's a matter of fact when I was talking to some people today and they say yeah go Trump go truck there are a lot of people especially black people who really see the benefits of supporting the Republican Party and diamond truck [Music]", "xvsdMVG8kA4": "you know what we've started here and and this is why we finished with with the promised land because this is why we keep fighting right people say how do you get up out of bed and take the hits that you take i mean i've been accused literally i woke up one morning and i was accused of a mosque shooting in new zealand did you guys follow that i mean it was the most ridiculous i'm like i speak about black america i speak about minority america refusing the lies of a left i get up on stage and i basically say the same thing every time i say black america i believe in you i believe in us hey hispanic america minority america asian america i believe in you i believe in us that's it that message is considered dangerous so dangerous that they are willing to put out a media hit against me anybody that can take candace owens down there will be a prize the headlines i have read about myself they call me a black white supremacist and anybody see white supremacy here tonight i mean the stupidity that it takes to come up with something like black white supremacy oh yes please i would like to help create a society that i can't live in that would be the logic i get up on every stage and i say please please please oppress me that would be the logic and yet we have pockets of people that fall for it we have pockets of people that are still believing the media lies we have pockets of people that don't realize that the media do you want to know what they're after a civil war when i turn on cnn and msnbc and i watch what they are saying and the lies that they are spinning they are after a civil war what do you think they want when they say things like candace owens is a nazi sympathizer like candace owens hates black america that candace owens is inspiring mass shootings what are they doing they are giving permission for people to come attack me that is what they are doing they are saying to antifa you can show up where she is and you can do what you do and you can threaten her you we are giving you the permission and our hands are going to be clean that is what they are doing it is a sin and it is wrong and they have gotten away for it for too long people ask me all the time what is blexit what is blexit candace what is it right it's blacks it's latinos it's asians it's also white people white people too waking up we are all waking up to the left we are waking up to what they've done and it's not just a wake up guys it's an education it's a re-education look at our schools in baltimore not being able to find a single child that could pass a literacy exam across five schools why are they doing that because they know the truth an educated mind can't be enslaved so i have to make sure that we remain uneducated they like their minorities emotional and reactive and not logical and rational and so the challenge that i ask all of you minorities here today is when you see a story on any headline and it makes you feel something stop right there and think first think first in 2016 i had to do that because i was hurt just like you heard brennan talk i was hurt when i watched who every person in this room felt something when we watched people bleeding out in cars because of a police officer we all felt something because we're human beings and we have a heart and the color of the person never mattered that was in the car it never mattered but then i stopped and i said why why just before an election cycle or all of these liberal networks only showing this why are they showing black versus white why are they showing police brutality what is this i looked at the statistics and i said my goodness as a as a black person i have a higher chance of being struck by lightning than being struck by a police officer unarmed why are they showing this because they want us angry because they want us emotional because they want us irrational because when you are emotional you are able to be manipulated and you are able to be controlled i have watched the media create an entirely different candace owens it's amazing it's amazing i've i've googled myself and i said oh this girl sounds horrible i'm a protestor and i said to myself it's incredible they make me sound like i grew up like a privileged rich girl in connecticut no i didn't i didn't grow up as a privileged rich girl in connecticut i grew up my living in an apartment with my two sisters sharing a room where we had to have an exterminator come every month for roaches they say they know what people think when you hear connecticut right that's what they do candice grew up in connecticut where the median income is a hundred thousand dollars they're not commenting on my family they just want to make you think that i grew up and i've been out of touch with black america they don't want you to know what i lived through they don't want you to know that i grew up with uncles in prison and i visited my uncle in prison when i was a small child they don't want you to know that i made a conscious decision when i was a child to live a different life i was the little girl and this is what blexit is for the little girls that are wondering if there's something else that are living in existence and saying i don't want this for myself i always tell the story to people of my first play date and it's an important one i will never never ever forget this and it's stunning how when something is so important in your life your brain just locks it in there like it was yesterday i was five years old when i had my first playdate i didn't go to preschool so my whole existence was where we lived in this low-income housing housing structure in stanford connecticut i didn't know anything outside of it everything i saw every day was black people and hispanic people and then i went to school and my first friend her name was lindsey and she invited me over for a playdate and i was so excited to go and when we got to her house i was shocked as we were driving that the houses just got bigger and bigger and bigger i said oh my goodness do people live like this i went i went into lindsay's house and and she had this beautiful big white house in sanford connecticut and and she had a nanny and everything was perfect in her house she had a playdate extra space in the basement that was converted in into a playroom for her and her sisters everything in her room was seemed to me like it was it was victorian style she had glass dolls and i said my goodness i can't believe people live like this i want that in that moment i decided that i wanted that i wasn't bitter i wasn't jealous i wanted to know how i could become that how i could live like that and then you know what happened they put me in the school system after kindergarten you start learning and and the teachers what are they teaching people actively well the reason lindsay lives like that and you live like this is because of the color of your skin right that's where they start the programming this is this was liberal candice i was learning actively to to think that white people had something against me this is what the public school system when you have to understand the uphill climb that we have the public school system is teaching us that we are oppressed that we it's because of the color of our skin they're not telling us that we are the authors of our own destiny that were in the driver's seat that we have to make different decisions they didn't want to say to me hey candace you know if you wanted to live a different life your mother could have made some different decisions my mother dropped out of high school my mother grew up in and out of group homes coming out of her life she was one of nine children right those are different decisions that could have been made my mother had all of her children out of wedlock these are different decisions we don't learn about that in school how do we start teaching people that they are the authors that they are in the driver's seats of their own destiny i was blessed and i really do believe this i was blessed in 2016. and i never tell people who they support as candidates so please go out do your own research i'm just telling you my story i was blessed in 2016 and 2015 actually when donald trump came down the escalator and i'll tell you why i was blessed he came to an escalator and i was a liberal i didn't know much about politics but i knew that i had to be a democrat because of the color of my skin i knew that right i knew i was on the left because of the color of my skin and he came down the escalator and my first thought was oh no not him is that the guy that says you fired president of the united states absolutely not absolutely not but then more importantly than the things that i was thinking were the things that i wasn't thinking you see i was thinking okay you know he's a reality tv star he should he shouldn't be president of the united states he says you're fired that's too gimmicky that's making our country a joke no way but i wasn't thinking this man is a racist but the media suddenly exploded and they said he's a racist he's a sexist he's a misogynist at one point if you guys remember this they were saying that he was incestuous and he had feelings for his daughter ivanka you guys remember that's it was absolutely disgusting overnight but you see i grew up listening to hip-hop music and until that man announced that he was running for president united states everybody loved trump okay everybody loved trump and just like that the media said no no no no no no forget everything we said i know he was great he had his own show we loved him forget beyonce and jay-z sipping poolside they wanted to be at mar-a-lago remember in the songs everybody wanted to be at mar-a-lago he was a symbol of wealth of americanism that you had made it everybody loved trump and just like that i was supposed to be convinced that he was a racist because he announced his bid for the white house that was my aha moment i still wasn't sure wasn't sure about him but i said to myself and i asked a very important question it's a question that i want you guys to ask yourselves is it possible that racism is now being used as a theme to turn black people into single issue voters the answer is yes when people know what you are afraid of they can control you okay when people know what you fear they can control you and the left has figured out that minorities fear racism so they call everything racist i mean i actually saw an article i believe it was the washington post and it said that air was racist and i thought it was a joke i was like this has to be satire i clicked it it wasn't they said that we are breathing worse air than white people it was amazing i said wow we're here right now okay air is racist i didn't think okay and the day it is laughable but you know there are people that are sharing those articles going see i told you i told you i had a feeling the air is racist i've been i've been completely killed by the press a thousand times over for a lot of things first and foremost i am not a feminist and i say that proudly and i'll explain to you why please do not believe that people that are calling themselves feminist today these modern feminists these lena dunham types that are out there boycotting brett kavanaugh are feminists they are not they are people they are radicalized feminists people that are operating under the guise of feminism to attack men okay a society cannot thrive without strong men okay they are trying to demote masculinity you see this in our society there's something wrong if you have any type of a feeling that makes you feel like a man there's something wrong with you they're trying to pervert masculinity they're trying to even pervert femininity there's something wrong if you're a woman and you want to raise your kids oh my goodness what is wrong with you there is nothing wrong with raising your kids in fact i would argue that's the toughest job in the world to raise good human beings this is the left this is the left you have a feeling like you want to get married what's wrong with you i mean i had a feminist tweet at me and said why don't you go make your husband a sandwich okay did he does he want one i mean why on earth would i have an issue with making my husband a sandwich modern feminism is just it's so crazy wackadoodle i can't even begin but this is the stuff that is required learning in school now when i was at university i was required to take feminism 101 okay as a part of my prerequisites for a journalism major let me tell you i'm going to show you guys all how my class went you guys ready you guys are now all in feminism 101. we had a massive textbook in this textbook was every single problem that has faced women since the beginning of dawn since the time of dinosaurs they created this textbook okay our teacher would sit at the front and she'd pluck out one of these things that happened in the textbook she'd say oh um pick up pick a struggle uh women are tired more tired than men why and she turned to the class i mean all we had to do to get an a was say because of men that was it i mean it was it was really the easiest class you could possibly get an a in and no other thinking so she'd say um i i lost my keys this morning why a's this everybody just that was incredible that was incredible how fast you guys learn so i remember being in this class and mind you this is at a time when i was a liberal i was on the left it was fired up feminism sounds great feminism 101 let's do it but eventually i said oh i just everything is just because of men i feel like there's got to be a little bit more going on and there's one particular class that i always tell people about and i will never forget it because retrospectively it was a turning point for me she plucked out one of her things from this textbook this wonderful textbook every promised beginning of time and it was a statistic scary statistic said 89 percent of the people in this country that have an eating disorder are women she turns her classroom and she said why goodness einstein's in here it's just incredible and everyone in the class was you know these people had some of people had picked the class and they're nodding and she went on and she said it's because men make us feel like we have to be skinny and they're controlling the advertising industry and i put my hand up and i said oh this one i'm just gonna have to try to rebut a little bit and she looked at me because we'd do this back and forth and she was like ah candace what what could you possibly have wrong with what i just said i said professor i just i just feel like there might be something else going on i don't think everything can be because of men and and she looked at me and i'll never forget the words she uttered to me she said you know candace i just feel like you were sent to me from the men's department i'll never forget what i said back to her i said you know professor i just feel like i was sent to you from the common sense department there might be something else going on that requires a little more critical thinking than men and we kept trading back and forth and we kept going and and eventually i i hit her with a bomb i said you know i actually have an eating disorder many of you that follow my story know and and a lot of this is in my book as well that from the age of 18 to 22 i had anorexia so here i was sitting in her classroom and rather than turning around and asking us really genuinely ladies why do you think we have this problem she was telling me why i had this problem and she was wrong there was never an eating disorder because of men there was something men ever said to me my eating disorder wasn't even about being skinny it was a control mechanism when i felt that things in my childhood were out of my control i said this is something i can control i can control how much i eat and i became obsessed with it because it gave me control and it gave me power that was what it was about had nothing to do with men the idea of men even calling other women fat is i mean that's exclusively a girl on girl crime and here i am you know i'm right you know i'm right guys you'd be like oh she's thick girl's like she's fat she's fat in that moment fellas like thank you thank you but you know in that moment and i look back and that moment was so critical it was so critical because what i was watching was liberalism versus conservatism you see liberals when they have a problem they look externally they say who can i blame who can i blame if i'm poor i can blame rich people if i have an issue and i'm black i can blame white people if i'm skinny i can blame fat people right you know this uh what's it called body positivity movement right right yeah i'm blaming skinny people for the fact that i don't like my fat right this is what the left is all about it's the opposite game give them enough time it'll be the short versus the tall right but conservatism is something different it's something that i believe in you see when we have a problem we look internally we say how can i fix it how did i get here what can i do to change my destiny how can i correct this course that is conservatism i always say that that moment and and that challenge that was presented to me when trump came down the escalator which spiraled and led me here was a god-given moment and i will tell you what it is that that he's taught me that i think has been the greatest blessing of my life he taught me for the first time ever how to love the american flag how to love this country right he taught me how to love the red white and blue something that you don't learn in school you learn in school how to hate america you should feel guilty about being american while everyone else is suffering we should feel guilty about capitalism we should give it all away we're horrible people trump made me realize that there is so much beauty and patriotism because do you know what patriotism does not know color patriotism does not care about your sex patriotism does not care about your gender patriotism cares about your ideas america is united by a concept about an idea and that idea is that you can come from nothing you can come from absolutely nothing in this country but if you work hard and stay out of trouble this country will reward you that is the american dream there is no person that has lived that dream greater or more more to the truth than my idol my everyday inspiration my mentor my best friend my grandad my grandfather uh er is um he's about 80 now and he was born on a in the segregated south in fayetteville north carolina on a sharecropping farm so his first job was laying out tobacco to dry and he was five years old five years old that was his first job he'd get up before the crack of dawn because otherwise it was too hot under the carolina heat and he'd have to pick cotton and lay out tobacco to dry never ever ever in my life did my grandfather ever tell me that i couldn't do something because of the color of my skin i've never heard my grandfather make a negative comment and i grew up in his house during my formative years about white people ever he just believed in hard work he just believed in god he just believed in family he also believed in lectures every single morning we'd have to we'd have to read the bible around the table and he'd ask us to he'd read a scripture we have to learn something from it he'd make these big southern breakfasts he had weird rules too like no elbows on the table and if we if we broke the rules he'd always incorporate us into a prayer which was horrible because i was young and i thought he was telling god on me so he'd say dear god please help candace realize that she shouldn't you know she shouldn't be turning the heat on in the middle of the night and i go and then i start crying and i say why are you telling god then i'd run from the table and run upstairs and i look back on that now it was stuff that used to embarrass me when i was a kid so you know i went i was a part of the secular world i went to school it wasn't cool to talk about god it wasn't cool to say oh this morning we read scriptures i just wanted to fit in i was so embarrassed of that upbringing when i was young i look back now and i just i genuinely thank god i thank god for my grandparents i thank god for those breakfasts because they've now provided um a pillar in my life and i will end this by telling you where granddad is now granddad after moving up north marrying my grandmother when he was 17 years old he stayed married to her until his dying day 53 years later in 2013 and when he retired he moved back to fayetteville north carolina and he purchased that sharecropping farm that he grew up in that is the american dream that i am giving back to our community i am giving back to our community that we can work hard and we deserve a piece of that dream after all of that time", "h5IKPLQB2Gg": "i was about to head to dinner but i decided to hop on my live because i saw i know i'm about three hours late that 50 cent basically just posted on his instagram and twitter a couple of hours ago um that he's voting for trump and the reasons why quick little screenshot he put of the tax rates that are going up in various states and what it would look like under joe biden rather um which is something like 60 in new york 62 percent in california i mean these numbers are insane you've never seen them i really quickly want to just uh say something to defend 50 cent because i am just seeing so much ignorance in his comments um from majority of black people saying they're done with him and it's because he's rich and he's betrayed them no it's because he's smart and you're not okay and i'm going to explain to you now what you don't understand about what he's saying because tax cuts are not for the rich and this is what is this is what happens this lack of understanding is what happens when a school system gets washed of actual education so instead of learning about uh taxes and about tax revenue and tax rates and how it works you guys are learning about black lives matter and white privilege and um why you should be sad because you're black and how it hurts and here's your safe space none of you are learning anything you have no idea what you're talking about you are really just give yourselves an old school no fives okay if you actually believe that joe biden is only gonna raise taxes for people that are making more than four hundred thousand dollars because what it shows is that you you you have to be extremely ignorant about economics okay just extremely ignore economics so first and foremost there's a packet that i want you to read an essay by thomas soul called um trickle down economics and tax cuts for the rich i have it somewhere behind me i'm gonna grab it in a second so you can go read it and understand what tax cuts for the rich actually means because it's the only thing that actually helps poor people with their taxes poor people pay less taxes okay when rich people pay less taxes let me explain to you how that works okay so 50 cent is saying i'm not paying these taxes rich people all over different states that are hiking taxes right now are saying i'm not paying taxes now when they say that they're not saying that bluffing they're literally moving picking up and leaving the state so let's just walk through a common sense scenario for you let's say the state decides that it needs to tack it needs to collect a total of let's make it an easy number 100 000 in taxes in the state of california okay and let's say that state keeps raising and raising taxes on rich people and rich people finally say you know what i'm leaving the state right so if you think that you're gonna just tax rich people 90 percent and they're going to stay in the state you're an idiot rich people are the ones who can afford to leave the state okay so let's say california right now for example the daily wire they employ 75 people ben shapiro they pay massive amounts of tax in california what happened california taxes got too high and they just announced that they're leaving and moving to nashville that means they're not going to be the one paying that figure figurative that i just made up a hundred and thousand dollars in tax revenues that the government needs to um collect right same for joe rogan joe rogan had enough of california he moved to texas where there is no income tax tennessee nashville there is no income tax so which people have the option to pick up their entire families and companies and leave okay so they've reached the point of no return same for charles schwab a billionaire right lived in california forever his whole life all of that money your attack you're actually collecting from a billionaire in your state california got out of hand so what did charles schwab do he picked up uh schwab corporation and he moved it to texas where there was no income tax right that's the end of that story elon musk saying he's picking up and leaving tesla because of because of taxes and covert 19 restrictions that's the end of that story so what happens when a government okay because you you guys need to understand this when a government taxes rich people so much that they all leave do you think the government then turns to the poor people and says well it looks like all the poor people are gone so we're just gonna have no more taxes i guess no you fools that's not what happens what happens is the government then turns to poor people and raises their taxes i'm not making up this scenario it's happened in america multiple times you can read about it actually happening in times like the like the great depression when they raise taxes to an unbelievable rate right rich people will always hide their money they can hide it legally by the way i'm not talking about fake ways to hide it they can invest in municipalities there are bonds that they can invest in right to build parks they can hide their money for five years and get it for five years and the tax rate is more favorable these are legal these are sanctioned by the government and of course they're gonna do that i i would certainly if i was living in a state that was taxing like crazy looking to putting my putting my money in some sort of a bond system which would make sure that i didn't have to pay taxes on it for a while and could let it sit and mature right you guys don't understand that because you're so emotional that all you hear is tax cuts for the rich now tax cuts for the rich what happens under that scenario look it up it's happened historically okay when the government lowers taxes for rich people and rich people go oh wow that's actually a very low great tax rate they're happy to pay the majority of the taxes that's what happens there's a reason so you know what state is going to be thumbs up in a couple of years it is thumbs up now texas for all the rich people are moving they're gonna you're gonna see their economy boom the neighborhoods boom and they're gonna be happy to absorb and pay the majority of taxes you know what happens in that scenario when rich people are given a tax cut so are poor people it's not an either or it's both because rich people are happy again to pay all of the taxes the majority i'm talking about and it has happened historically read this pamphlet that i am talking to you guys about okay it literally spells out to you what is going on why it was good for poor people when trump announced a tax cut because then it de-incentivizes rich people to hide their money from the government if they're okay paying it when i keep saying hi again i'm not talking about a criminal criminal hiding there are legal ways that you can hold your money so that you don't have to pay taxes you can move different states they can move different countries poor people can't do that poor people can't wake up one day and go you know what let's move to nashville this tax rate's too high you know let's just let's just get up and go to texas this tax rate is too high poor people are stuck because the government has to collect its revenues so what joe biden is proposing if you just understood this entire video is something that is going to hurt poor people because rich people are going to leave so you just saw 50 cents say i've had enough with that right these are the people that i'm talking about he's already paying for the majority of you people who don't understand that that they're already paying for the majority of you now you've pushed him past a point of no return so he's voting with his brain if you're upset because he's not emotional and he understands how this system works and he's not going to be an idiot and let joe biden say you're already paying the majority taxes but you have to pay more the problem isn't 50 cent it's you because you're not learning anything in school because you have to come on to instagram because you think you hate canis owens because you don't understand economics and tax revenue and tax rates okay i don't really care how you feel about me i really don't i'm not here to be your friend really never never been like i really hope everybody wants to be my friend i really don't i want to be smart i want to be smart and i want to be successful so i study this stuff so i read these books on economics so i can understand why it works this way this is the reason they're dumbing down the school system because they love everybody to be emotional especially minorities look 50 cent 50 cent betrayals look at him he betrayed us because he's rich no he didn't portray you the school system betrayed you the school system failed you the fact that you don't know this and you're coming to my instagram to learn it that is how what's what's failed you be upset that they're talking about removing more academics and they keep wanna we're gonna teach race sensitivity tell them to teach you economics okay so you understand this you don't let somebody slick talk you like joe biden into accepting higher tax rates because that's going to happen in all of your states if he wins that's what's going to happen across the entire country if he wins the rich people are going to move the rich people are going to hide their money and poor people are going to be stuck paying it the end", "7Bl_LSa4sJA": "colin kaepernick named the GQ citizen of the year and this is supposed to represent a win for black people the last time I mistook skin complexion for progress I called him Barack Obama my name is Candace Owens and you are watching my new vlog series the declaration citizen of the year because he bravely knelt down during the national anthem man the definition of bravery has really shifted over the last few decades and quite frankly I'm embarrassed let's take it back to 1944 shall we when the Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy during d-day the average age of the men on the front line were between 18 and 20 years old their chances of survival during the first hour were one in two yep a 50% chance that they were going to die a bloody and gruesome death on a beach far from home fast-forward to 2017 and a 30 year old grown man who is being paid millions cannot stomach standing for the national anthem which is meant to honor those children who died on those beaches to add insult to injury that grown man is now being honored with citizen of the year Colin Kaepernick you are a coward in my book and when the dust from a storm of ignorant settles you will be remembered as one for those of you not made privy Colin Kaepernick's Twitter feed has become something akin to the longest-running episode of toddlers and tiaras ever if you thought it was just the national anthem that he was throwing a tantrum about here's a recap of everything else that makes Colin emotional number one the fourth of July Colin couldn't bear the idea of fireworks and hotdogs so he went to Africa to find his true independence number two Thanksgiving because Colin couldn't stand the idea of Turkey and family he travelled to find a Native American tribe during the sunrise number three is me taking bets as to where he'll travel for Christmas Day I'm thinking Israel or the North Pole to see Santa the only thing brave about Colin Kaepernick is his girlfriend because I had to deal with a toddler man feeling emotionally reduced by every holiday no dodge some fireworks cap eat some stuffing and please for the love of baby Jesus and everything that is fun about his birthday do not ruin Christmas then of course there's the controversies surrounding Meek Mill a rapper who after for probation violations and a stern warning from the judge was issued prison time not one not two not three but four probation violations and of course Colin Kaepernick came rushing to his aid in another ill-advised tweet captive like us know that he spoke to Meek Mill and he will continue to fight against the harsh sentencing practices and affected meek and millions of other people of color for generations breaking the law is illegal the consequence of doing something that is illegal is getting arrested Meek Mill is in prison because he broke the law continuously not because he's black highlight of my week was jay-z chiming in in support of Meek Mill talking about the in Justice's of prison sentencing not the same jay-z that tried to get Hillary super-predator Clinton back into the White House yep that jay-z you mean the jay-z who's married to the woman that threw a concert to put Bill Clinton back in the White House yup that jay-z's wife you mean the same Bill Clinton who locked up more black people than any president in the history of the United States that berkland oh but you mean to tell me that we're meant to protest against harsh prison sentencing when rich rappers go to prison for doing illegal crimes but we're supposed to vote for the people that created those sentences if you're a fool yes huh Colin you are a citizen of the year to no one the Democratic globalist and their media cohorts who work overtime to make sure black people say on the cycle of nonsense the same media that refuses to talk about the actual issues facing the black community and I gotta tell you it's not police brutality 16 unarmed black men were fatally shot by police in 2016 six teen meanwhile apart from Italy 1876 black babies are born in every single day in the United States meanwhile 762 black Americans were slaughtered in Chicago alone hmm if the highest priority is preserving black lives you'd think to hear a lot more about those stats more police officers are fatally shot by black men every year we lost 16 black men and 147 police officers in 2016 interestingly enough in New York City black men make up more than 75% of all shootings and yet only represent 23% of the population and so the question remains why are black people disproportionately committing crimes in this country we represent 15% of the population in the largest counties and yet we make up 57% of the murders in them 45% of all assaults if you're anything like Colin Kaepernick you would say that those facts are racist and come up with no solutions or answers but if you were smarter than him then you would induce that there is a direct correlation between crime rates and poverty how does the black community solve poverty is the answer a kneeling during the national anthem is the answer be doing everything that jay-z and Beyonce say we should do is the answer C protesting and rioting or is the answer D none of the above Colin's protest is garbage it's a distraction from the conversations that we should be having as a community it's similar to having a black president in office for eight years and seeing absolutely no change or progress but ignore me I'm acting white intelligence makes me an Uncle Tom like larry elder or thomas owl in fact let's keep encouraging black people to boycott and get arrested and sever any and all professional aspects that they may have all in the name of real blackness look if your column cap jay-z or the number one black extortionist al Sharpton I want you to know that black people are waking up it's only a matter of time until we all figure every single one of these things out I know I certainly have and I have no intentions of shutting up thank you guys so much for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "5L5Jd8ZNMkw": "[Applause] I'm gonna have our first white person out here so I I the people on the right we mean the better we're winning the internet war I really do think we are everything's in my turn my go onto my computer I go onto Instagram or Facebook and I find funny memes they're coming from the right and the left giving us a lot of content to laugh at there's one account in particular who is familiar with DC Drano this recently found out he has a real name his name is not first name DC last name Drano so I'm going to let him come out here and speak to you guys all about what's really going on in Trump era please welcome to the stage my dear friend Rogan Oh handily yes I'm so sorry we actually have a video to show that's totally my bad spring everyone DC drainer here so in my last video of me walking through Hollywood with my Maggie had I wanted to send a message that we the people are reclaiming our streets from leftist political thugs like auntie fun a video did pretty well but I kept reading in the comments of oh you only walked through Hollywood why don't you try walking through Compton and see what happens Compton it's a pretty bad rap most people wouldn't ride from here without a Bible a prayer and a bulletproof vest [Music] well let's do it today I'm gonna be walking through Compton with my mag a hat I'm not bringing any weapons or any protective gear it's just me my camera and a damn important message that I want to send to mainstream media Hollywood celebrities and these corrupt political leaders that's it again please welcome to the stage broken Oh Madeline wait bring it I thank you all I bet a lot of you were thinking man why would you do that why would anyone do that you are crazy and you would have something in common with my mother she was pretty upset when she found out but I said mom listen this is your fault and she's like but I said mom I watched you when I was growing up you raised three kids by yourself for many years you didn't have a college degree he worked three jobs waitressing washing toilets cleaning houses and she taught me when I was growing up that rogen it's not about talking the talk it's about walking the walk and so that's what I did and some of you might think you know oh you did it to to troll the libs or to provoke an attack and you know go viral but it's none of that I'm a Republican I'm a trump supporter and I believe so strongly that President Trump is going to be the best thing to happen to the black community since Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves from the Democrats in the 1860s I recorded that video back in September of 2017 this was before Candace Owens was Candace Owens this was just something I really wanted to do I have for years thought that you know black Americans are getting screwed over by Democrat policies and I felt like Donald Trump is the guy that's gonna turn that around you know and in that video when I finished walking for those of you haven't seen it on YouTube spoiler alert I survived I was scared out of my mind don't get me wrong I was really scared but I wanted people to click on that video and I wanted them to watch it and I wanted them to see just how strongly I believed in the speech I gave at the end which was that Donald Trump's policies of reducing illegal immigration of building the wall of reversing these horrible trade deals that sent middle-class jobs overseas under clinton of taking people out of prisons and putting them back in their homes where they belong with their families and getting a second chance i knew that those things were going to happen and you know what i was right and now here's what else I'm gonna say I was right then and I'm right and I believe I'm right with these predictions I'm about to make I think that Donald Trump is going to take America into a new age of economic prosperity for all Americans no matter whether you're black white asian Hispanic everyone I think that we're gonna start seeing higher high school graduation rates in our inner cities I think that we're gonna start seeing family units strengthened I believe that mothers and fathers in Baltimore Detroit and Chicago are going to now be able to send their kids to school without worrying that they're going to be shocked it's gonna take time but we are going to do it and all of you here should take that message that courage that I had build it up within yourself and support this president because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get this right and we owe it to all those people that are crying over their slain family members to actually step up and help save these inner-city communities that have been lied to for decades by the Democrat Party and I just want you all to note that this isn't your grandfather's Republican Party okay this is this is different we the people have taken over this isn't a party led by George Bush or Mitt Romney or John McCain or Paul Ryan or any of those globalist sellouts this is a party led by Donald Trump Candace Owens charlie kirk and dan Crenshaw this is a party that is listening to all of you and is going to actually fix what Democrats have been breaking for decades so I hope that all of you look at what I did I'm no one special I was a lawyer in Hollywood doing deals with Harvey Weinstein crazily enough don't worry he didn't do anything to me but I was working in Hollywood for years and I was working my my ass off to be honest and I was tired of working 60 to 80 hours a week and taking home a little more than 60% of my money and driving on roads that would break my suspension and hearing about how in the schools the public schools they barely spoke English I would drive by them and they looked like prisons and then these people in California would look at me and say you're the bad guy you're a white male you're working you're paying taxes screw you and give us your guns so I had enough I had enough I had enough of supporting this rising socialist system in California and I had enough to keep in my mouth shut I worked in an industry where if you say you are not a full-blown Marxist you will be blacklisted you will be fired when I made that video I was making a couple hundred thousand dollars a year pretty cushy job if they saw that video I'd have a pink slip sitting on my desk and a lot of people I talk to you say you know Rogan I'm worried I'm gonna lose my job I'm I'm worried my friends are gonna not like me if I come out as a public trump supporter and I just tell them listen at what point in your life are you gonna finally stand up for what you believe in at what point are you going to say across this line you shall not pass I stand firm in defending the Constitution and defending the flag and supporting Americans of all races across this country and that's that was it that was me saying I had enough and I started posting on Instagram posting memes and quit my job they offered me partnership on the way out a competitor law firm brought me to lunch and they said Rogan what's it going to take for you to come work for me and I said well probably a lot of money but to be honest I think I'm moving to Florida and she says what are you gonna do and I said well I've got an idea I don't really want to share it yet but and she says how about this five hundred thousand dollars a year and I'll make you partner and I said can I think about it but I knew deep down it wasn't gonna matter she could have offered me a million I just couldn't take it anymore I couldn't take where this country was going I couldn't take how Communists are calm Californians are treated I couldn't stand how Trump was being treated I think we need to defend freedom of speech and so I packed up my crap sold my house moved out to Florida and now I'm doing what I love and talking to all you and so to everyone out here I hope that you all voice your opinions start a Twitter start a YouTube start a Facebook just start putting your ideas out there because they can't stop us all they depend on us being scared but if we're strong and if we all raise our voices together we're gonna help save this country and I just want to thank Candis Owens and the black sit movement this is truly a historic moment and I'm glad you all are a part of it so let's get it done let's get to work let's walk [Applause]", "XKm8WIMpzMU": "[Applause] and now without further ado please give a warm welcome to former arizona police officer and radio host brandon and a donator [Music] so when i first when I was sitting backstage I said you know what I'm gonna come out I'm gonna be calm you know I'm not gonna be crazy don't be calm but that ain't be tatum you know if you know me you know I can't become so I want y'all to stand up I want y'all to I got to participate y'all ready or what all right all right all right y'all got a little energy y'all gotta let energy so this is what I want you to do this is a call-and-response right I want you to say we're free and you'll repeat after me all right we're free yeah got a little bit in there we're free and that's what I want you to do because I wanted the meaning in your heart I want you to point at yourself and say I'm free let's do it again I'm free all right y'all sound good take a seat so the reason that I wanted to do that and I do that a lot when I speak because the power of life and death is in your mouth it's in your tongue you got to speak it for it to come to fruition you have to understand and internalize who and what you want to be and that will determine your future not the color of your skin not who your daddy was or who he wasn't not none of that stuff none of that stuff matters what matters is what you have in your heart and what you are willing to pursue and I say that because I have personal experience I grew up in and around the hood my whole life I've seen violence I've seen domestic violence I've seen drug addicts some of my family members when I was younger I'm gonna keep it real with y'all when I was younger I saw some of my family members sell drugs to my other family members and it was sad to see but it's true for my family members doing the rest of their life in prison one of them is for murder another's for drug Dylan forty years federal time he went in when he was 50 that's the rest his life another one of my cousins he shot three people in an altercation that he had no business being involved in he got 70 years that's pretty much the rest of his life and and so I saw that growing up I've been in houses where roaches are running around everywhere how many of y'all have been in house with roaches and all you do is you just wipe the wipe the plates off and you hope that the roads don't fall on you when you sleep at night some of y'all know about them roaches now I say the roaches went in my house we go my cousin them house they had roaches everywhere I grew up where they used to beat the crap out of you when you don't obey me you don't listen you get your butt whooped my cousin I'm gonna give you an example my cousin it was Super Bowl Sunday he's playing with a bike a bike chain he threw the bike chain up it hit the power line power went out for the whole block in a black neighborhood [Applause] my auntie I thought he's gonna die she was whooping him for like 45 minutes I'm like I don't even hear him screaming no mom he probably did but I grew up with it with it with a balanced perspective right some of the things I saw some of the situation I was in people would believe that I probably would amount to nothing then I probably go to jail I got arrested or I'll be in prison for the rest of my life like some of my other family members I got arrested when I was eight years old for smoking marijuana in a vacant house they put they powered all six of us in the back of a squad car handcuffed all six they put five of us and they laid one guy over the top and they called us sardines and I thought it was racist at the time I was like the only doing this because we black but when you grow up and you realize we were wrong in the hood I grew up in that was normal not having your dad around was normal and I want that to change I want our perception to change I was here last night we were I don't even know what the place was a 24-hour diner I got here 11 o'clock p.m. last night 24-hour diner what is the car that maybe midnight diner we roll up in midnight diner and the uber guy said I was restaurant we go up in there it's out of control you got people all outside they got police officers sitting at the front of the restaurant because people cannot act like they have any sense and the part that bothered me was that it was full of black people and and I'm telling y'all uncie God truth I had a whole speech plan but this is on my heart it affected me so much I literally want to cry because I hate where we have gone to we do not understand not all of us y'all perfect I'm tell my somebody else outside y'all understand what's up my somebody else we don't understand who we really are we have forgotten the power of what we really are our ancestors was beat some of them tortured molested separated from their families but you know how powerful they were they used the word of God and they couldn't even read they use the word of God to escape after the preach [Applause] when they had no future visible to them physical visible right you don't need to see to have vision they could not see past that plantation but they believed and in nowadays we claim it to be the white man's religion on the right man came up with the Bible the Bible meant more to the black folks than anybody else and we have used the Word of God to be free then and we need to use the Word of God to be free today and I'm gonna make a disclaimer if you don't believe in God whatever you believe in just just put it in that blank right there put that blinking there but I'm talking about God the God I know the God has delivered me the God has they had changed a young man like me I used to walk around my paying sagging like this thought I was cool I got tats all over my body I got young savage tattoo across my stomach for sure I got my hood tattooed on my forearms I say our gold teeth in my mouth but God changed me and it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a man that changed me it wasn't it wasn't a circumstances because I think we forget this is a spiritual battle as well only thing that changed me was when I say you know what i'ma give all this to God i'ma let God change me i'ma let God show me who I am because the black leaders won't let you down not all because any black leaders in here y'all perfect I'm so much some idea and some other denominational Church somewhere they'll let you down but God won't let you down God will make sure that you succeed now let me tell the story about how I became a conservative right I used to be a Democrat like probably many of you in this room I don't want to use the word Democrat cuz I don't want it to be about that I had an ideology that was off-center from who I really was I believed I was a victim I believe that the white man was holding me back III didn't realize or have any kind of accountability that I could see right I didn't want to look at it and say it's my own people that's doing this I didn't want to look at it and say my own I don't see like the white man in my community selling dope I ain't scared of white people in my community I'm gonna be I'm gonna keep it 100 we're growing up we see white people white people live on other side of town we see a couple police officers they weren't doing nothing riding around and you see her you rhond I saw anybody scared at him if you waiting you weren't cutting up they wouldn't talk to him why because they over somebody else have some couldn't up but some of the people in my community were the people that I was afraid of because if you came someone with the wrong colors on you'll get killed and nobody gonna snitch so let me get back to my point all of this stuff I've been through God saved me y'all got that point then I go from I'm gonna tell you where I transitioned that I was a police officer Tucson Police Department in Arizona I served six and a half years there I did everything I was a SWAT team I was a field training officer training new officers I've taught at the academy I was a spokesperson believe it or not I know it's surprising I spoke on behalf of the whole police part when I had only two years on a police department so I've accomplished our compass to light but I had this ideology from the left all of my boys on a Police Department we're like be I don't know why you say you're a liberal I don't know why you vote that direction because everything you stand on is completely against what you're what you're saying you represent you believe in life from the womb to the tomb you believe in a strong police department you believe in a strong family you don't believe in handouts all of the above that didn't sound like what you claiming to represent and all of that time I said no you know I'm saying Obama I'm gonna bomb on the first black president that's my dog you know I'm saying all of that stuff man and then he messed up he met he messed up he messed around and started dogging police officers he started making our jobs more dangerous he started making the public turn against us with all of these false phony stories and situations that he'd never corrected when he was wrong that when it was found out that the police did the right thing he never corrected the script and had people want to kill us and have people saying it we're racists and that we were against them even though we put our lives on the line to protect the very people let me let me finish my story I get off on a tangent I appreciate that appreciate that my brother appreciate that so he messed up with me and I said I will never I will never support anybody who cannot support the men and women who wear the badge and I said you know what I'm gonna start looking on the other side I'm gonna start looking to where y'all telling me to look I had never looked before and I loved ben Carson how many y'all love big heart big Carson it's one of the greatest men to ever live forget the color of his skin he's done things that nobody has done in the whole world he's a very kind guy meek spirit I've met him before and I met his wife great people some of the greatest the two of the greatest people I've ever met and I said you know he's gonna be my president he dropped out and endorsed Donald Trump and I was like I know he ain't treatment they can't pay him that much money Kenny so I said let me check this dude out right let's keep it 100 on the Trump was a celebrity I liked him big money Trump that's what he was he was making out of big business moves I wanted to be like him I ain't looking down on him I want to be rich like him so I said let me rule this guy out cuz I think he's just playing with the public you know he's just coming in and make a little flash get his little popularity on he out I want to is rally and I was blown away the people there were tremendous they were kind respectful they were Patriots they love this country and when I was there I share the same sentiment he got on stage he came out to WWE music I'm like this dude is a celebrity here superstar and then so when he cans it names talking about the border he was talking about support law enforcement pro-life I'm just like I like this guy for that point on I begin to support the President and I may I begin to support the ideas right I want I want to I want y'all to be very clear on this it's not about political parties it's not about a man or woman it's about ideas the ideas will transcend any political party these ideas have to be infused in your children because that means more than anything in the world so that's that was my path and how I became conservative my I didn't I didn't have a uh with a kind of red pill moment it was a digestive period right I had to digest a tree appeal it didn't sit well for me at first but it came to fruition but I want to talk I want to talk to you guys about this Candice told me I had all the time in the world I'll talk to y'all for an hour but I ain't finna do you like that unless I pass around so my friend my friend please we had a choir come out and sing and they would do another offering not just I miss with y'all but I want to talk to you guys about visualization right we talked a little bit a little bit about it at first but I'm gonna talk to you about visualization how important it is a lot of motivational speakers talk about it you hear it on the news what I mean you hear people talk about it and stuff like that but how do you bring that idea to being a real life concept and I'm gonna tell you what I used to do before I ever spoke to anybody and at this point I've spoken in I don't know 20 plus universities I just left the night before a crowd of a few thousand people I spoke at or event that I spoke at before I was ever a speaker I visualized I was on the airplane and I used to fly in the air my son is out of state I live in Seattle when I go see my son I used to envision myself being a speaker and I was on a plane I was I was thinking about writing down who I'm gonna speak to what the crowd is like I make this whole thing up people on a plane PI thought I was crazy and while I was on a plane I also sieved in my mind I said I imagined my wife sitting next to me alright I said I'm gonna have a wife one day I used to talk to her when the seat was empty I'll be talking to her people like man something to do got some wrong with him but those things begin to come to pass they become reality and and I want people to understand that never let go of your dreams write them down they complain write your dreams down it's not just a word it's not just a singing it's real life it will happen for you it can happen for you if you write them down and you believe them and and and I want to add to this too I want us to never make excuses never make excuses it's a waste of time it's a waste of energy it's a waste of emotion don't make excuses get it done I don't want to I don't want to hear nobody else nobody in this room I like I said y'all perfect I'm talking to somebody else there hear this on the livestream don't ever make an excuse and compromise your principles people would talk about abortion right that's a tough sell you know but I was dis and I was there stand by the principle life starts at conception not perception and if you make a mistake God is able to forgive you but don't don't sit around making excuses because then you allow the government to control your mind because you talked about the minimum wage people walk around a livable wage I live away yeah you cannot you can't have a 40 or 70 inch TV you probably came right out of Bentley you know I'm saying you can't go around with the high cellphone bill all the internet you probably have to scale it back understand how to how to live life and be able to to manage your life at a reasonable pace without making excuses because I started out with 8000 hour working at Verizon Wireless yeah yeah I've Eve been in that place it's not even Verizon Wireless supposed to be for rising around us but it's the go wireless it's the fake one they can't never get your plan right they're not even really connected to Verizon but they walk around with the uniform on God is my witness I said God you better get me out of here I quit this job $8.00 an hour I didn't make an excuse I showed up to work on time believe it or not I showed up to work on time I worked hard and I got promoted I won for that job to being a police officer more from being a police officer working my butt off every day now I'm a business owner I own my own business own corporation and and and you can do that if you plan it out you believe it and then make it happen all right so I finished with this I have your stand out one more time y'all got to get get on your feet I want y'all to get active man yeah I got a bunch of a wonderful people they're going to talk to you but I want you to be active I want you to think about this we're gonna say that the chant that we say it before cuz I wanted to be internalizing your spirit all right I want you to say after me we are free we are free and I want you to point at yourself because I want it to be personalized I am free I am free god bless you thank you guys and enjoy the show [Applause]", "Pe5u20JO2sk": "in my view we need bold changes in our criminal justice system as a first step we need to start treating prisoners like human beings private companies private corporation should not be proffered profiteering from their incarceration our emphasis must be on rehabilitation not incarceration and longer prison sentences in that regard the basic decisions regarding criminal justice and public safety must be the responsibility of the citizens of our country and not the investors in private corporations we should not tolerate conditions in prison that have no place in any civilized country people on opposite sides of the political aisle spend a lot of time shouting at one another the left creates a narrative the right response to the narrative but no one pauses to investigate all that's about to change one of my favorite things to do on the weekend is to explore leftists narratives throughout the 2016 election cycle presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders promised his supporters that if elected he would do away with the private prison facilities Bernie didn't get elected but that was a noble idea right I mean private prisons are the reason for mass incarceration they push through pieces of legislation to incentivize harsh convictions plus the inmates are treated like crap is that a fact or is it a narrative it's only one way to find out I'm going to prison so it's actually really funny about this drive is that it exactly reminds me the only visual recall that I have visiting my uncle in prison when I was a little tot was that it was the longest drive there was absolutely no scenery and it just looked green so I think a lot of these facilities are just in the middle of nowhere so it'll be interesting to see have not been back too since then my uncle served a sentence I actually don't know what he was in prison for but we went to go visit him and all I distinctly remember was a vending machine he used to just me and my sisters had the best time visiting him because we would just race back and forth from the vending machine and get money from my mom and dad and buy snacks so it's interesting to think about it now in the retrospect because people are always like Oh was that traumatizing for you as a little girl and it really wasn't like I remember it being like quite a pleasant experience I think what's super fascinating about the time that we live in now is that people just accept whatever anybody tells them to be to be true but nobody actually goes and explores thing goes on their own and I want to make a habit of always just going to see like okay if these detention centers are awful then I'm going to see a lot of awful things today if these private prison system are terrible and bad for the prisoners and I'm gonna see a lot of really terrible awful things for the prisoners and look definitely not wanted to mince words it's bad I'll say so we shall see it's so nice to meet you I'm Candace already my name is Aaron bang did anybody tell you why I'm here no ma'am no no idea just you just nice enough to just come speak to me yes ma'am okay so I have been really curious about a lot of the narratives that are circulated in the media that people just perceive to be true without actually going and speaking to the people that they're talking about so one such narrative is during the last presidential election cycle and a lot of the Kansas that are being elected for offices now a big platform that they run on is saying that they will abolish private prison groups like geo they say that these are their inhumane they're for profit the people are treated terribly here and that we should really only have DLC type facilities interesting base you made um now my experience here has been completely counter to that and I just wanted to see because you were you did you start your sentence in this no ma'am you did not no ma'am I've been in prison for 20 years Wow my first 16 years was in Department of Corrections Florida prison my last four years has been a Geo Prizm grouse you are the right person to speak to about this okay okay what are the differences the differences are astronomical when I was in the state prison I was not afforded an opportunity to do anything if you're in state prison you get up in the morning you're either gonna clean up the dorm or go to the rec yard since I've been a great feel of Geo facility I've been allowed to take several digital design classes computer classes I've graduated technology support class I've graduated digital design I've taken a business course I have taken faith base and I've also graduated faith-based and now I'm an assistant facilitator and teacher holes I believe that Society on a whole has taken many men that had drug addictions had issues and have thrown away locked them up and basically they don't want them in society any longer Gio I believe has provided an opportunity to say that hey lives can be rehabilitated Gio is willing to invest into people right and not treat us as inanimate objects okay on that investment I believe that Gio the faith-based community I believe the continuum of care I believe that they have found a way where they can say hey we can take men rehabilitate men and make men reintegrate able back into society so they are making an investment in the people that are here absolutely and you don't see that I do see level not at all and I believe the DLC does not want to make that investment and therefore they speak against it that's just my view of it well I've been to at least by ten prisons it's the best reason I haven't been to in my life you know and I was I just thank God that he made it possible for me to come here because being here I have got all the tools that I need to be successful this time when are we going reenter into our society I felt like if I had the tools that they give us here like the programs that they offer the first time my incarceration my pocket one had another prior conviction because they do kind of help you or they offer more as far as like my education the trays and then the continuing care to COC right I don't offer that at home POC camps they don't interesting give you 250 dollars so they give you fifty dollars and they just take it out the door out the door and that's it Wow so you've had that and in both prior circumstances you were not in jail that's how it is okay so you just literally were handed 50 bucks and like good luck with your life your local jeweler that's insane to me what were they expecting I guess I'm going to come back for you to come back right I mean that sounds insane but it seems like that's what they were expecting so here you've had programs what did you take could you do vocational did you go home energy D well I took IOP program and I already have my diploma so I try to sign up for the PC support class but I have transition that's a good that's a good thing it have enough time it's a big difference here at geo the education that I've received here that I believe it's going to make a very big difference when I'm released it's give me the tools that's necessary to take and to really make it on the outside and I've learned so much in that the guards here they they interact and they they try to do their best to give us everything that they can to if we have any problems and the education here they go far and above and beyond the call of duty to to see that we're educated in that that we are successful when we when we leave here from prison and the IOP it's great here we learned about addiction in their peer pressure where we need to live when we don't need to live relationships I've learned so much I go on and on and on about it in and the teachers here are wonderful and in it's it's sweet we eat good here we good here we're clothes good here and I I don't think that I really have a chance to be successful and I'm not gonna come back to prison because I have the tools and the resources now that's available to me when I'm released from here and it's it's all the way from from having transportation having the house and having clothing they've got all of that lined up for you all of that is line don't even and even more it's it goes on to even if I want to further my education which I do I want to go to college and in the geo group there they're gonna help me with my books or anything there that I might need to finish my education to further my education and it's it's I am very very grateful to be here in a private institution I've been in a dlci institution and they give you a few dollars and they send you on your way and they don't even say well hope you make it a good love you know and there's there's nothing in it's no wonder there the recidivism rate is it's terrible it's because they do not offer anything they do not offer any kind of help when you when we're released these men here we need help and we have hope here at that the geo group and it's hope so yeah I mean there's a big difference here they care about you I started off in a p1 the clothes class I had and then I went to a b3 and then I did on GED in 2013 then past January 2013 the paint design so I'm a certified painter in Florida now oh wow and I started to go to a landscape design I got 1,800 hours there so I'm thinking about pursuing that in a college or something when I get out because I'm going to a 12-step program to keep me sober what's over the whole time I've been in prison that is so very trouble I'm doing much better it's like a 180 so why do you think it is that politicians are saying the opposite that you know we have these politicians that are saying these are the bad guys geo group I don't know I've heard our president saying that we need to take and we need to educate prisoners and I believe that myself because education is its power wisdom is power and without it how can we be successful before not if we're not told we need to we need to learn how to be successful we need to we need to learn this and I'm I'm thankful that I'm learning a lot here they don't they felt like because you've been a competitive felon that you you're lost cause of loss holes we really trying to get out and better yourself but if I'm not given the necessary proper tools though you know right to help myself then that's probably what I want to bone so they don't want to you know actually want a crack they don't want they want to punish I have no idea maybe maybe they just scared for their jobs right yeah there's a lot of very very intelligent people in prison and very they're just there's so many different things people can do in here that it's amazing great some of the artists I've seen is some of the best art I've ever seen in my life has been in here like this is the first prison sentence that you're serving out where you've been offered a program that has helped you with that transition and these scenarios that they're giving you yes ma'am mom I really think this time that I've been to prison numerous times and I think this time that I'm really gonna be able to make it thanks to COC you know I really think gonna make it just I know I won't make it this time so grace field is great you know when co su is very great and I think DLC should have it to offer to you you know and you know and I'm you know the transitional house that's good too you know like it's gonna have stipulations but I need those stipulations something over me when I get out you know like a timetable to be in and this and that I need that I need that I was pretty down and out when I come to prison this place saved my life actually I lost my wife since I've been here and my brother died three weeks ago oh gosh I'm so sorry to hear that had like 18 friends died from drinking it and taking drugs right well I would have probably been with them too right you know but like I said justice it saved me it really has so if you could describe to me how do you how do you feel the general population feels here versus how the general population in the environment was when you were in Pensacola it's just a lot less tense I mean like I said we need area you really have nothing to look forward to but baggage ships were here you got a people that offers you a sense of support great and you know you there'll be a day when you you get out versus still see you're wondering if you're gonna make it out well honest with you and I mean here you mean he's still in prison but at the same time you have a more for opportunity more of a I guess of a upbeat from positive vibes that are around you as far as the they don't just consider your a throwaway individuals COC they give you the 100 all the Ross car hunted all the winn-dixie car they give you hygiene packages a bicycle for transportation or a bus pass and it's like they didn't give you that deal series like they sent me and say it'd help you sign up for school if you enrolled in school they help you get your tools if you already have a trade right it's like and they wasn't offering Wow so you were part of the faith-based community can you let me know what that's like the faith-based dorms um the faith-based dorms are an opportunity I believe the faith-based dorms create an opportunity for men that are in prison that want to live a better life that want to do better they want to rehabilitate themselves they provide that opportunity for them we structured classes that deal with attitudes health and family marriage and family mentoring and one of the things that I've done is that I've taken an opportunity to try to reach out to young men in 2007 my 17 year old son was murdered in New Orleans oh my good and I've made it a purpose of my life to try to reach out to young men to deter them from gang culture gang activity and the faith-based dormitory has provided me a great opportunity to do that and the optimism that's here is because people that are incarcerated here feel as if they have an opportunity feel as if they have a chance to actually succeed to actually be reintegrated back into society most of the men that I talk with in faith-based men that are teaching classes and I teach on conflict resolution anger management these guys feel like they haven't just been thrown away they feel like they have an actual chance to be make a difference frame to change and change their lives and I truly believe that that what I have been given here the opportunities that I've been given I would have never have gotten these opportunities in state prison [Music] okay so I'm just going to tell you guys my initial emotions walking out of there immediately frustrated and angry and upset that our politicians lie they live for the sake of getting votes and they lie on the backs and on the lives of inmates the consensus obviously you will see the footage the consensus here is that these prisoners thank God that they are in a private system they have all spent time in public systems and they tell you that the overwhelming difference is that in private systems they make an investment in the person and they feel that they can leave here rehabilitated whereas in the public systems it was punitive and they felt like just another number and they were kicked out with fifty dollars in a bus ticket it is jarring to me that we have politicians in an effort to demonize capitalism that are willing to take away the only real chances that these men feel that they have to be reintroduced into society in a productive manner my heart completely broke I guess in all of the best possible ways speaking to that last inmate who we know is going to be in there for life and just seeing what optimism he had because he was a part of a faith-based community he spent 14 years in a public system and now he's in a private one and he thinks God every day because he gets to get up and he gets to teaches others about everything that he has learned within the walls that he's never going to leave I guess the theme here is what I realized in my life which is that leftists lie they will lie their way all the way to the top and they don't care about those men in there they don't care about those men who are so inspired and grateful that geo and other groups like them have stepped up to the plate to provide real opportunities whereas the public has just completely given up on them the public prison system does not make an investment in their futures whatsoever groups like this really do you hear from 90 to 95% of the people that are incarcerated will be coming home they're gonna come back to be our late we're still live with us so while we have them in our custody again you know why not do something differently if you continue to do the same thing continue to have people there then you're gonna get the same results that's why you know several years ago when we looked at what's happening 2017 GM invested almost 10 million dollars you know and they creating a continuum of care division Wow ten million dollars invested in continuum care but the narrative out there is that all you guys care about is your bottom line so how does that translate room best and providing that government services so we got a financial investment in that to do the best we can to be better than anybody else we always are striving to be the best not just because you know it sounds good but we're dealing with individuals who are incarcerated and we can make a positive difference in their life how do you measure success in these programs so some of the key performance indicators that we look at regarding programming there's a few specific ones that we look at high school equivalency diploma or GED diplomas that are earned substance abuse programming completions as well as vocational certifications when you look at 2017 we provided our participants over 2,600 GE DS or high school equivalency diplomas to that population that we also provided 8400 participants with a substance-abuse completion certification and over 7400 completed vocational programming I wanted to mention just about post-release services that that call center that's based out of our corporate office is accessible 24 hours a day seven days a week so when those participants are released so now we're beyond that 90 days prior they are provided a 1-800 number so they can call anytime to talk to their case manager that an assigned case manager and we continue to make contact with them for up to 12 months and during those contacts for going back to that transition plan and ensuring that we've met those goals and those needs and some of those services if it's housing food clothing for work maybe tools for work we'll provide that service to them at no cost to that participant in the community so we're making sure that we are provided with the best opportunity to succeed and at our Graceville facility we've seen a 40% reduction in the return rate so those coming back to incarceration since the inception of the continuum of care and the full continuum of care with those early services out of that facility [Music] okay guys so next I am headed to the James Club the James Club is a community nonprofit that helps with inmates integrating into society after their incarceration they're one of many local organizations that partner with the Geo group to focus on this transition period so let's go speak to some of these people and see if these programs are actually helping them James club is open to everyone looking to turn their life around okay we offer a second chance to men so many of our of our clients struggle with drugs and/or alcohol or in the past criminal behavior or a myriad of other addictions that commonality is they're looking to better their life and become self-sufficient do you exclusively work with people that are coming out of the prison system or if they're just people at are struggling with in their communities are they welcome to come and join the James Club recovery center as well that's a good question they are welcome of course but we're dedicated to helping men when they first get out of jail or prison and we're delighted to be working with the Geo group so that they can become productive and successful members of society how long have you been working with the Geo group for two years now and what does that process been like what are the results that you're seeing it's been beyond amazing okay to watch men come in when they first come out of prison to watch their recovery progress to watch them become gainfully employed to watch their self-esteem improve at the James club for example on the weekends as a group we feed the homeless together we go to soup kitchens we go to nursing homes we provide employment placement services so we're really trying to make a difference in the community I don't think the public knows the truth I see real-life examples of men that are coming into a program like the James club from an entity like the geo group and then to watch these men recover and become good husbands and good fathers and become honest men that's our key we want men to do the right thing so I think if there was more exposure to the outcome where there's more stories on these individuals how they now become self-sufficient because of an entity like the geo group I think the perception from the public might change ok so it can't all be good there's got to be some people that attempt to go through this process and doesn't work well for them do you find what are what statistically speaking how many people fall into that category versus people that actually are able to get their lives started and contribute to society again well that's very true not everyone is a success story but we found many times that we plant seeds so even if someone comes in initial you know it appears that that person did not become a success story many times they'll come back to our program and they'll still benefit from the experience my name is dawn I grew up in South Carolina I lived in Los Angeles for 16 years before I had to come to Florida to serve my sentence I have a sentence of three years for trafficking okay I was an addict for 19 years very long time of my life very dark time and I came and did my time in Florida and I'm once I did my time at the GEO Group I was placed into the James Club Wow so what what is the James Club experience been like for you how long have you been there and what are you it laughs because this is a funny story when I first got out you know I'm I was very thankful to Gio because they give you a voucher and that was my stepping stone I wasn't looking to be in recovery I wasn't taking it seriously because my head wasn't in the right place but when you got out yeah when I got but after a couple of months of being there and getting to know the people in the program what it stood for and where I could be at in my life I took it seriously I did my step work I got a great sponsor and I did the deed of what I needed to do to put me in a better place because I was so tired and being stuck in his cycle of being an addict of getting so much in life and then losing it again and doing it over and over again because that cycle was just not working for me so was that your first sentence or had you spent time and my first in it was your first so you were actually blessed to be the put into a private prison for your first time whoa you just don't know why nobody wants to hear that Prison is a great experience but it was a rewarding experience because I took it seriously they placed me in the therapeutic community program which is basically a substance abuse program and I had a great counselor who work with me and she met with me every week and it's what basically set me on the path to where I am today to be able to sit here with you right you know in a nice dress shirt suit you know tired pants and be able to go to work this afternoon and have money in the bank and save up to you know buy a house and it's just it was the forefront of where I am today it's just a pinnacle right and I'm appreciative of that what am I going to do with that blessed thing is now that I have completed the steps I'm starting to sponsor guys which it adds a little more pressure to me but I think I need that pressure right now because I needed to keep me big busy and keep my mind focused on the positive attributes of life that's guys I feel great when I'm able to sit down with my sponsor and tell him hey I actually talked to somebody today who really needs help and I think I can help them it just makes me feel good internally to know that I'm able to put that bless that blessing back out there exactly because I'm I did was I was worried about becoming a negative statistic because we're all statistics maybe one of us are statistics yeah but you don't have to be a negative one you can be a positive statistic and that's what I want to do I want to be one of those people that it makes even though if it's a small difference in the world I just want to do something that's good right for change instead of looking out for myself all the time I was sentenced for grand theft but I was purchasing materials from a company that I shouldn't have been what a manager was kind of involved in it was a sting operation I got set up okay and I want to losing my electricians license over it and my contracting license over it and then they suspended it for five years state of Florida did now I guess I came out and I I started I actually geo set me up with the with the James Bond they got me you know instead of dumping me on the street with 50 dollars like a DLC would and just a bus ticket to wherever and said see you later you know I got started back you know I've only been off thirty days Wow but I have 25 congratulations so you were in for two and a half years I was in for two and a half years okay yes so I've got 25 customers now and helping guys you know give them guys jobs out of the house and stuff like really yeah already 25 customers yep I just got my uh just apply for an LLC yesterday and then my tax ID number and stuff like that that'll all be gone through in like another seven days so it was my mind because like I was saying to earlier to see how politicians sell the story of what happens right and of course prisoners and inmates they can't speak for themselves right so people jump on a platform and they talk for you and they say I'm gonna do the inmates a favor and I'm gonna abolish the private prison system because it's ridiculous that there's a profit market and the inmates are better off under state-run facilities yeah they're crazy they're crazy they're crazy why do they do it I can't nobody can give me an answer as to why they would do that why wouldn't they want your light to you better why wouldn't they want you to have another opportunity to get out go to James club recovery and restart your life and file an LLC yeah they just set people up for doubtful I was NGO about a year and four months okay so you obviously heard a little bit why why why I'm here I've just been sort of exploring I'm really interested in the prison system and it makes because I grew up where all of my uncles were in prison and they served multiple sentences for various things they were always in the State Penitentiary and they were never in a private prison system I had this idea growing up that private prison facilities were evil because that's what I was taught from the mainstream media they sort of say you know they don't have opportunities here they should be exclusively going to state-run facilities and we have a lot of politicians that now get on a platform and say they're going to abolish a private prison system so I'm now learning obviously that that is not the correct narrative and I just want to hear a little bit about your experience inside of a geo facility I put in for a good adjustment transfer and a lot of the inmates are saying well it's going to take it might take up three or four years and so I waited and within two weeks I was moved to Blackwater which is a private facility and it was like nine-day you know more more health care more concern for the prisoners welfare so it's a big difference between state-run facilities and private facilities that was my first rodeo okay yeah and God willing my last right so I wanted to say I put a couple private prisons because another inmate told me that they were better if you're gonna do town that's what I was curious about so the inmates understand there's an understanding amongst the inmates in public systems that the private ones are better and that if you want better conditions you need to transfer over into a private prison absolutely I just put my faith in God you know and he had me gone within two weeks Wow so you said earlier that you wanted to focus on your future I love that because I always say to people focus on your future instead of focusing on your past what does that look like for you for me the future looks very bright I was able through the private facility Blackwater to be introduced to the geo group a lot of the guys if they don't have life skills they just go back to the same things and they want right back up in the system so like I said about how its grace I was able to get through the jail program and the sky singer I sat down with her she took my case and she she said that's awesome once I told my story she saw my compassion I let her know that I made a mistake but I was remorseful of it so she took my case she put it to the front and she said this one's gonna make it make sure his get to the top because he's gonna make it from there I had the privilege of having Ralph Ritz as my case managers the world's best case manager for geo coop and he was able to get me in a James Club that has made a tremendous impact on my life today I am a manager at the James Club and it's all about God's grace that I sit here and have the GEO Group and James Club in my life to help me be a better man a better person and a better child of God your voice is so important it which is so important and it pains me to know that politicians don't care to hear these voices and things that to get the word out about what's actually happening you said that by God's grace there are people that mentored you I believe fully that you're going to be a person that mentors other younger people that are coming out and need guidance and need what I think is the most important issue in the black community is father absence absolutely having men that are available for them to show them what's right and what's wrong and I feel that God has blessed me by just letting me sit next to you and hear your story so I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart thank you it's been as I just want to say one more quickly of course I wanted to say I believe I'm you know as a crazy that might sound that God allowed me to had this experience right so I could help other men coming out of jail in prison that still lost that still on drugs and alcohol so you know through our struggles and through our hardships good can still come out of it God picks people to go through certain things I've lived through so many things you know different parents uncles going through certain things that I saw when I was young I genuinely believe that all of those things were blessings from God because he knew that one day I was going to have a voice and I was going to be able to get the right story out and God put you and I in this room together and these cameras and these camera guys so that we could get this message out I promise you I'm going to get that message out thank you I'm not going back I'm not going back this time I I don't think I'm ever gonna come back again that was what you heard over and over again and what's interesting is that they had all been back to prison but they was their first time ever being a part of a private prison facility and they felt that they had finally been given the tools to better their lives you heard them say that the difference is that the public system is punitive and the private system is rehabilitate we rehabilitate people who are alcoholics we rehabilitate people who are suffering from drug addictions why aren't we also rehabilitating people who are leading lives of crimes why don't we demand a system like the private prison facilities that rehabilitates inmates so that they never come back ever again I think that's the biggest takeaway for me this is a facility that they are going to die inside of and they feel grateful to God for being able to be in the private prison system I hope that when people watch these that when people see what's actually happening when people hear the voices from the actual inmates and it maces them it makes them pause for a second that people pause and they realize that we make decisions for people it's a narrative and it's a disgusting narrative it it makes me question everything and the biggest question that I have is why what is the point on lying on these inmates what is the point of trying to create a situation for them that they don't want I think the obvious answer is that it's for votes and sitting down with them was incredibly emotional especially knowing that some of them are never ever ever going to step outside of that facility ever again it's so important that we understand the implications of the decisions that we make politicians can jump on stage and they can generate so much emotion we need to be careful that they're not manipulating our emotions for votes geo is not some greedy capitalist company despite what all the media would have you believe that is trying to hurt inmates they're trying to help them they're not trying to help them they are helping them why aren't our politicians wanting to get the truth out about that why are they interested lying to the public and that's a wrap you now have the facts don't fall for the narrative again", "a8ZARshwdiw": "ladies and gentlemen without further ado please give a big welcome to your blexit founder candice owens hey hey guys man it's so nice to be back on stage in a room with people all this coven 19 craziness look at this right this is awesome guys so awesome so much i want to say here but i'm going to speak later i just want to get the show started and basically give you guys a background hey bryson hey parson bryson has a song called i feel like candace owens be sure to download that at some point it's a great song um okay right um this is amazing uh just first off it's just amazing to be in the room with everybody after everybody being separated um just so not natural for humanity to to go through that and to be separate [Music] i want to tell you guys a little bit about the blexit story why i started this 501c3 not-for-profit um where my heart was and why i think this is the most significant thing that is happening in america right now um and to all of you guys who have volunteered were now in 20 plus states these people put their heart into this and people laughed and thought it would never happen um you know we start with the we got love video we created this i have an amazing creative team because i just never remembered growing up america feeling the way that it feels right now or looking the way that it looked right now i don't remember this black community that the media is showing us this angry uh bitter looting rioting upset that's not what the black community was when i was growing up i grew up watching the fresh prince of bel-air the jeffersons the winslow's family matters all of these shows that were about family togetherness about having issues with solving them at the dinner table by the end of the day and that if there was an american spirit at that time i swear the 90s was the golden decade i have very fond memories of the 90s and suddenly we've seen a dramatic shift and suddenly everything is racialized right and suddenly it's black versus white and and we are not allowed to be in the room together like we are right now uh because all of you white people are racist and all of you black people are oppressed and there's this horrible horrible fracturing of americanism that's happening in the process we're forgetting what it means to be an american so we started the blexit organization blexit i'm sure you figured out by now stands for the black exit encouraging minorities to exit from this progressive narrative to realize that we value the same things in life this country we value faith we value family but most importantly we value freedom [Music] we value the ability for us to make our free decision to come here today right to decide to be with one another not to have a government tell us where we can go what we can do and who we can speak to that's what this country was founded upon so tonight you're going to hear from an amazing cast of speakers people that i look up to that have mentored me and you're going to see what i view to be the black story in america we're going to go through three phases the first is the concept of liberation um which was i guess this idea that after slavery black people had been freed and yet something happened in the 1960s with lyndon baines johnson and the proliferation of the welfare state um and everything changed and suddenly black america arrived suddenly into the wilderness which is where we are today right where we see a desolate community a hopeless community and it's a community that the government has stripped everything away from you know when the government decides it's going to be your god it's going to be your family um and last of all we will not leave you on a sad note we're going to take you to the promised land which is where i believe we are going so ladies and gentlemen without further ado thank you guys so much for coming it's going to be a wonderful show with the most impactful speakers i will be out later but just oh by the way i'm pregnant [Applause] just wanted to throw that out there for fun six months very exciting stuff [Applause] people keep asking me what it is it's a patriot it's a patriot [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] so ladies and gentlemen enjoy the show we have so much to show you and we'll get started thanks so much i'll be back [Music] later so so you"}
