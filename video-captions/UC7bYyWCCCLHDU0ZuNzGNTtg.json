unvaccinated he is not allowed to play however he is allowed to go to the games sit courtside not wear a mask and hug his teammates hang out watch the game interact with people but he's not allowed to put on a jersey and actually play science this is what sparks trevor noah's comments right here in new york city mayor eric adams has lifted the rule that you have to be vaccinated to attend indoor events okay that's gone but there is still a rule that you have to be vaccinated to go to your workplace so kyrie can go inside not wear a mosque even hug a teammate but he cannot play i mean i'm gonna give the guy credit because at least he's using his platform to say something now this is what we have been saying all along trevor is saying nothing new those with a functional brain have been

and anti-blackness what they don't tell you is is that after desegregation they cemented in more than 2 000 swimming pools in the country primarily in black neighborhoods this was also the rise of country clubs which became exclusive to whites only so that their kids could still learn how to swim so when we see black folks drowning at four and five times the rate of white people just know it is not by chance it is all by Design obviously those are atrocities that happened many many years ago but we're living in 2022 where you have access to every Beach to every pool go to a lake figure it

today i actually have a guest with me i have the one and only matt walsh he is a best-selling lgbtq children's author a biologist and now a documentarian as an award-winning documentarian there we go i'm sorry you're award-winning i've decided yeah let's identify myself matt walsh last night released his new documentary what is a woman it premiered on daily wire it is an incredible piece of content could you walk people through like a one minute pitch of the documentary what you learned um how long it took to film yeah this was a year-long process it was a you know an idea that i had almost exactly a year ago which was to take this question what is a woman um that after it occurred to me years before that that uh this is a question that basically brings down the entire gender ideology house of cards and i i did spend you know in fairness to me i spent a couple of years trying to get the left to respond to it on twitter or just like talk about in speeches and on the show and everything and they ignored it and so then i said well now we gotta go out and like present the question to them actively um and uh that took us all across all across the world but this is what i keep telling the left is like this is your fault you could have just answered my tweet and you none of this had to happen one of my very favorite things when i was watching it is that you approached every interview with the same attitude regardless of what side you were talking about and i think that that is you know positioning you as basically a better journalist than anybody that we are seeing in mainstream media right now because you actually pushed for the truth on both sides of the trans issue yeah people have been after watching this have been accusing me of being objective and fair which actually i'm not at all but in this film we decided i mean i would have loved to and there are many times when we're making the film but i wanted to just start like yelling at people because i obviously have a perspective and an opinion on this subject very much so but um we realize that that's not first of all that's what everyone expects me to do it's what everyone expects all of us to do especially conservative media making something like this you're expected to be just kind of like going around saying your opinion um we didn't think that'd be as powerful and also we we want to give gender ideology basically a chance to sort of hang itself by its own by its own answers to the or really non-answers to these questions so the idea was let's just go let's have some really basic very fair questions and we're just going to go and ask them and see what kind of responses we get and clearly it was effective because last night during the premiere we had a ddos attack on the daily wire server and ddas is a denial of service attack where basically they use a bunch of bots and they flood a website so that people couldn't actually watch the film so obviously they're angry they hate it so i thought we would read some of the tweets um about how terrible of a person you are like this man right here he says it's funny how it's mostly men trying to hem women into a corner and mostly men who are not exactly the most manly men at that a real man allows women to define themselves you're not manly i mean i'm wearing i wear the flannel for like the entire film so i don't know what else can i do uh you know that that that's obviously absurd what we're what we're trying to do first of all how can you have any i mean he's i guess he's pretending that he's uh defending women or whatever but if you don't even know what a woman is then you can't do anything with respect to women so the idea here first of all is to like affirm the fact that women and this is good news for you women exist so you exist and uh and you have like a unique uh identity that is not something that can just be appropriated and and worn like a halloween costume so have you ever been called a toilet brush before i have not but this is a lot of fun you have been now the fact that on the second day of pride month and actually was the first day she got that wrong uh conservative toilet brush matt walsh releases an a piece of the most flagrantly and unapologetically transphobic pieces of modern media it should tell you exactly how unsafe the trans and lgbtq communities at large are in modern america see you you are not unsafe i'm not doing anything to you physically um however maybe your your world view that you've constructed for yourself might be a little bit unsafe it is now in jeopardy because of it has come up against some basic skepticism so i could see that i suppose because you're a violent hateful toilet brush that too as well yes exactly now one thing i've been seeing going around a lot is that you went to africa and you uh spent time in kenya you were talking to a tribe there people are saying that you found the one transphobic uh tribe that believes in a gender binary out of 3 000 tribes in africa you picked the one transphobic one right just the one just everywhere else it just so happens that we happened to land right in africa and kenyan if we'd gone anywhere else we would have found people we would have found yeah if i had gone anywhere else in africa they would have talked to any other tribe yeah they would have said oh yeah pansexuals we have those here i mean right furries we have everything else right i mean look here's my and that that has been the response by the left to the to the africa bit in particular first of all they're so mad that i went to africa and told the tribes people about their gender ideology and the tribes people laughed and made fun of it like the left is so mad about that it's great hilarious i love it but my challenge is to anybody out there go if you want to go to africa and talk to a different tribe bring a camera crew and fly film it because i'd love to see that go outside of the western world and try to find anyone who agrees with you on the topic of gender and uh go ahead i mean if you can do it then i'll be very impressed i have do you watch tick tock at all um i i use it for content every once in a while it's the only time i i watch it well i use it every day clearly it's great for content well no it taints my brain but you know what it's good and i found this video of somebody um he's challenging you to something i just want you to watch this i want to propose a challenge to matt walsh of the daily wire i want to challenge matt walsh to a boxing match if he wins then he can publish his documentary and i will actively promote it if i win he doesn't publish a documentary and he has to send ten thousand dollars to every single person he's deceived with this documentary of course i know that this is never going to happen because matt walsh is a coward who would rather yell people behind a screen and cower when he sees them in real life yeah first of all i wouldn't i've never hit a child in the first place and that kid looks like he's about 12. so that's that's really that's lily to you oh lily okay identifies as a is that identifies as a girl trans rat i try well i don't hit whatever that is either um but uh but but also i i appreciate that he's gonna give me permission to release the film if i win the boxing match but actually unfortunately we just released it anyway so it's a little it's a little bit late for that and well maybe i'll come back with uh with something else he actually i wanted to show you some other content from this creator this is kind of what we're dealing with your non-fan base [Music] what has happened i don't know why is happening [Music] it would be really interesting to see this individual promote my film so in some ways i'm tempted to take a tick whoever it is up on on this offer they could do interpretive dance conservative dance promoting my film on tick tock would be fantastic you know i was on an all access live and people were all access live is what we do for um all access daily wire members we do live streams all of our the hosts here and we chat with the members and it's great but um there was a lot of people that are fans of yours that were asking me if you are actually going to do an interpretive dance when you hit a million subscribers on youtube i don't know what in a moment of sheer insanity for some reason and i can't even remember why i said it but i did say on my show that when we get to a million i'll do an interpretive dance and celebration i don't know why i said but then and i immediately regretted it and the next day i don't want to go back on my word but the next day i gave i said i was very honest and raw and open with my audience and i said vulnerable i i never should have made that uh that promise and i'm gonna give the audience a chance to release me of the promise and they all said no we're gonna make you do it because they're a bunch of bullies i get bullied by my own audience well that's good i on alive said that i would get a daily wire tattoo when i hit a million subscribers that would that was bad that might be even worse yeah i don't know i would i would take that over the interpreter maybe we should switch i would do an interpretive dance i would collab with lily the rat girl we should talk about that yeah all right we can do that we can make a switch my last thing for you is that what is a woman has been trending all day number two in entertainment it's wild i just wanted to ask did you know that you were um trending right above a fatherly article now fatherly is a publication that uh tries to empower dads to raise good kids seems nice in a nutshell fatherly was trending for an article saying yes you should take your kids to a pride parade but have these conversations first now the first tweet is this one it says pride parades and pride festivals that follow are noisy and crowded they're filled with sites that may be new to kids like public nudity and kink so is it appropriate to take your young kids to pride and then there's an entire thread explaining the conversations that you should have and they kind of end it by saying all in all it's great for kids to be there because they can sit on the side of the parade and they'll be thrown toys and cheerios literally they said cheerios by by the naked trans people bdsm kings yes yeah so that's what that's what we're dealing with what is a woman and taking am i am i trending above that nonsense at least you are okay well then a little bit of that that's the most you can hope for on twitter is you had a little glimmer of sanity surrounded by utter filth and insanity so guys if you want to see what is a woman go to what is a woman.com become a daily wire member you need to see this brilliance it is an incredibly important film the left doesn't want you to see it they are actively suppressing it and why why would they look at this hateful violent person don't don't suppress him he's award-winning and he's brilliant yes we can't do that anyway guys go check out the film thank you matt this was fun thank you guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make

of you know by now that I started my career in acting I was a child actor in Los Angeles and New York and Atlanta for about 10 years it is literally what I dedicated my childhood in adolescence to I love filmmaking and acting more than anything but I really hate to see what has become of Hollywood and storytelling and it just it breaks my heart but today we're going to talk about somebody who's actually standing up against some of this nonsense but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection so Emily Blunt I'm sure you guys know her and love her she is married to the incredible John Krasinski she's a fantastic actor she is super British and cute they have an adorable family she is a badass who plays Incredible characters she has caused a stir in Hollywood's woke group think due to an interview that she gave Indy wire last week variety reported on it here they linked their article on it and here's her quote it is the worst thing ever when you open a script and you read the words strong female Elite Emily Blunt says that makes me roll my eyes I'm already out I'm bored those roles are written as an incredibly stoic she goes on the Mobsters aren't gonna like that because apparently us women are only supposed to be big jacked feminist hulking women [Music] because that is true empowerment not actually trying to be complex or nuanced or embrace our femininity whatsoever don't even think about it now her whole quote reads it is the worst thing ever when you open a script and you read the words strong female lead that makes my eyes roll I'm already out I am bored those roles are written as incredibly stoic you spend the whole time acting tough and saying tough things blunt said that her latest character Cornelia in the western Revenge series The English is far more surprising than what the simplified strong female lead label describes she is innocent without being naive and that makes her forced to be reckoned with the actor added she went on to say she loves a character with a secret I love her sang them and I loved Cornelius buoyancy her hopefulness and her guileness she startles Eli out of his silence and their differences become irrelevant because they need each other to survive I thought that was very cool blunt joins a growing list of female actors who have spoken out against the strong female lead label She-Hulk attorney at law the worst series ever actor Tatiana Maslany told the guardian in August that it is frustrating for roles to be reduced to that one strong trait it's reductive she added it's just as much a shaving off of all the nuances and just as much of a Trope it's a box that nobody fits into even the phrase is frustrating it's as if we're supposed to be grateful that we get to be that literally yes it's like all of these Hollywood execs think that making a super masculine bodybuilding female character is just going to eradicate the patriarchy in one swoop they reduce them to nothing they reduce them to stereotypes and then throw them meaningless bones like this whether it be telling black people that they are not smart enough to vote without an ID or whether it's something like this where they don't write nuanced or complex characters for women or gay people or anybody else but instead they just shove us into sloppily done remakes and say look at you you're being represented now like they are pretending like they care while being underhandedly offensive it's like the backwards racism all over again now Hollywood might not like what these women have to say but the audience certainly does I loved the comments on all of the articles about Emily Blunt as somebody said as the viewers so are we meaning they're also incredibly tired of that Trope somebody else said Chad Emily Blunt yes she's a giga Chad somebody else said what an absolute 11 out of 10 of a woman and a pro and the funny thing is she has played some of the most interesting and complex and strong female yet feminine characters in modern Cinema never fails to deliver her part instantly took a liking to her since I watched the edge of tomorrow it is abundantly clear that Emily Blunt is not just going to say yes to any character that is thrown her way she is very selective like I said I love every role that she does they're fantastic you should go watch her movies somebody else said surprise variety is even giving her a voice with views like those somebody else said also way overplayed is that we want this woman to look really cool so she's going to order a whiskey at the bar that'll do it that'll smash the patriarchy that'll make her look like a unattainable badass sex icon somebody else said jacked woman protagonist exactly that's why everybody needs balance of nature this comment cracked me up this guy Frank said who would put that in a script and this person responds and says no writer I think she's making it up though it's possible her agent is writing that in pen thinking it will entice her so I wanted to go see who this blue check Lex Jurgen guy is he's some weird podcast host and writer with barely any followers who is obviously Riding High with his new new blue check mark that he paid for with Twitter blue Elon I love you but this whole thing is just a show I was very sad to see that this is absolutely real writers do put this into scripts and they obviously write female characters that are part of this Trope and yes you are right agents do write things like that in character breakdowns for actors to entice them because people want to feel like oh I'm playing a strong female lead obviously all of that is true this is what Google had to say about the strong female character it literally took me 30 seconds to find out that this is a real thing Lex it says the strong female character is a stock character the opposite of the Damsel in Distress in the first half of the 20th century the rise of mainstream feminism and the increased use of the concept in later 20th century have reduced the concept to a standard term of Pop Culture fiction even Google is saying that we have been reduced to a stereotype it's not that hard to look into and if that does not convince you here are two character breakdowns that I pulled from my acting days that literally took 30 seconds to find these are from the last couple of years this one soccer player with a Mean Streak who has it out for she Prides herself on her strength and is certainly strong she can leg press a whole lot she's jealous to be losing playing time to a freshman and it shows her behavior oh she can leg press a lot what a strong female character that certainly has a lot of nuance here's another one a child of small town Oklahoma tomboyish tough braver than most this tough circumstances force her to grow up too fast by 16 she's already taking care of herself and she's used to her nare do well father being in trouble but when he's killed by the drug dealers he works for she finds herself next on their list and doesn't feel like running away when a homeless veteran living under a bridge saves her life convinces him to teach her how to kill like I said Lex it's very common now it is also somewhat unsurprising for Emily Blunt to come out and say this type of thing because many for the past few years have been coming after she and John Krasinski her husband for the films that they produce and star in just look at these screenshot shots I took this is a question from Cora is John Krasinski conservative is it a coincidence that he plays roles in military pro-gun movies oh my God an actor plays somebody with a gun they must be a Maga this one is John krasinski's movies have some convinced that the actor is a secret Republican are they based who knows who cares but they tell good stories and they refuse to conform to Hollywood's

there's one more comment this guy said I've read some dumb [\u00a0__\u00a0] in my time but this is the first time I have felt Beavis and Butthead are unrecognizable philosophical Geniuses by comparison well done literally yes that's all I have to say about that before we get into it there is a bit of speculation around the articles on this particular site because many believe that it is satire and honestly I hope that it is because listen to this I can't help but feel like this trend is The Usual Suspects culturally appropriating something that was never meant for them in the first place the body positivity movement was created by women specifically black women as a brilliantly sassy yet empathetic response to the unrealistic standards of beauty imposed on us by Western culture it wasn't designed for privileged white males who already conformed to their own Traditional Values of masculinity it was meant for those of us who often feel invisible and unworthy because we don't fit into the patriarchy's white supremacist definition of beauty I wouldn't have assumed that that satire that's literally real life if this is a leftist writing this trying to like dunk on conservatives like a lot of people say it is you're failing terribly because this is literally what so many people think there's another line it says body positivity is for women led by black women to celebrate our diversity shapes and sizes and to finally feel like we belong in a world that has always told us we don't body positivity is for women who have been systemic oppressed until their entire lives that they are not good enough body positivity is for women who have been taught to hate themselves because they don't look like Barbie not for dudes who can already pass as Ken snaps screw you men Third Way feminism boom they also have a little infographic on the side of the article that says staying in your own lane white guys have their own things like khakis mayonnaise Abercrombie and man buns don't appropriate from women's culture and don't steal things that women especially black women have created again this feels real especially just the stuff about oppression and the patriarchy and having to you know fit into a misogynistic worldview that is literally what the body positivity movement is so this is just another example of the left can't meme so be it it's god-awful and the reason why I think that it might be satire is because there are a couple of Articles saying like oh this site dupes conservatives and I saw a few comments going like haha this is satire but again in doing this show with the content that I consume it's kind of depressing because often I don't know what is real life and what is satire but there are very few references to the site as a whole the author of The Blog is non-existent on the website that's actually suspended from Twitter right now the information on the publication is incredibly limited if this is actually satire if this is the case they are not doing a good job at separating reality from their satire because first of all they linked this real legit article within their own it says sexy dad bods are not progress fetishizing beer bellies only fat shames others if the choice is just Zac Efron or Seth Rogen we are leaving a lot of guys out of the conversation like sorry guys you can't win apparently men being in body positivity is just fat shaming maybe it's not racism but it definitely is fat shaming and while the women's body positivity movement sees no end you can literally be morbidly obese people will be like oh my God yes Queen love it you're so healthy for men you can apparently take it a little too far you can get a little too fat for mince taste because this article says when does male body positivity go too far the subtitle is some metrics for measuring human Fitness is our bunkum but ignoring them all together is equally dangerous now if you said this about a woman you would be deemed misogynistic and fat phobic and sexist but of course you can say it about men and writers across the internet agree that they feel left out like this man wrote on his own blog body positivity is for women only do men even care about how women look and then he talked about how he felt left out as a bigger-bodied man a fatter man a bigger body oh my God I sound like a leftist oh my God I've consumed too much of the Kool-Aid I've become the very thing you swore to destroy and then there's another article where do men fit into the body positivity movement there are also a few fantastic horror discussions about it but this was actually my favorite exchange why is there not a movement for body positivity for larger men body positivity for women at any size is rising now as it should be and not nearly far enough disagree with that I think we've I think we've gone very far but it seems that larger men are still stigmatized by most why this response is so great because having been an overweight man we can actually handle the brutal truth we aren't beautiful most women find us repulsive and obesity is extremely unhealthy if you don't like it do something about it I did I lost 50 pounds and I kept it off women prefer to ignore the problem and demand that everyone around them lie to them about how healthy and beautiful they are regardless of their weight literally yes but it honestly is not just women it is the entire society that we live in right now the victim heavy Society where everybody wants their problems and their unhealthy choices to be normalized and affirmed and accepted so they don't actually have to take any accountability to make changes in their lives to make their lives actually better happy fatty make a funny they would rather sit in a sad lazy pool of victimhood than do anything to make themselves better because it's apparently easier so men do not be sad that the normies and the Raging leftists and even the fake leftist writers have excluded you from this movement you are much better off guess they've earned each other's respect the muscles did the talking for them if a woman tries to tell you that you are a fat phobic misogynist because you like hitting the gym or try to normalize your Healthy behavior and say that you're just so beautiful when you're unhealthy that is the indication that you need to move on that is a red flag guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "Dwse37MKD10": "welcome back to another episode of off the clock I have done some videos where I have searched myself on Reddit and Tick Tock I've read the comments I don't know if I've reacted to one of those profiles where it's like celebrity info who's Brett Gilbert those are like wildly wrong just first and foremost I think one of them still says that I'm 38 years old promise I'm not 38 years old but I have never really done a full Google search of myself so my team went ahead and pulled some of the most Googled questions about me and we're gonna see what they are Bobby bring on the questions [Music] what is Brett Cooper's job that's a really good question I actually ask myself that daily me and my team we really have no idea because we do a show and then sometimes we're in a studio doing this sometimes we're taking photos um what else do we do it really is well often I'm laughing I'm like this can't really be a job but I also say that because I have so much fun and so like I am a content creator I host a show but I also love what I do so it doesn't feel like a job in many senses and I'm very lucky to have that what is Brett Cooper's age I'm 21. I just turned 21. contrary to popular belief I am not a 38 year old cage fighter named Brett Cooper there is one of those hopefully we'll do a video with him soon so people get confused I get DMS so people are like you can't be in your mid-30s you don't look like you're lying what is Brett Cooper's real name Brett is actually my real name what is my net worth I would love to know that also the net worth things are very confusing I actually have a friend who's an actress and she did a bunch of Disney and Nickelodeon shows she's pretty successful as like a child actor she's still working and we were Googling her net worth at one point and I think Google said that she was worth like 10 million dollars and she looked at me and she was like where is the money I have I really have no idea once I figure that out I won't let you know but I'll figure it out myself what does visit Brett Cooper Drive I drive a gas guzzling SUV I've considered getting a Tesla number one because I am scared or just like an electric car because going to gas stations these days it's a little sketch I feel like I put in the nozzle and then I like immediately jump back in my car and I'm like holding my gun like oh my God just I mean it's just it's a sketchy world out there guys I'm being honest but also I can't even remember to charge my airpods so I think I would be in a predicament because every morning I would wake up and forget to charge the damn car so I stood with the gas guzzlers I like being lifted I don't like being the smallest person on the road if a Toyota Camry Rams into me I want it to be their problem not mine that's the gist what did Red Cooper act in well you can go to IMDb and you can look for yourself I did theater when I was first starting acting so I did a bunch of you know Regional and professional Productions my first job was actually in Opera with the Atlanta Symphony and Opera which is not on IMDb but that's a fun fact I did a show for Fox I've done a show for Paramount it was the remake of Heather's um Gordon we're Gibbon's life on normal street I've done a bunch of indie films and short films and that sort of thing it's all over them I spent 10 years doing it and it was a good time okay what is Ricky were famous for um I don't know I don't know it's funny some people come up to me on the street and they're like you're the tick tock girl and I'm like oh that's great I went to UCLA to become a tick tock girl and then other people are like oh you host the political podcast so I I think it's all over the map just because I do have kind of different audiences on all the different social platforms which is cool because I'm reaching more people which is nice to know that I'm impacting you know in that way but it also makes it so that I don't really know if there's a general consensus of what I'm known for but I guess the comment section where did Brett go to school I was homeschooled well okay let's backtrack I went to public elementary school kindergarten through third grade then I was homeschooled by my mother um middle school high school Range I started going to a private online school where my curriculum was still designed by my mom and but I had like teachers grading it then in ninth grade I was worried that I was missing out on the public high school experience because I had watched some movies and TV shows I was like I want to see a guy in a letterman jacket I want to dance through the Halls news flash it's not like High School Musical at all I hated it I only did that for one year and then I started homeschooling again and then I did dual enrollment at a community college in Los Angeles and so I graduated very early got my associate's degree at the same time that I graduated high school and then I transferred into UCLA basically as a junior and went there and then graduated in 2021. and then I went to UC Berkeley for a business program and I was supposed to go to law school and then I withdrew during the orientation because I realized I did not want to be an attorney but I was supposed to go to University of Idaho's um program and do a dual JD MBA program okay is record Mormon I am not no I've never even been to Utah that's a bad thing that was probably people are gonna be upset of that uh that's the first thing that came to my mind no but I love Mormons they're cool all right is Brad Cooper related to Ben no I'm not I think I probably added to some confusion because I did a tick tock the other day where I made a joke about it people were like I knew it it's and I said in the caption it's a joke but no people didn't realize that until maybe two weeks to be working here and I remember Jeremy boring came out of his office at one point he just looked at me and he was like yep I see it I have no idea when we hired you but yeah it's kind of a conspiracy theory at this point spread Cooper pregnant I hope not no I am not there's no way that that would be possible at this point okay uh is Brett Cooper married no I am not what yeah Reagan just told me that not only do people ask if I'm married and if I'm pregnant apparently people think I have a child my only child is my crusty white dog Brad Gilbert Twitter yes I do have a Twitter I don't really know how to use Twitter that's the thing I use it for Content but I have never really cracked what to tweet in the twitterverse so I see my follower account increase as I get more well known and the pressure that increases on me I feel like Brett you have to be funny you got to be tweeting things so really I just sit there and I retweet and I laugh at videos one day I'll figure it out maybe I'll be a really really hysterical person on Twitter but I also think I talk too much like I'm just rambling they did not tell me what to say for this video I'm just like spewing words my mom always said that I could talk to a tree like she would just set me up in front of things and I would just blabber I think that Twitter it constricts me a little too much I guess now there really isn't as much of a word count like they've expanded it and I could just do a bunch of like I could make a long thread still I prefer to speak rather than type so I guess that's why I have a show moving on particular YouTube I do in fact have a YouTube channel it's called the comment section with recover you can go check it out you're probably on the channel right now watching this video so you should subscribe and like and ring that notification Bell so you never miss a comment section or Instagram I also have that we're currently working on upping my Instagram game uh my social media team told me that I needed to work on that because prior to coming to daily wire really all that I posted were pictures of my dog and things that I was eating and so I'm working on you know elevating the brand I truly I am like the worst person to be an influencer because I don't take photos of myself when I'm out I don't really care when my little timer goes off it says like you've reached your daily limit like after work I will actually turn it off um so I'm trying to change that because now it is my job I guess we're going back to the first question what is my job it's that okay Fred Cooper height I am somewhere in between five eight and five nine depending on how great my posture is on the given day and the shoes that I am wearing I think I'm like a little bit above five eight normally but just depends in my hair like how much the humidity has impacted my hair okay when was Brett Cooper born I was born on October 12 2001. I was born after 9 11. which shocks a lot of people I was born the same year was it the same year that Ocarina of Time came out no no Ocarina of Time is way older than me there was some video game that came out that my producer sheller was like you were born the same years that I'm so old I don't remember what it is though and I thought that it was asking where was I born but this is just a fun fact I was born in Bellingham Washington because my family was living on an island off the coast of Washington at the time so that's fun who is Brett Cooper related to yeah I'm related to Al Gore I'm like his 13th like removed cousin or something like that but I am in fact related to him I am also related to crap I might blanking out on This Woman's name there is a woman she was on the cover of Playboy she and her husband had sex on the capitol steps and caused like a whole political Scandal she is now an heiress or some kind of Duchess in Italy she's also a cousin of mine that's who I'm related to and then my parents that's pretty simple I think they're asking this question because you think I'm related to Ben Shapiro but I'm not uh bringing it back to that question again after Jeremy boring said wow you look like each other Ben's parents came into the office and they both stood in front of me and we're like yeah you could be one of our children I was like well if I hear it from you then it's got to be accurate I really still don't see it other than the dark eyebrows and the fact that we have similar political views so it's probably it but either way I promise I'll clear the air we are not related and we're not the same person even though a lot of people think that we are a deep fake so hopefully that clears up some of your burning questions that you all have been Googling if you have any other questions drop them in the comments maybe we'll do another q a video soon thanks for watching before you though make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribed to this Channel and ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "S37_2BvNuzg": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I saw a post this morning from Libs of tick tock and I was just cackling at it and reading the comments and then I realized I really have not talked about the education system in a while I think most of you guys know I was homeschooled for most of my life but even though the bulk of my education was homeschooled I've basically done everything I did a charter Magnet School I've done public school I did a private online school the only thing I really didn't do was boarding school which my brothers did so we have experience with that literally been all over the map and I still advocate for homeschooling for many reasons which we are going to talk about today so I decided to do a bit of a public education School compilation and with the help of Libs of tick tock I pulled that content in literally five minutes flat because these teachers for some god-awful reason decide to put all of their personal life and their political agendas online so that we know what our children and my future children are getting into when you enroll them in public education so we're going to talk about that today but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com if you want to check out my merch collection all right so this is the post that I saw this morning it says this looks like an ad for homeschooling it is a classroom that has no desks in it but there is a trans Pride something flag a BLM flag I don't want to know what else there is in the classroom it looks sad the fluorescent lighting is depressing it is an ad for homeschooling especially because I spent most of my life on my couch with a beautiful view of Appalachia doing my awful Saxon Math homework I would much rather be there than in this classroom so anyway that is the post that sparked all of this so we're just going to start off I just want to show you some of these videos because I mean lives of tick tock has been around for probably over a year now I would say like a year and a half and the content is just not ending and it kind of works out for us because these teachers have not learned that when they put this type of content out on the internet people are going to see it they're going to be reprimanded and then they have the gall to be so offended like oh why how did you're not supposed to find that video then we're gonna find it anyway and we're gonna get you fired because you are a freak so anyway we're gonna start off today with a teacher that is very into farting I've had a lot of jobs before I started working at a school and one of which was working in a factory um a pastry Factory and it was like 10 to 12 hour days of just like a lot of emotional and mental abuse and well I got pretty mentally ill I'm pretty tired and pretty sick of it and I just started like whenever I had a fart I just fart all over the pastries like it was so loud in there you couldn't hear and so I just farted on so many pastries and if you live around here and um have done me wrong you've probably ate my farts and that feels pretty good so she literally just said if you live around here you might have eaten my farts or whatever what's in there so you did not stop this after the bakery how do you know that people have done this are you just walking around farting on things all day now like you learned this while working at the bakery Factory but now you're just going and farting on people's sandwiches maybe oh this kid was an  to me in classic let me just go right on his bologna sandwich these people are so unstable she got mentally ill having to work in a factory and her way of coping was not leaving getting a new job maybe going on a walk getting some sunshine maybe seeing a therapist but instead her tactic was to fart on the pastries that unassuming customers who she never interacted with were going to have to eat because of the horrors of her environment and apparently that went so well that now she just walks around doing it everywhere to anybody who's wronged her like these poor customers they're just trying to enjoy their little Debbies and suddenly they're opening up the box and your farts are wafting out at them but

privatizing education by now I don't know what to tell you you'll keep getting this though yeah so what many people don't realize is that public education is a very new phenomenon not even been around 100 years this is very new we can we can easily roll this back guys so we would just get the government to do it funky pants some Twitter account said this is how Lacroix is made sparkling water Essence with natural flavor I've heard that a lot but I don't think I ever want to drink a Lacroix again now that I know the people in factories might actually be doing that that's horrifying somebody else said the act of doing that is insane but it's arguably more insane to go out on your own free will and tell people you did this not long after the fact and pretty much see no issue with it I mean you could basically say that about any of these videos I'm going to show you or any video that these deranged teachers Post online it's like you have no problem posting and talking about this kind of behavior because you think that you are Untouchable you are unrepromandable because we live in a society that is like lifting you up that is supporting your political agenda like that is how far we have fallen here's another teacher who is reading one of those classic politically charged children's books to his class but there's an important Nuance to this I have a quick gender inclusive tip to share with you all for elementary school teachers so check this out when reading picture books like this beautiful picture book called my name is a song it can be easy to look at illustrations and assume gender so challenge those thoughts within yourself and challenge them when you're conversing with students for example in the very first page of this book we just get an illustration we don't know the character's name we don't know their pronouns and so it could be easy to make assumptions about gender when you fear feel yourself doing that simply use they them pronouns or say things to your class like I'm not sure of their gender so I'm going to use a gender neutral pronoun like they them at least with fourth graders they pick up on this quickly and they also will use that same skill when they're reading it's very very cool to see laughs so this is not even a book about gender you are just admitting that you are inserting this gender ideology these pronouns the non-binary stuff into any possible Avenue which we already knew but now you're admitting it on camera and now this commenter pointed out something that I thought was really important it's what I picked up on first is fourth grade children are nine or ten the books I read at that age had very little to no pictures whatsoever somebody else replied and said yeah the Amazon page for the book says that it is intended for preschool to grade three students so either his students can't actually read at a fourth grade level and he's trying to compensate or he just doesn't care and wants to push his agenda why are you reading 10 year olds a picture book and making it about gender I mean it could be any of those options because I mean have you seen literacy right in California I mean for anywhere in this country for that matter that itself without even talking about politics should be enough to say wow we need to overhaul this education system something needs to be changed because we are funneling money into it and these kids are graduating with the worst literacy rate we have seen in years still can't read that should be evidence enough but I think the political stuff is really getting people over the edge somebody else said my kid is wearing a body cam when he goes to school wouldn't that be a bad thing wouldn't that be a bad thing whatsoever I know that there were a lot of people who were talking about putting cameras in classrooms and teachers lost their about it because they wanted privacy but these days not the worst idea here is another pronoun infused teacher we're not done guys I know you're cringing or not here we go oh this one they all have these glasses do they all decide to go out and buy these at the same time together I feel like I've seen like 50 videos at this point of these teachers wearing the pride glasses all right here we go educator here and I want to let you know what's going on in our state in regards to LGBT policy or getting new information from the state level from Governor Younkin and his supporters that we have to amend our policies at the school district level to align with his new plan to try to give parents more rights in education and that sounds nice but it's also ultimately going to hurt kids because it's going to cause Educators to not be able to use the correct name and pronouns that students are telling us to use with them it's going to require us to go to parents to get approval before we can use the correct pronouns and that's really going to hurt kids and unsupported families and supportive environments we also have to amend our policies to no longer allow students to play sports or go to the bathroom with their gender and said go to the one that matches their gender at Birth so keep watching what's going on in Virginia we're fighting oh my God the audacity that parents would be involved in their child's education in their personal life in their mental well-being in their gender identity the gall you would have to inform parents about something they love the fact that for years now they have been able to go behind parents backs not tell them anything not involve the parents whatsoever with any of these huge decisions without any consequences whatsoever because it has been legal and it has been allowed it's even been encouraged in these school districts God forbid junkan says hey let's have parents be involved in their children's education I also love the fact when she was like we're going to give parents more rights I know that might sound like a good thing but it's not more rights the child is a minor the parents have all the rights I know you think you can raise these children in your classrooms you cannot it is still the parent's responsibility as arrogant as you might be somebody commented and said I remember when teachers couldn't even give students a cough drop without the parents consent somebody replied to that and said when I was in high school I got in trouble for giving another girl a Tylenol for menstrual pain but nowadays I'd probably get in trouble for not giving a boy one yeah that's actually pretty accurate and that's sad this one this guy's doing some sort of trend foreign [Music] very serious question for all these teachers do you do anything except think about gender identity and your own sexuality and the sexuality of the children you're teaching because it seems like that's all you post about that's all you want to talk about that's all you want to make your curriculum about that's all you want to do Tick Tock dance is about maybe actually focus on improving literacy right to teaching the math teaching them science there's a way to respect and make your students feel safe without involving their gender and sexuality if you have a fourth grade class I don't need you to be talking to them about whether they are gay or straight give them a book without pictures in it so that they can actually learn to read it's really quite simple somebody replied and posted this tweet and said technically I'm not misgendering people they misgendered themselves I hadn't thought about it that way before but you know what actually quite accurate somebody else said social media was a mistake yeah most days I really think it was but you know what if there was no social media I would not have the show and I would not be able to talk to you guys every single day and demonstrate the chaos that goes on in schools now the craziest thing to me about all of this is that these videos that I just showed you these were all posted and found my lips of tick tock in the last three days I have not gone through months of content to try to find these oh these teachers they readily post these daily because they think that they are protected and they are Untouchable they have not learned after over a year of lives of tick tock exposing them getting teachers fired for being freaks they still have not learned I actually really love seeing them freak out about what is happening at the state level with Governors like Junkin who are Drawing the Line in the Sand saying no your shenanigans are over it's time for you to respect parents it's time for you to get back to actually doing what you were hired to do I can't believe it's taken us this long to get back to that but it's exciting it's important and I'm excited to see more meltdowns from teachers because it gives me content for ages but back to the point that really should be driven home if you have children if you are going to have children if you have young people in your life and you are not thinking about the education that they are receiving if you are not actively involved with your child's education and the teachers that they are interacting with with their schools whether you have pulled them out whether you've put them in a private school whatever you're doing now is the time like the time was yesterday the time is now start whenever because these people are taking liberties with your children it's not right and you need to step in okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "E-Ewh4_XJ9c": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper now I haven't touched on this on the show yet but I know everybody is talking about it there was a shooting in Colorado at an lgbtq club last week it was incredibly tragic and my heart goes out to everyone who was involved unsurprisingly it has been made political within an instant the sides are fighting at each other which always breaks my heart because our focus should be on the victims it should be on their families and how to help them but sadly that has not stopped people from pointing fingers at each other especially the unhinged screeching women at the view let's see what they had to say about it and someone came to that place I don't know that they hide behind religion because I said this on this show once before Jesus would be the Grand Marshal at the pride parade I don't mean about gay people I mean in every argument we have but here's your weaponized religion but it's wrong if you're so afraid why are you going over there yeah if they scare you so much leave them below when stuff scares me I leave it alone if I don't want to be bothered I don't go there see that's the problem you don't want to just have your feelings you want everybody else to join you and you know what you can you can scream you can cuss you can do all the things that you say but you know what gay people are here they're not going anywhere there is nothing you can like seals it's Clockwork you know you can yell and scream but you know as as the Lord as everybody was talking about you know made in God's image yep made in God's image there are no but except for there's none of that no keep that in mind when you're trying to figure out where you stand as a human being you know I actually really like Whoopi's hoodie in that I like her over it I wish I could wear that I don't like what she's over and she probably doesn't like what I'm over but I would absolutely rock that hoodie but all that aside will be you're saying this about the suspect in the Colorado shooting saying that he is transphobic saying that he went to this club as a hate crime to hurt these people I feel like you'd be interested to know that his attorney just confirmed that the suspect is apparently non-binary and uses they them pronouns and wants to go by mix instead of Mister now I'm not sure whether this is actually true or not or whether this is some sort of legal strategy but I would love to see them try to spin that fact for their own agenda I would sit here with a bowl of popcorn and love to watch that now personally I do not give a about that man's gender he committed an awful heinous crime and he deserves to be punished regardless of whatever his gender ideology is do not care but moving on let's hone in on what said at the very beginning of that clip because I think it was kind of glossed over this is from good old Sunny hosting I don't know that they hide behind religion because I said this on this show once before Jesus would be the Grand Marshal at the pride parade okay really I do not think that would be the case especially not in 2022's Pride but okay count on The View to give us the most awful takes day in and day out it's honestly kind of admirable and a bit impressive that they continue to do that I would be exhausted I don't know how they pull those things out of their ass the replies were everything I hoped for though somebody said I am more and more convinced that Hosten has a pull string behind her back and when it's her turn to talk somebody gives it a yank and she says whatever bizarre thing they put in her voice box before the show it's kind of like the Ellen DeGeneres skit where she would send people out with like ear pieces in and they would be required to say exactly what Ellen said in her ear like Adele did a bunch of them I remember one where Michelle Obama was at a Walgreens I loved those videos I hate that Ellen DeGeneres is now like a raging piece of but anyway I grew up enjoying those and that's kind of what that comment reminds me of somebody else says the hypocrisy is deafening if they don't understand Christians why don't they just leave us alone yeah they leave every other religion alone actually they don't they just hate God basically on a whole they do not respect religion whatsoever unless it is one of their Twisted weird worshiping grass and crystals like thank God there are companies like nimi that actually still promote Faith and family

cynical philosopher don't I somebody else said if it came down to that or watching an episode of this show I believe you would I don't know because of how terrible the view is it's almost like comedy I don't hate watching it because of the absurd things that they say you can't even take it seriously and the people who do take it seriously I worry about your brain functioning I truly do I feel like this was a show that was just like designed for Biden I know more think of myself as being as old as I am than fly somebody else said a live view of Jesus watching the world accurate it's like that uh Matthew McConaughey Jesus is that the meme see Matthew McConaughey right where he's like that one sort of reminds me of but back to the point this whole like Jesus is a gay icon thing is not some new phenomenon now thanks to Sour Patch Lids who is the former producer of timcast I was informed about something that the National Church of Iceland did back in 2020. here it is there's a picture of it Church depicts Jesus as genderqueer with breasts and beard here they are frolicking yay with the children and the disciples somebody replied and said bro I know that God promised not to flood the world ever again but now we really need it to happen yeah literally please now this iconic gay publication called outspoken wrote this article that I screenshotted but here's what they had to say now according to them Couture I hope I'm not butchering his name Peter George Martin a media representative for the Church of Iceland suggested that there was a need for the church to drum up various forms of Jesus in an effort to advocate for diversity adding in one sense we see a Jesus who has breasts and a beard we're trying to embrace society as it is we have all sorts of people and we need to train ourselves to talk about Jesus as being all sorts in this context no you don't Jesus is inclusive as he is you don't need to give him boobs to drive the point home that's blasphemy literally they continued on and said especially because it's really important that each and every person sees themselves in Jesus so that we don't stagnant too much that's the essential message so this is okay it is okay that Jesus has a beard and rest that is a literal quote from the media representative what no they continued on and said that the same artist who created the genderqueer Jesus is now turning to work on a new marketing campaign that will show a number of different personifications of Christ according to reports including one where he is advocating for environmental issues I hope he looks like Greta funberg features like the Jesus version my mind went to a terrible place that I'm not even gonna tell you this literally is a common thing and I'm sure many of you know that but I just went down to Rabbit Hole today because as I was on Twitter looking at this genderqueer Jesus and looking at a bunch of these comments I stumbled upon this Bible and I put it in quotes that I'm using the word very lightly because this is not a Bible this is on Amazon it is called the queer gospel an alternative telling of the Bible and it's oh it's on sale right now in 11 you guys can get it but I have to read you the description okay in the beginning God created the queer tribes of the Earth this alternative telling of the Bible stands in celebration of all Queer human beings everywhere sharing the truth at the basis of any spirituality is love God created queer people first and women before all others it was a straight man who first ate fruit from the Tree of Phobos starting a generational cycle of phobia and Hate it is no longer the Garden of Eden it is just probably the garden of phobia and hate and bigotry the church was founded as a societal tool to control the masses teaching people to be innately ashamed and afraid of their own basic Natures in an act of infinite love God sent their only child to cleanse they oh it's a goddess of they as well that's great God sent their only child to cleanse the Earth of confusion and fear Jesus the genderqueer Messiah has come to save the straight Foams from their wicked and hateful ways well Jay's you and their disciples succeed can they bring love back to Earth and save the straight tribes from their original phobia I hate people I'm not even actively religious and I know that this is offensive now I wanted to believe that this was some kind of joke this is a real author and you know I'm grateful that there is Free Speech in this world so that I can laugh at this kind of stuff but at the same time this is just very sad and it is just very indicative of how far we have fallen as a society that this is not only just deemed acceptable but the people praise this seek this out and truly worship this kind of God I mean it's almost as ridiculous as people worshiping the environment as some sort of deity Greta thundberg is not here to save you genderqueer Jesus with boobs and a beard not here to save you you people need to pull your heads out of your ass okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you

trick-or-treating I really haven't done much in recent years just because I don't really love going out or going to Big parties that's kind of what you did in college and especially in Los Angeles but this year I'm gonna go over to a friend's house I'm gonna do something and guys you picked out the costume I am going to be Kim Possible that was decided on my all access live stream this week so get excited for that thank you all for helping me figure that out because I had no idea what was going on but it is a good time I enjoy it it's a fun time of the year we get to dress up and enjoy ourselves meanwhile the social justice Warriors get to cry about all of our fun costumes and that is what we're going to talk about today but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection in case you are thinking oh Brett I haven't thought about whether my costume is offensive or not don't worry I've pulled a few tick tocks I have pulled a few resources to make sure we are educating ourselves about the possibility that we could harm people with our fun let's just start off with these since Halloween is coming up I thought I'd make a video of costumes that you should not wear this woman has been sexualized enough they're both in life and death you don't need to do this you don't the fact that this is even that is out of stock I like the like very dramatic like Sinister music this pains me to me Cleopatra I have been Cleopatra this one I've this one if you don't understand why you shouldn't be wearing this or why you shouldn't use that word you need to look up Romani and you look it up on Tick Tock and you look up up on Google you just need to do your research okay I was definitely a gypsy like four years ago so like just um just don't and if you can't stop yourself oh that's nice well she seems Pleasant I have not been Marilyn Monroe but that was actually an option last year I have been a Native American I was Pocahontas I think I have been Cleopatra or something like that a long time ago and I definitely was a gypsy four or five years ago so I hope that girl loves me apparently I am in her eyes now there was another video don't worry this one actually has over a million likes this was the biggest one I saw 1.2 million likes foreign oh my God this is the Moana dude [Music] okay that one [Music] that's kind of funny [Music] I like that one some of them I could see I don't really know why somebody would want to be 911 for Halloween I don't think that's something we really need to discuss it's just kind of like why that's not even fun that one maybe not just on a broad level but everything else like just stop being so freaked out about everything and in case you don't feel properly squawked at I pulled an infographic for all of us what the hell is this because we know that's the left's favorite tactic start off with are you planning on painting your face black to mimic a skin tone and if it says yes that's called blackface don't do that then we go no are you are you Hitler are you anything that has to do with Hitler and if you say no then you can move on anyway it goes on for ages I'm pretty sure it's satire but in 2022 you literally cannot tell whether anything is satire or whether it's real this was the funniest one I saw that was on Twitter but there were some other ones that were very legit and were just as ridiculous but somebody commented on this and said I started to read that and then I just decided to go as a bigot same that's good another person said I have an easier one if you are straight CIS and white your costume is offensive and you need to do better wow so true snaps for that I'm just gonna sit this one out guys I'm just gonna go home and read Maya anti-racist baby book it's gonna be great really think about everything I've done this year there are a few specific costumes that are you know kind of relating to 2022 that are really on the No-No list and they have to do with Jeffrey Dahmer and anything from the Amber Heard Johnny Depp trial now I first saw the Jeffrey Dahmer uproar went Olympic gymnast Simone biles posted on Twitter and told her followers that she did not want to see any Jeffrey Dahmer costumes this literally trended for an entire day like last night they wrote an article about this one tweet here's the post when Simone biles blash Jeffrey Dahmer costumes ahead of Halloween and then here's her tweet I'm just gonna go ahead and say it put the Jeffrey Dahmer costumes back in the closet we ain't having it and if you don't really know who Jeffrey Dahmer is he was a serial killer he targeted men he was gay there was that whole uproar because Netflix released a documentary about it and they put lgbtq as a tag everybody freaked out because they were like don't say that a serial killer is gay anyway there's been a a lot of Hub up about it but this was a very very publicized case the documentary Series has been insanely popular everybody's been talking about it it has become entertainment so obviously they're going to be Halloween costumes about it it's making everybody very angry other people jumped in on Twitter and said dear white people you cannot be Jeffrey Dahmer for Halloween and somebody replied and said actually we can because we're right but we can't be is O.J Simpson because he was a black murderer okay another person said they can be whoever they choose to be another person said imagine glorifying a serial killer and someone who literally ate people oh so did Anthony Hopkins my girl have you ever seen a scary Halloween costume like I don't even like scary movies I don't like gory things I have been chased by weird people in scary costumes on Halloween and it kind of freaked me out but I'm not gonna go home and cry about it because that's literally what people do on Halloween and I'm not trying to get into a huge debate about you know the morals and the ethics of Halloween and you know dressing up as all the scary stuff it's just kind of at this point in 2022 it's a normal thing that people do so you're being very selective with your outrage about what is acceptable they're also real mad about Amber Heard and Johnny Depp and I know that because my friend and her friend dressed up as the trial and basically got canceled online here's the Reel that she posted on her Instagram and I have permission to do this don't worry she's very excited about it I dressed up as the Johnny Depp trial for Halloween that's my friend as Johnny that's cat I had this [\u00a0__\u00a0] sheet a mega pint of red wine it's just iconic they're the judge I poured myself a large glass of wine right I thought it necessary one of your good friends that you've taken drugs with before is Marilyn Manson right yes we've taken we've drank together like this is fantastic it is so well executed and it is all perfect for 2022. this was the most talked about event for the entire year the entire country was jumping in on it however the Amber Heard fans have still not let up every once in a while Amber Heard Trends again on Twitter and it's like justice for Amber I hope Amber's okay guys calm down she's off like [\u00a0__\u00a0] in Spain or doing something like leave her alone she's broke probably thinking about the fact that she lied many many times but one of those fan accounts found Kat's video reposted it and said go attack this girl can you believe she's making fun of Amber like this and the comments are just wild here's just a couple somebody said absolutely no class somebody else said obviously you were from the states because that type of stupidity is only found in that garbage can Patriot somebody else said guess who's gonna end up in the framing Amber Heard documentary they'll make in 10 years a hint of these knob heads then there was actually a person with common sense who said hundreds of comments telling you to go to hell yet they are somehow convincing themselves that they are tolerant and that they are loving by defending Amber more power to you Catherine Darnell this backward Society is all bad absolutely correct spot on per usual they are making themselves feel good by ripping into everybody else it's not really how it works guys but the video made its way to Twitter as well a Amber Heard fan account person posted it there and once again her stands found it here's the video and the person tweeted people are dressing up as a woman and the man who abused and raped her and they're so proud of it I don't even know what to say I am so sorry Amber like Amber's not gonna see that Amber does not care actually she probably will see it because on Twitter the only people that can reply to her comments are the people she follows and the only people she follows are Amber Heard fan accounts which is the most narcissistic thing I have ever heard of girl it's not helping your case at all the comments are wild again this person started off strong though with a good comments that Amber deserves this that made the people real angry and then this person screenshotted it and said here they are sending love to a far-right conservative pundit it says what kind of person they are let me get this straight me Far Right angry radical yeah that's the kind of person Kat is because she's friends with me the gall now if you've been watching the channel for a while I think you know my thoughts about the Johnny Depp Amber Her trial I don't need to go into the details I need to go into the nitty-gritty here you can go back and watch those videos if you are interested because I had a hell of a good time covering it but without getting into all of that that trial was turned into entertainment I guarantee there is going to be an O.J Simpson type miniseries that is fictionalized and dramaticized in the next two years like I'm guessing it's already been optioned there was one they've already oh they've already done it this is entertainment similar with Jeffrey Dahmer Netflix turned that into a docu-series both of these trials are in pop culture right now both of them are in the thick of the cultural Zeitgeist so you should not be surprised that people are dressing up as them for Halloween that they are continuing on the entertainment and the spectacle of these cases and I'm saying all this without trying to get into the nitty-gritty and the offensive nature and the seriousness of the trials it's just a matter of fact so stop concerning yourself with it because as an individual there is nothing you can do to change what people are going to dress up as focus on yourself sit down and shut up I don't want to hear it do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that Bell so you never miss an episode", "SrpRs5g8HbY": "welcome back to off the clock y'all i did a quiz last weekend where i figured out whether i am a feminist or not because obviously you can find all the answers to everything on buzzfeed that was a raging success and i appreciated everybody's comments about all the woke quizzes and that sort of thing and apparently a bunch of you went and took the quiz and you did a whole bunch of different answers so it was funny to see what you guys all got so i have another challenge for myself and you this time it is whether we are all gay or not uh so also according to buzzfeed you could not only find out if you are a feminist but you can also figure out if you are gay or not based on this quiz that they created on december 15 2021 a magnificent day in american history uh so i'm going to figure that out for everybody here feel free to follow along i don't know whether this one will be serious or not because some of them are super jokey but i'm just excited to figure out what's going on maybe i'll participate in next year's pride who knows all right let's just go ahead and start so how gay am i finally an answer to the question that has been puzzling you all at this time i have been puzzled how gay am i all right choose a color red blue pink yellow lilac or green i do like lilac that's nice pick your favorite beyonce song oh drunk in love crazy in love ooh crazy in love do you do you enjoy consensual sexual experiences with or feel a sexual attraction to members of the same sex as yourself that's literally the only question that needs to be asked what is what are all the other questions that i'm answering though why put all the other questions in if this is just gonna be number three oh beyonce favorite color do you like same sex experiences uh what no never love you ladies but i'm not interested boy that escalated quickly i mean that really got out of hand fast anyway now we're back to the normal questions what city would you most like to live in new york london paris san francisco tokyo moscow uh definitely not san francisco definitely not new york um why not london why not sure because people in france they scare me a 10 minute what is your favorite drink of choice beer cocktail stout whiskey white wine gin and tonic kobe there's no red wine this is this is terrible my producer loves red wine we're gonna do just cocktail that's fine just to clarify do you like having sex with people of the same sex okay i'm getting it now i'm getting it uh no really no what's your ideal saturday night clubbing until 5am absolutely not dinner and theater quiet drink with friends doing something new house party night in with netflix probably doing something new i'll try and think once oh hang on have you ever felt sexually attracted to somebody of the same sex no which of the u.s presidents do you most identify with barack obama william taft abe lincoln james buchanan jfk ronald reagan hello reagan love you what is your favorite root vegetable oh this is a really important question jerusalem artichoke never heard of that sweet potato i do love sweet potatoes let's do sweet potato if you could pick your ideal partner for a romantic date what qualities would they have they'd be the same sex as me preferably the same sex but not mostly you know just hot don't care about their sex care about wine is that you coffee dates are boring they must be the opposite sexy hear me there we go pick a weather phenomenon oh little fluffy clouds i do like that little happy clouds and you can put as many or as few as you want which sex is craziest oh why am i looking at asses all sexes are sexy stop being a sexiness fascist opposite opposite opposite yeah opposite pick an arbitrary box screw you boxes screw your boxes that's what i want oh dear god a plane leaves new york at 4 15 local time bound for london traveling at 500 miles per hour another plane leaves london at 9 30 local time heading into the opposite direction traveling at 550 miles per hour if they maintain a constant airspeed do you ever want to have sex with somebody of the same sex no storms out of room that's what it says only once i'm mad fool me twice how could you fool me three times you're officially that guy okay you know you know the one i am not gay oh my god it gave me confetti you are not gay you really enjoy having sexual experiences with members of the opposite sex who are attracted both physically and emotionally to people of the opposite sex and are not very keen at all on sexual relations members of the same sex heterosexuality is fun is this like a quiz for the super straight movement do you guys remember that that was the whole thing that's what i feel like i just won right there so in case i was concerned that i might be gay you never know if you're transgender as well and there was also a quiz for that which is a tad more relevant because everybody thinks that i'm the female version of ben shapiro i literally do get comments saying are you trans because you kind of look like ben and you have a male name like did daily wire hire a trans person no no like do i really look that much like a dude my mom once told me that she thought i had higher testosterone but i think it was just because i have three older brothers we're not gonna get into that am i transgender let's take the three minute quiz i was assigned female at birth yes i was what gender do you believe is yours female if everyone referred to you as female how would you feel i would like it very much do you believe that you are transgender not at all do you ever experience gender dysphoria the feeling your internal gender does not match your physical sex not at all are you considering surgery to permanently transition one of the options is of course then why are you taking this quiz i think you already know if you could change your gender from male to female or female to male without any problems but never change it back would you no it's too risky no that's that's the reasoning it's too risky no wait that's weird too risky no i'm fine with what i have that's the response i need what kind of name would you like to be called by if i click unisex are they gonna say i'm non-binary oh good most likely not is what they said you appear to be content with who you are if exploring your gender identity is something that intrigues you go for it what's stopping you and then you can click learn more to learn about if you are transgender i remember being in middle school but i literally took quizzes that were like am i depressed and that kind of thing like do people do the same thing with gender identity i ended up not really being depressed i was just um angry at my parents um i mean i i do wonder if like kids on the internet after seeing all this gender stuff and you know they're scrolling on websites like buzzfeed or you know any of those other i don't even know what size people are on right now tick tock reddit whatever they're scrolling on all these sites and they're sitting around going you know like maybe i am gay maybe i am transgender maybe i am questioning all of this stuff if they go online and they take one of these quizzes yeah it might be a joke it might be all in jest and like people might think that it's harmless but for these kids i don't know maybe maybe i'm overthinking it but there it feels like there could be something semi like sinister about it maybe sinister even is a too harsh for word i don't think that these are necessarily just harmless or jokes if that makes sense i don't know you guys let me know what you think in the comments hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "4yVTJOWnopg": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I am a bit just to put it mildly outraged about this story because we are back with yet another cheating situation apparently the news of this year has been a bunch of husbands cheating on their wives couples breaking up to focus on themselves after 10 years of marriage the whole world is just combusting and apparently nobody cares about commitment anymore but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection I don't know about y'all but the OG years of BuzzFeed YouTube that was like my Heyday online I did not do a bunch of stuff on Reddit or 4chan or you know go on deep Dives on YouTube looking at weird things like literally I was so on the surface that I just sat and would watch hours and hours of clips from the Ellen show and the try guys oh my sweet so my child what do you know all about fear and if you don't know who they are the try guys are four guys they were put together by BuzzFeed they were BuzzFeed producers and they had a YouTube show and then after a few years of huge success with BuzzFeed they all left together and they started their own channel and their own production company called the try guys they have almost 8 million subscribers on YouTube I always enjoyed their videos and I only stopped watching in 2020 when covet happened because they got so political and I knew that they were lib but prior to 2020 they had always stayed Above The Fray they just tried to make people laugh they seem like good guys and then in 2020 it became you know all kovid get vaccinated lgbtq identity crisis like all of this stuff and I was like you know what I just don't want to deal with it so I haven't watched them in a while but this morning I was scrolling on Tick Tock as I often do and I saw this horrific video when we were together so if you don't understand what is happening here that is one of the try guys with his wife Ariel and apparently he has been cheating on her and the photos were just leaked now to set the stage Ned's whole identity for the last 10 years has been being married and loving his wife wife my wife my wife my wife my wife my wife my wife my wife wife when they were still at BuzzFeed he was the only married one and Ariel would come in and be like the mom to all the other guys all the other bachelors and would love on them and he was like I'm older and more mature I met my wife at Yale we're so happy we're going to have babies his whole thing was being married and I love my wife and it started out very authentic in the earlier years like he was just so giddy and happy to be married to this like blonde bombshell but they definitely went to commercial like they suddenly had huge Target brand deals and they made cookbooks and she had like a wife and mom podcast and she was featured more with the other try wives is what they would call them and he blew up everything for his producer the girl that he cheated on aerial with is his much younger producer who is also engaged you what there's some info on her this is just a clip from one of the try guys videos that she was featured in Andrea I'm an associate producer here at the try guys and a food baby So currently I am engaged very excited we got engaged she already annoys me 2021. we've been together for about 10 and a half years so right before our 10th anniversary he proposed so she has been with this man for 10 years they've been engaged for at this point uh over a year and a half and she has been sleeping with Ned Fulmer who she knew was married that's not some kind of surprise she's like oh I didn't know and obviously we do have to put out there there probably is some weird Power Balance here that is important to disclose because what Ned was doing he could be sued for because he owns part of the try guys and the girl that he was sleeping with was an employee of his so if she got fired she could turn around and sue them the whole thing is a hot mess obviously the internet is losing its mind because for the last 10 years this couple has been a YouTube darling somebody said the hypocrisy of the Ned foamer cheating scandal isn't just that he made my wife his whole personality but that he tried to turn his family into a Lifestyle brand The cookbook the target partnership the DIY decorating stuff making money off of his marriage while cheating absolutely disgusting it's like let me give you my manufactured happy family while I actually don't give a  about her or my kids I'm just gonna turn around and cheat on her while making tons of money making her look like a fool it's disgusting another person said Ned Fulmer from the try guys cheating on his wife after his entire personality for years was loving his wife is the exact reason I do not trust men and you know in the last episode where I talked about Adam Levine cheating on his wife I really tried like come on guys we gotta be better I'm not gonna shame all guys I'm still not going to do that but this story makes it a little harder and it just makes my walls go up a little bit higher because it's like come on man oh man it's just a bit nerve-wracking you know another person said Ned Fulmer is caught cheating on Ariel wife and mother of his two kids at a solo sold out Harry Styles Concert in Madison Square Garden his headline that would have sent me to a facility in 2014. yeah that was their Heyday where we all believed that net and Ariel were forever and the prince and princess of YouTube so he flew to New York with his producer what did they say hey we're gonna go shoot a video when really he's taking her to a Harry Styles country what if Ariel had wanted to go to the Harry Styles concert she's a woman she's a millennial she probably did because everybody loves Harry Styles right now but no she was at home with their two kids while he was making out with this engaged young thing in Madison Square Garden another person said Adam Levine John Mulaney and now Ned Fulmer from try guys making the Unholy Trinity of Saltine to make their brand about loving their wife and still cheat yeah so we already talked about Adam Levine who did all of his songs about you know waking up on Sunday morning loving his wife then did his whole girls like you music video where he was you know surrounding his wife with love and joy making themselves into the perfect family John mullaney the Beloved stand-up comedian also left his wife of many years and then turned around and like a month later had a new family and had gotten Olivia Munn pregnant I believe it's Olivia Munn and all of his stand-up specials were about his wife and how much he loved her in their marriage like what is going on here is now saying you love your wife a red flag for guys it's just oh God this whole society right now it's just dumpster fire I saw another comment on one of these videos and somebody said their social media manager quitting last week and making passive aggressive videos since then is kind of suss so obviously I had to go find these we're getting into the back story a little bit here they're well known social media manager who has almost 500 000 followers on Tick Tock quit on Friday and then posted this on his page [Music] that is just so salty and amazing it is the best exit of any social media manager I have ever seen he said good morning to everybody except Adam Levine John Mulaney and dot dot and then he Zooms in on Ned and Ariel's cookbook that is the only confirmation that we need if nothing else was confirmed that gives us some insight right there so they had to know before all of this happened this weekend because obviously this guy quit on Friday and posted it you can also tell that the try guys knew because they started cutting Ned out of content and promotions back on September 2nd that was the last time that he was featured in anything that they have released he was removed from their show intro very quietly he was edited from a couple of videos that people knew that he had filmed with him already he's not featured in their new merch collection they have been preparing for this for the last month so all that being said after this story blew up the pictures were leaked and by the way this is a whole other story we don't really need to get into right now but it is alleged that Alexandria she's the mistress that her fiance actually leaked the photos that they were sent to him and then he posted them on Reddit maybe to get this whole thing to blow up because he thought that they were going to you know get by unscathed I don't really know that is just a theory right now but anyway once all of that happened the try guys the whole company was prepared somebody tweeted and said the try guys dropping Ned vulmer for cheating on his wife and not just automatically sticking by their friend is what we like to see I absolutely agree they posted this and they said Ned fomer is no longer working with the try guys as a result of a thorough internal review we do not see a path forward together we thank you for your support as we navigate this change this is absolutely the right move and not only should they call their longtime friend on his and his disgusting Behavior but as business owners it is absolutely correct that they need to distance themselves from this man because what he did was not only immoral but it was illegal and he put their business and their reputation at risk and of course in classic 2022 fashion Ned and Ariel also made posts on social media using the notes app it's a very normal thing I was kind of bummed because Adam Levine made his statement after I had already released my episode about it but first of all this is what Ariel said thanks to everybody who has reached out to me it means a lot nothing is more important to me in Ned than our family and all we request right now is the respect our privacy for the sake of our kids nice statement very quick and short she's not limited to any of her comments on her posts and so people are just rushing to support her saying you are so amazing we're so sorry that this happened to you we'll respect privacy whatever I'm bitter and so I kind of hate that she said nothing is more important to me and Ned than our family like obviously it's not he would not have cheated on you and left you and your children if family was more important than anything it should just be about you right now which is why now we're going to talk about Ned's statement he said family should have always been my priority but I lost focused and had a consensual workplace relationship consensual workplace relationship I'm sorry for any pain that my actions may have caused the guys and fans of most of all to Ariel the only thing that matters right now is my marriage and my children and that is where I'm going to focus my attention it should have mattered this entire time you're now saying oh well now I was caught so I'm going to focus on my marriage and my kids absolutely not this is almost exactly what Adam Levine posted on Instagram right after he got caught he was like oh I'm so sorry I I was led astray but I'm going to focus on I'm going to focus on my marriage now so just please calm down both of those statements are obviously so scripted and contrived and basically identical to each other it's kind of like the male cheater version of a lib apology tour where they're posting all these videos like I'm so sorry I said something that's like Politically Incorrect like I promise I'm gonna do I'm going to learn and re-educate myself Ned Fulmer and Adam Levine are just doing that to try to save face the entire thing it just bothers me it doesn't make me angry at men specifically because I think that this is indicative of a much broader societal problem I did talk about it during the Adam Levine episode and I'm just going to try to drive it home here we are living in a culture right now that does not value commitment that does not value family and marriage and long-lasting relationships instead we are willing to throw it all away hookup culture is still running rampant and so many things need to change I mean our culture is literally disintegrating right in front of our eyes and it might seem ridiculous to talk about you know celebrity cheating scandals I know the celebrity broke up but they represent what is going on in the underbelly of our culture and our society and as celebrities they inspire people they subconsciously influence and lead us we should not be looking up to them we need to change this at the ground level because this behavior is Despicable and it is not going to create a healthy Society for our future whatsoever guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that

something happening in hollywood maybe a tide is turning i'm not really sure but after 19 years on the air the ellen degeneres show has officially finished [Music] i thought that this had happened a couple of years ago because she kept saying i'm not gonna do it anymore oh i'm gonna end whatever i had no idea i have not watched it in a while as has been the fate with most talk shows both late night and daytime like ellen they became increasingly political over the last couple of years uh ridiculously unfunny and so i stopped watching them but i will say i did love ellen i grew up watching all of the games on her show i loved like when she would make her producer andy go through haunted houses like all of that stuff like i ate it up it was a huge part of my young life so i'm slightly nostalgic but before we get into why this is so interesting make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode because guys this is the important news to be honest i have some nostalgia over this but the general consensus on the internet is that nobody really cares that the show has been canceled which i mean i get because it's been on the air for literally 19 years but i do think it is important to at least have compassion for like her staff and the people that have worked on her show that have had job security for literally 19 years think about what are they going to do next how are they going to get health insurance i actually have an idea for them they should look into crowd health crowd health is the solution to a broken health care system and to be clear crowd health is not health insurance it's better it is a capitalist oriented free market solution where 100 of your monthly contributions go to pay for actual health care costs for you and your fellow members it has no doctor networks no hidden fees no enrollment periods there are no surprises so go to joincrowdhealth.com and use promo code cooper to get a special discount of 99 per month for three months go to joincrowdhealth.com and use promo code cooper if you're out of a job like ellen's employees you might need it the first comment that i saw under this discussing film post somebody who said who cares about this little man it's not wrong also this video this is under the announcement i mean look at these somebody else said i used to pray for times like these somebody else said society right now and they showed a utopia somebody else said ellen degeneres has been telling us that it's her last season for three years now it's giving us closure sale almost go sign from stores that never intend to close i feel like she's gonna come back with a new show on like peacock or something she's gonna go join jen saki she and peppermint patty are gonna have a show an msnbc show called just like ellen and jen ellen's not done she's gonna go do something else but it did crack me up that everybody on the internet was literally like please get off my tv screen i have not cared about you in so long have you ever tried simply turning off the tv sitting down with your children and hitting them of course she had to make her final show semi-political now if you know ellen she had a sitcom for a while and they got taken off the air because they didn't want to like portray uh gayness and her being a lesbian at the time so it was kind of epic she turned around and she just got herself a daytime show she really to her credit revolutionized daytime television she was an icon for many years obviously she has kind of fallen off on the reputation side of things i think it used to be a pretty big get if you were an actor a celebrity to be able to like get on ellen and in the past few years i think it's kind of like they're just doing her a favor it's kind of been like my impression of it but the woman is an icon in hollywood for many many reasons but that's her backstory lots of gayness variety posted this and they said the ellen degeneres show ends after 19 years quote when we started this show i couldn't say gay we all know where this is going does that rhetoric sound familiar i couldn't say gay yeah thoughts out so this is part of her last opening monologue when we started this show i couldn't say gay on the show i was not allowed to say gay i said it at home a lot i you know what are we having for our gay breakfast or past the gay salt has anyone seen the gay remote things like that but we couldn't say uh gay i couldn't say we because that implied that i was with someone uh sure couldn't say wife and that's because it wasn't legal for gay people to get married and now i say wife all the time it was just a lot of gayness and basically making uh very vague political statements the people in the comments picked up on that immediately the first one said and now in florida you can't say gay that didn't i warn you guys and it's kind of iconic because there's a comment that's right underneath it and this other guy says now none of us can stand the word which is how i feel because it seems that since desantis has banned the word gay we've just seen more of it oh be nice great times all of this that's kind of like your overall backstory about ellen but there's another layer here that i think she would like us all to forget and that is that in 2020 she faced some toxic work environment allegations some ex-employees came forward who had worked on her show and said that she was a terrible boss that uh working on the show was like a horrific experience all of that the show took a little break they took a hiatus and she did her whole thing where she one apologized for her whiteness and all the blm stuff in the summer and then she wrote this open letter to her employees in 2020 basically doing the leftist you know bowing to the allegations saying like i've grown i can't believe that this happened i had no idea i'm going to be actively anti-toxic that kind of thing and then at the end she basically just wrapped it up by saying i'm proud of the work that we do i want everybody at home to love our show and i want everyone who makes it to love working on it again i'm so sorry to anyone who didn't have that experience if not for covet i would have done this in person and i can't wait to be back on our stage and see you all then stay safe and healthy love ellen so then i think she thought that it might all go away no it did not people had not forgotten about the fact that the woman who says be kind to one another that's how she answers show every single day thank you and be kind to one another the woman who had preached about kindness who had given off this air of like of love that oh it's just so fun to work here and i'm the most wonderful person in hollywood had faced these allegations people were not gonna let that fly so when the show came back she had to address it i am that person that you see on tv i am also a lot of other things i sometimes i get sad i get mad i i get anxious i get frustrated i get impatient and i am working on all of that i am a work in progress ma'am you're 60 years old when you get sad and anxious at 60 years old you are supposed to have the emotional maturity to deal with it and not be a toxic boss you're supposed to actually live in accordance to your be kind to one another and you deal with it because you are an adult what just an exceptional display of like victim blaming like oh it could never have been me like i'm just going to evade all responsibility but guys she's a leftist like that's what they do they're unprincipled and they evade responsibility all right that's not all she said i know that i'm in a position of privilege and power and i realize that with that comes responsibility and i take responsibility for what happens at my show we have had a lot of conversations over the last few weeks about the show our workplace and what we want for the future we have made the necessary changes and today we are starting a new chapter oh that's just lazy writing it's literally like the white liberal complex i must admit my privilege i must admit that i am just inherently flawed i couldn't actually take responsibility for being an but because i'm so privileged and i'm just oh god i just can't take responsibility but i'm going to fix it all it's a spiel that we have heard time and time again anytime anybody gets cancelled anytime anybody gets caught in the middle of a social justice warrior you know firestorm it's what they do [Music] i really have no idea what went on behind the scenes it was a lot of back and forth so we really have no idea and i don't think that she deserves to be canceled but i think it's important to look at her response which is the most conventional fluffy meaningless thing i've ever seen it's exhausting when you see it on social media literally every single day people saw right through it obviously somebody said she created the toxicity and wants to play victim yes to all of you who have watched this show and supported me thank you so much for this platform and i hope that what i've been able to do in the last 19 years has made you happy and that i was able to take a little bit of pain away from a bad day or anything you're going through and i hope i've been able to inspire you to make other people happy and to do good in the world to feel like you have a purpose and i've said it before but i'll say it again if i've done anything in the past 19 years i hope i've inspired you to be yourself your true authentic self and by opening your heart and your mind you're going to be that much more compassionate and compassion is what makes the world a better place thank you so much for being on this journey with me i feel the love and i send it back to you somebody follows up that clip by saying yeah your staff sure knows about your authentic self give me a break ellen this was actually my favorite comment on this youtube video about her coming back and addressing it the one big issue i have with ellen's many apologies is that she never takes responsibility for her own behavior she takes responsibility for the show and the staff she hires but never for her own behavior she never admits that she treated her staff poorly she never admits that she was aware of the problems on set she acts as if her only crime was ignorance to the bad things occurring what she really needs to say is i'm sorry i'm sorry to the people i hurt i like to think that i'm a good boss but i know that there have been times when i haven't been i can't make up for the pain i cause but i want all of the staff to know that i've heard you and i understand that i'm going to be better yes that is the most simple thing the fact that taking responsibility that apologizing saying hey i messed up and i miss stepped and something went wrong is such a foreign concept to people these days is horrifying and i do think that it contributes to a lot of issues in our society right now a lot of things between the left and the right can be boiled down to one value's responsibility and one does not one is principled and one is not and i'm not saying that you know every person on the right side of the political aisle is perfect and is the most moral and you know consistent but i like to think that the values that we attempt to follow align themselves with personal responsibility and principled behavior ellen is just a perfect example of how liberals act and how they attempt to sidestep every issue and expect the world to just immediately forgive them when really they're not even apologizing for anything guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "eJuH4GTMyCM": "welcome to brett cooper off the clock this is the comment section adjacent my version of nick at night after dark whatever it is i have extra time during my day and there's more stuff on the internet that i want to talk about i was on buzzfeed which is just a hell hole of a site to be honest and i was looking at some of their quizzes as one does and there are so many sjw ones that i felt like i should just dive in and really take account of myself do a reality check see you know how woke i really am this is actually from 2016. this was ahead of its progressive time this is how much of a feminist are you i don't consider myself a feminist in like the modern third way feminist you know idea but if we were talking about the og feminists people who actually believe that the gender should have you know equality then i would say i'm a feminist so let's see what this quiz is all about what wave of feminism it actually is so i guess i just okay i just check all that apply i would be willing to give up some of my salary if i had to so that equal pay in my workspace could be a reality no i'm not a socialist i believe that men and women should be equal yes i can't help but be bothered when a song includes misogynistic lyrics even when i otherwise like the song no i don't care i know who bell hooks is no is that an angry feminist does she have a pixie cut probably i can define intersectional feminism um probably not no because the definition changes every single day intersectional feminism well maybe i can it's when like racism and classism and all of the other isms intersect with feminism to have a more nuanced version of feminism making women as oppressed as possible should i give myself that i'm not going to i don't really think i can if they change it every day i don't use the phrase hey guys when referring to a group of people that includes men and women you don't that's no i do use that i have taken a women's or gender studies class i have against my will but i have i think it is important to encourage women to pursue science and math as a career yeah but now that's not the only thing i had somebody in my family tell me that i needed to go into stem because we didn't have enough women in engineering i was like i hate stem i'm terrible at it why would you tell me to go into a career that i would be god-awful at women should be allowed to apply for a job if they fulfill 60 of the job requirements yet nobody's stopping you you can apply for anything that's one thing i've noticed when guys do not fully match up the job description they will still apply be like sure what the heck i'm great and women are so scared they're like oh i don't know i don't really fit all of it i don't really know no just apply and then wow them it's that simple i think we should change god i think we should change women's bathroom symbols to not include traditionally feminine clothing like skirts and dresses no that's stupid i believe trans people should be able to use whichever bathroom they identify with no i believe it's important to encourage women to negotiate yes please i believe that jennifer lawrence should earn as much as her male co-stars how how big is she compared to the other men in the film how much of the film is she in that's what goes into those salaries if she negotiates sure so i'm not just gonna say yes i do not think a movie should be released unless it passes the bechtel test okay the bechtel test i think is there has to be like multiple scenes in the movie where it's women talking about something other than a guy no i think you can release a film without that but these days i don't think that there are many films that are produced that wouldn't pass the bechtel test so that's not really relevant i believe all genders are entitled to the same social political rights yes that's freedom when we already have that i can explain why 78 cents to the dollar is not a fully accurate description of the gender wage gap well my explanation is there is no gender wage gap at least as the left describes it's an urban legend that never happened no way we got you my explanation would not fit what you're looking for so no i believe that women who possess certain types of privilege are responsible for advocating for women who don't have their level of privilege i think that you should support other women and uplift them regardless of their circumstances but i'm not going to do that just because i feel like i'm in a different position than them if i had a daughter i would encourage her to be anything she wanted to be yes sure except being a man i would make it clear to my daughter from an early age that her identity should never be defined by her relationship status yes that is a very good thing i believe it's important to compliment a woman's intelligence over her looks um yes i actually do believe that but i also think it sort of goes both ways because my mom was so adamant that my intelligence and you know who i am as a person be the focal point in being raised that i was never told like oh you're so pretty oh you're like whatever we never talked about princesses we never did any of that it got to the point when i was a teenager that i cared so little about looking nice and like caring and being feminine that my mom literally had to sit me down and go like hey it's okay tino want to be pretty or want to wear a dress sometimes like i probably went a little too far so you know finding a balance but yes i believe that a woman has a right to choose what happens to her body we know what they're talking about i'm just gonna skip that one in an instance of sexual assault against a female i am inclined to believe the assaulted person is telling the truth until proven otherwise obviously this is something that happens women face harassment they face rape but men do as well and even though there are many cases where a woman has accused somebody and that has been true there are also cases allah johnny depp and amber heard where there are false accusations and i think just piling on and saying that women are always in the right is a very dangerous precedent to set so i think that this question is a bit convoluted and requires nuance and just clicking a button and saying yep women are always right is not terribly true so we're moving on from that one god i hate the metoo movement i can explain marlene dietry's influence on women's fashion no i can't not at all i know what a bad feminist is i have read that book and it made me angry roxanne gay i saw her speak at a book fest and again she made me angry because she was so woke i believe that women should be able to dress however they want without dictating how they are treated by society yep that's fine i have never said that a woman asked for it oh god i don't think that i've ever said that a woman asked for it again this is a very complicated subject and every situation is different but i don't think i've ever gone around pointing fingers at a girl in you know a small dress being like oh that was she wanted it no obviously not just be careful as a female that's all i'm saying i'm offended by cat calling not really no unless it's like a creepy guy trying to get me to get into his car which has happened before i'm offended by that i'm not getting in your car i don't think that women should get vip treatment at nightclubs and bars just for being women no that sounds nice i'll take that i think police brutality and its correlation with race is a feminist issue no who wrote this damn test i think we should stop promoting models as the ideal female body type well now models are every single size so they are trying to show the models can be every size so i don't really think this is relevant anymore i think we should stop photoshopping women's bodies in the media i'm not going to tell people that we should do like a full stop if a woman wants that that's fine but i do think that it kind of provides like a weird skewed impression of what real women look like so i'll click that i've never called a woman bossy no i definitely have i probably have been called bossy before so i can't really speak on that i think company should offer more child-friendly time and programs to women who are having children it depends on the company if you want to that's great so but i'm not going to tell you to it's not my company i believe that a woman should be offered the same opportunities for promotion as her male co-workers yes absolutely and unless you are a terrible employee you are i believe that if a woman wants to pay on a date her date should let her yes when has that ever been an issue i believe that women should have easy access to birth control yes we do have that i believe that in a relationship the domestic duties should be shared sure yeah i don't like folding laundry so somebody else can do that i think that a couple should have equal responsibility over the aesthetic and cleanliness of their home well cleanliness yes aesthetic i would like to have total say over it because i think that i'm right why are you pulling me i'm right i believe that men should be encouraged to be involved in and make choices in the wedding planning process if they want to being current i mean sure sure i don't think i would be interested in planning a wedding i think i would get bored so i would rather somebody else do it i believe that men and women have the same emotional strength have you seen a woman on her period i do not have the same emotional strength as a man during that time of the month that is all i'm saying i cry at puppy dogs and rainbows that i can no longer see i've cried like that since titanic i do not think that it is the responsibility of a man to protect a woman physically well no if i was with somebody and it was a man i would like to think that they would at least attempt to protect but also i'm not going to rely on that fully which is why i will you know take the necessary steps to protect myself and to be prepared i believe that men and women should be equally encouraged to express their emotions sure i've never asked a woman why she does not have children um i don't really care i don't really i mean probably i mean i probably have but not in like an accusatory way i would be equally as excited to have a son or daughter yes i think the american workplace culture is often not structured in a way that is helpful or encouraging to women succeeding no it's equal if you are uncomfortable in the environment get comfortable with it become more aggressive negotiate better hustle more i don't know i think that women have a responsibility to help and encourage other women to pursue their goals yes boss babe girl boss i don't know i hate that whole culture but also i'm never gonna be like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] to other women that i'm working with be nice to people that you work with it's a hostile work environment i think women are equally capable to men to be the president of the united states depends on the woman have you seen kamala harris that's not capable maybe some maybe not again it's just like men there are some men that should not be the president we have one that is the president right now so i think this is an individual basis i've never criticized a woman for not wearing makeup or wearing too much makeup again it's your life do whatever you want i believe a woman is a woman if that is what she calls herself regardless of her physical attributes and makeup no here i come oh here come a woman is an adult human female i'm tired of this whole thing where womanhood is basically just a game of dress up just because you wear a dress or wear makeup does not mean that you are a woman i often don't wear dresses and i am still a female because of my biology thank you very much let's see my results this is going to be interesting you are pretty woke oh and you definitely try to stay informed about what's going on in the world of feminism how you can make it better this is not as exciting oh i checked more than 50 of quiz takers i guess i'm pretty feminist third wave guys i am i guess i am progressive i feel like this is the same sort of thing that happens with a political compass quiz or any of these quizzes that are made by liberals the questions are so black and white and they are also so biased that if you provide any reasonable answer and nuance when you're explaining why you're clicking something or you're not it doesn't really matter because depending on how many boxes you click they're still just gonna try to prove that you're woke and prove you know whatever like i didn't agree with a huge portion of this but it's hard to completely say no to some of it because again it begs nuance and i feel like i was just answering a whole bunch of blanket statements that aren't really either relevant to our current society or not completely accurate so i don't really know i don't think i'm terribly woke but i do believe that women you know can succeed in the workplace do succeed in the workplace i do believe that we should lend to helping handle women because again like i said the competitive jealousy whatever that's just terrible for everybody involved so maybe i'm more of a feminist than i expected but i don't feed into any of the modern [\u00a0__\u00a0] because it's just toxic and it does nothing productive all of these issues require so much more everything than just taking a buzzfeed quiz so i hope that all the quizzes out there are just jokes because that would be horrifying hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "nMRQCBKNhe0": "hey y'all welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper we've been doing this show for a little over a month now I think the response has been incredible like genuinely I am so happy and honored that you guys are here with me every day it is absolutely wild how fast this channel has grown and even though people have been overwhelmingly positive and very welcoming in the YouTube Community I'm obviously not exempt from trolls especially because I am not a raging leftist who will conform to their mainstream narrative so today I thought that I would Google myself and see what people are saying because I've been told that there's some good stuff on there and I think that you know now that the show has sort of been established it would be a good time to do a little dive so I thought we would start off strong with a nice Wiki article this is one of the first things that comes up uh under my name this is my picture but this is this is not me bird Giver was born on the 2nd of July in 1987 and is an American mixed martial arts fighter this has been happening for years because I've been an actor for 12 years or something like that and so when you ever you would Google me before like my IMDb would come up and then this guy Brett Cooper who is a cage fighter or something like that he has my same name but we are not the same person I can't believe I have to explain that but I literally get DMS from people saying Google says that you're 33 years old you don't look 33 I don't understand it like read the rest of the article and you will clearly see that it is incorrect because I am not a man and I am not six two and like 275 pounds uh that would be weird so let's just stop assuming that there's a few other Wiki pages that are actually about me though and they are moderately correct but like a lot of the information is very outdated like a lot of them say that I'm still pursuing my dual JD MBA which I was supposed to be continuing right now but I'm not I am making YouTube videos instead very proud of my degree right you at UCLA what are you doing and I'm like this so no I'm not doing that anymore I get DMS about that too like are you still you know pursuing those degrees no I'm not I don't know if I'll ever go back to that but no it's great we're fighting the culture War guys so obviously if I was going to look myself up I had to go to Reddit like which is the trash bin of the internet there were some gems uh the most recent big one that I saw was Brett Cooper makes me feel sick trigger warning transphobia tag trigger this was posted in r slash LGBT can't believe that they're missing the Q in there they really need to update those letters guys the q i a plus all of it unacceptable this is more of a rant but I need to get this off my chest if there's anything too extreme for here or incorrect please let me know and I'll fix it guys I'm too extreme for Reddit even if there isn't I just don't want to cross any lines if I end up doing so better safe than sorry I'm just so upset right now so I apologize in advance I'm so sorry I'm making you that upset I often like to scroll through my YouTube shorts feed for funnier interesting Clips but lately I've constantly had one or two videos from this woman Brett Cooper especially clips that showcase her reacting to lgbtq plus tick tocks especially trans people and making anti-trans comments with her comment section also supporting her for set opinions it always makes me sick especially since it often ends with making not only me feel disgusted CIS women are seen only by our reproductive organs but also makes you feel disgusted that she is invalidating trans women and all transitioning or transition folks in general for just making the transition to be who they were meant to be okay first of all why am I making you feel disgusted for pointing out the biological differences between men and women like at this stage of the game in society pointing out our reproductive differences is the clearest way that we can say that these two genders these two Sexes are not the same [Applause] if you're triggered by that I don't know what to tell you take a biology class it's fun comments often just reflect her comments but 10 times the crude warning I really wish he'd just disappear off my feet for good but YouTube seems to just miss that part no matter how much I report or ask to not see this content I Can't Be Tamed my friend maybe this is good maybe I like this is how I'm going to Red Pill this person I never get nauseated or agitated from bigotry usually I can just brush it off or simply go about my day just disappointed we still have to deal with people like this but this is the first time I've genuinely felt it and it eats me away I'm nauseating I'm nauseous I haven't seen her talked about much so I don't know if it's just me stumbling across her and if so thank God since I don't want anyone to hear or see her content and audience or if she's just not talked about since it's another matter or it's just another bigot who wants to invalidate people without wanting to learn or understand and it's best to just ignore them I really don't know what to tell you if you're getting that emotionally invested in somebody on the internet that has a different opinion than you and it's making you physically ill I would suggest just doing some self-reflection like I laugh at people on the internet all the time I don't take it home with me this is a job like there are other things in this world there weren't a ton of comments on this but the best one the top one was wait I thought she was trans well this is just peachy I'm a bigot and yet I am also trans and then the person who wrote the original post was like wait what this is confusing I just gotta know like is this just because Google says that I'm a 33 year old male cage fighter or is because I have a male name because that's the other thing I get dams from people saying why are you named after a boy dude I don't know ask my mom also I was named after a female character in a book so technically I was named after a woman there was literally a comment and somebody said parents who name their kids with like opposite gendered names should be shot excuse me again there are other things in this world that you can be concerned about I don't think Brett is a big deal there are people out there naming their kids apple or whatever like go take it up with Gwyneth Paltrow or whoever it was that was not the only Reddit post about me my other personal favorite was from the subreddit rank the alt-right I may post a picture of me it's a nice picture it's from our promo shoot daily wired hired an anti-gay anti-trans racist 20 year old Christian girl to make videos radicalizing teenagers you know me radicalizing people none of that is correct I mean yeah I'm hired by daily wire but your information is incredibly inaccurate I also like the Christian okay the top comment was I love how they make their hate so attractive and wholesome and patriotic and Jesus and candy flavored is that my brand guys wholesome and patriotic and Jesus and candy flavor maybe it is and I just never knew the guy somebody responds and says Gotta Throw God in there to make the Bubbas feel good about their hatred is that Ben Shapiro in a wig every time every time I cannot go a day without it LMAO Brett Cooper does look like Ben Shapiro she's like some lab-made conservative clone of men that was genetically altered to be a female Brett Shapiro would have been too obvious so they went with Cooper people ask me how often I get compared to Ben it's every day tweets DMS all of it it does not annoy me and don't feel bad about it I'm honestly honored and it's a running joke in the office too but I promise you it is not an original new thought that you are having just hop on the train with the rest of them continue on this has already been established that I am basically you know Ben's look alike okay and then finally I went to Twitter I usually see you know people who reply to me and that sort of thing but I wanted to see if anybody had made like individual posts this is my favorite Brad Cooper is the most annoying woman to ever live just looking at her makes my whole body cringe thanks dude love you too so the lesson here everybody information on the internet about people it's not necessarily the most reliable like one of my friends who's an actress uh Wikipedia says that her net worth is like 10 million or something like I promise you it's not she lives with her parents like if she was I'd be trying to go live on a beach somewhere with her just in general you can get kind of a basic idea of somebody based on you know a Google search but really it's not all that factually accurate and there's a lot more to me than what you see in these videos and on a Google search so keep that in mind either way this is entertaining and as the show grows I'm sure that there will be more comments like this you can't please everybody like I have people tell me that I'm too nice to the celebrities and the politicians that I talk about and I have people and big Tech attack me and give me strikes daily because I'm bullying people and making fun of people or something like that like you genuinely cannot win so if you're on the Internet or really just anywhere you're going to be judged and that's a fact so the sooner that you let it roll off your shoulders the happier you'll be whoa whoa guys I cannot believe you're about to leave this video without liking it first it's honestly kind of rude be better", "r7eIpify_bw": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper happy monday everybody i have a little uh announcement i guess before we jump into this but we hit 500 000 subscribers [Applause] which is genuinely insane thank you all so much all of you that have been here since the beginning like i think you all know but we only started this channel like three months ago last week we surpassed 100 million views now we have 500 000 subscribers it's growing so quickly and i could not be more grateful for you all being here liking and subscribing you know ringing the notification bell all that jazz it truly means the world i have a ton of fun doing the show every day so thank you for being here now the other thing that i've been having fun with is following the amber heard johnny depp trial i've done a couple of episodes about it if you follow my facebook page or any of those other social media accounts you've seen that i've done other videos about it explaining why i think it's important breaking it down that sort of thing but last week it came to a close the jury finished deliberating the verdict was announced and johnny depp was found to be a victim of defamation the jury found that amber heard lied about being abused and that she did intentionally defame johnny depp in that washington post op-ed he won by a huge margin i think he won 15 million dollars so it's been a wild week and the leftist media establishment went crazy after this now most people were in support of johnny depp i mean you could just literally look at the hashtags the hashtag justiceforjonny has like billions and billions of hits and you know uses the i stand with amber heard like a couple hundred thousand like it's pretty sad and it's pretty weak because obviously everybody saw through her [\u00a0__\u00a0] literally saw through her on the bed there's so many jokes like that is never going to die in my mind like the amber turd stuff forever we'll be using now we didn't got that out the way the leftist media the mainstream narrative is still that johnny is the abuser and that the jury ruling in his favor is now this big setback for women amber literally did a whole statement about it saying that we need to believe all women still and that the jury ignored the first amendment and her freedom of speech that she should have been allowed to write all this stuff like a whole hot mess but like look at some of these headlines this one and the winner of johnny depp versus amber heard trial is men it's not illogical for survivors to pause and say is it worth it to come forward yeah you know who was thinking about that freaking johnny depp not amber heard because she's a liar like the new yorker who i used to love said the johnny depp amber heard verdict is chilling many victims of domestic violence who watched this trial will likely conclude that if they share their experiences they will be disbelieved shamed and ostracized now you could look at that and think oh they're probably talking about johnny depp they're probably saying wow a man came forward and the entire world turned their back on him no they're also talking about amber hurt another one the depp heard trial verdict decreed as a symptom of a culture that oppresses women this is from the guardian herd's lawyer says that the verdict sends a horrible message while sexual violence experts say that it reveals a system that doesn't guarantee equal protection what you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard we could flip it on its head the people that don't receive equal protection and that usually do not receive due process are the men so yes that first article was actually right when they said the winner of the trial is men yes it is and rightfully so because for the last six years we have lived in this culture that is toxically believed that we must believe all women that women do not lie that men are always always always the oppressors that is not how the world works it is a terrible precedent to set and this trial disrupted all of it but they refused to acknowledge it because that would mean that they would have to backtrack and say that everything that they have been you know spitting out all their propaganda for the last six years has been false and has been harmful obviously they won't do that because they hate eating their words now my favorite one of these articles was from the root and it says amber heard verdict sends a message to black women everywhere what let's just get into this the amber heart verdict sends a message to black women everywhere if the mistreatment of a wealthy blonde-haired blue-eyed white actress is ridiculed by the world what does that mean for black women wow so true root you are just like hard-hitting journalism the first comment was if you're going to make this into an issue of race it's worth pointing out that the jury was mostly made up of poc including an african-american indian female did their voices not matter are we not to value their judgment that's tough that's very tough somebody said i used to think that the root was intentional satire so he said this guy still does this is literally a comment under the root article and it says it will never stop being funny that there is a black version of the onion and that it's called the root yeah because people can't figure out that this isn't satire this has nothing to do with race this has everything to do with a narcissistic mentally ill crazy woman that is lying about her ex-husband does not matter what race she is she literally has nothing to do with it another person said huh it sends a message to all women to stop lying and playing victim it takes away from real victims yes exactly that's what i've been saying this whole trial i loved this meme that's right you get in there and derail that conversation it's not about you but get in there and make it about you tomorrow president biden meets with k-pop sensation bts of the white house what this means for black women everywhere do you guys see that that was another wild thing the bts at the white house i don't think that it's as bad as when biden brought the tick tockers together to debrief them on the russia ukraine war also bringing olivia rodrigo to do like vax propaganda that was also strange the k-pop guys it was weird but i really was not paying attention probably because i'm just numb to all of this because i mean it's just all performative like it's all virtue signaling and simply trying to stay relevant in the woke conversation that's what biden does every time he brings one of these you know celebrities into the white house it's what the root is doing they feel like their you know race conversation isn't getting enough press time right now so like how can we take the mainstream narrative and make it about us again we're not oppressed enough right now literally people play this intersectionality game where it's like how many layers of oppression can i put on myself to get more attention to get the woke left to become even more progressive to make our country even more divided it's incredibly self-serving we literally live in the most narcissistic society i've ever seen stop caring so much about getting the attention of others work on yourself if this race conversation is so important to you figure it out in your own damn life just like stop trying to make everything in the news about you the world is not out to get you i promise hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "j7WKwao7KQA": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I am back in the studio after five days of barely any content so I apologize for the short notice on literally the channel going dark I got the flu on my birthday we made a big deal about my birthday was really exciting we did a whole merch sale I was super excited about it literally at three o'clock on my birthday I went home and I took a nap because I was not feeling well and I woke up and my throat was literally on fire I wasn't sure if I had strep or coveted it was the flu so I have basically been in bed since then but I'm happy to be back because there was so much that happened over this weekend I literally wanted to do like four segments today to make up for all of the content that I was missing Because the Internet went wild while I was bedridden but we're just gonna do two today because I don't want to overwhelm the editors we have to work faster but we'll make up content throughout the rest of the week but I'm very excited to be back and thank you all for the well wishes over the weekend because I did post on my Instagram if you follow me there but I was sick so anyway today we are going to talk about a tick tocker that we have discussed many times on this show because he just keeps coming back for more and he just keeps giving me good content but before we get into it you guys know the drill make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection today we are talking about the one and only Dylan Mulvaney hello Dylan he is a trans tic talker who skyrocketed to fame back in the spring when he started documenting his days of girlhood after he came out as Trans in March he literally almost has 9 million followers on the app now and it would do you know like day number one of girlhood day number 20 of doing girlhood I'm starting hormones I'm buying a new dress I'm going out on a date with a man like that kind of stuff very weird and Dylan does seem sweet and nice and I've said that before he seems like a very joyful person but whether intentionally or not he is making a mockery and a caricature out of woman and Womanhood and what we're talking about today is no different Ulta beauty the big Beauty Store kind of like the sister competitor of Sephora has a podcast they've been doing called the beauty of dot dot dot and then they have like a topic this weekend they did the beauty of girlhood and they brought Dylan Mulvaney a man who has only been a woman since March to talk about girlhood now for a little backstory Sephora got canceled a couple of years ago when they canceled and dropped one of their biggest Beauty influencers for being conservative so as a result all of the conservatives and the people with common sense ran over to Ulta because they had remained non-partisan they hadn't made any big political statements and then with this podcast episode they literally went and ruined it they bent the knee which just makes me even more grateful for companies who don't do that like good ranchers as you all know good ranchers is my very very favorite meat delivery service because they actually focus on satisfying their customers and providing good quality over politics they only source the highest quality meat and they have never had to do a meat recall because they have a 100 satisfaction guarantee their beef is either USDA prime or upper Choice their chicken is better than organic and has no added hormones or antibiotics and their Seafood is caught fresh and then flash frozen so that when it is delivered to your door you are getting the best quality possible and if you've been watching my show and thinking about trying out good ranchers this is the month to do it because they are throwing a huge oktober feast where they will give you four pounds of free meat if you go to goodranchers.com Cooper and buy a bundle of meat using my code Cooper at checkout you'll get two pounds of American wagyu ground beef and 2.5 pounds of their better than organic chicken again that is goodranchers.com Cooper use promo code Cooper at checkout to redeem your four pounds of free meat and I am telling you it is fantastic because not only do they not inject any hormones or antibiotics but they also do not inject any political wokeness sadly unlike Ulta now if you guys watch the show regularly and you saw this segment Dylan was just recently brought onto a Forbes panel about Womanhood literally two weeks ago when the internet erupted so Ulta decided this is a great idea let's do it too so they brought him on to talk about girlhood and this is the clip that has been circulating Ulta tweeted it out they said trans girls can do it all tune in to the latest episode of beauty of where host David Lopez who is also a man masquerading as a woman sits out with guest Dylan Mulvaney to chat all things girl HUD watch now yes I love two men talking about female things so exciting I'm literally so over it I know I can find love I know I can still be a performer I know that I can have a family I want to be a mom one day and I absolutely can and that's why the narrative still has a long way to go because when I was grieving boy Dylan I didn't know those things were even accessible now this is a 15 second clip but if you are just hungry for more guys there's an entire podcast episode with comments just like these is how I tuck my little privates away that sounds awful now first of all I just want to talk about the outfit because Dylan's whole thing is that he calls himself a girl because he doesn't feel like he's been a female long enough to call himself a woman and he really hones in on that girly child Essence like the big bows the brightly colored like kids dresses it's just kind of creepy and it's just a little weird and the fact that they're calling it like the beauty of girlhood it bothers me and about what you're saying you are a man you cannot be a mother it's every man's right to have babies if he wants them you can't have babies don't you oppress me motherhood is so much more than putting on a dress putting a bow in your hair putting on makeup pretending like you're Miss honey from Matilda and then acquiring a child that is not motherhood and now many will argue that giving birth and being able to get pregnant being a birth giver does not constitute motherhood because not all women can conceive and to that I say how freaking dare you to use a woman's infertility as a rationalization of your delusions is disgusting the fact that a woman can have fertility problems in the first place and mourn the fact that they cannot conceive that is part of her Womanhood and you do not get to take that it's just disgusting and it's weird and on top of all of it it's just creepy because like I said these are two adult men sitting around in dresses pretending to be women and talking about girlhood adult men pretending to be girls like I can't believe I live in a society where I'm having to argue the fact that that is weird Ulta beauty also posted this clip on Instagram and unsurprisingly they had to turn off the comments because followers were threatening to boycott the company for promoting Dylan's statements and on Twitter the comments were very similar and honestly this was a big white pill somebody said I was thinking about becoming trans but after watching this I'll keep my balls thank you very much somebody said patriarchy is undefeated and half the women in this country have rendered their Womanhood to nothing it's sad because real feminism was supposed to mean something this sure isn't yet modern day feminism is literally doing the exact opposite of what it was created to do you're just diminishing Womanhood into nothing and saying that all of these men can suddenly be women because they put on a dress you can't honest question here why did you have two grown men talking about girlhood why not women well Anita you sweet sweet old soul that's because we live in 2022 and nothing means anything anymore somebody said is that lipstick in her pocket or is she just excited to see me foreign oh God somebody said corporations will say anything for more market share yes they will do this even though they know they're alienating a huge portion of Their audience because they are too afraid to go against a radical one percent even though the majority of people in this country whether they are willing to vocalize it or not will somewhere realize that this is wrong and this is weird but they're too scared to do anything about it now people leaving these types of comments actually does give me hope because they're fed up they realize that this is delusional but even though Ulta's audience is waking up and these commenters are super based these big corporations still don't have the balls to stand up and do anything about it and push back literally the two men in this video talking about girlhood have more balls combined than most of these corporations and that's depressing but of course you know mixed into the based comments where some replies from people who are still hanging on to this delusion like this person said a lot of people are sure mad about Dylan being happy and to this man I say it's not about happiness it's not about you or anyone else's individual happiness it is about objective truth and biology because if we sit around trying to make every single damn person happy and special we will literally combust is that depressing to end on that no productive and healthy society makes that their number one priority that is not sustainable our modern day Western Civilization is living proof of this fact that if we make every single little sensitive Woodland fairy creature happy and our number one priority we will destroy our culture because that is exactly what is happening today hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "Ph0oMyU99RA": "what's up guys welcome back to the comment section happy tuesday i am brett cooper so since i first started this channel i've gotten a lot of comments from trolls i would say telling me that i am a pick me girl and literally all i had no idea what that meant i was like why do people keep saying this or they would say things like why are you trying so hard to be like a dude i was like okay so then i found out that those might be correlated i looked into it and this whole concept is just wild so i thought today we would do a deep dive i volunteer as tribute this skit has half a million views and it attempts to explain being a pikmi girl so i thought i would react to it as your resident pick me girl so we can watch together anyway if you guys don't want to talk about justin or me or my dope music career then what do you want to talk about you're a pikmi girl anna you hate other women and only feel validated by the attention of men it's not your fault you're a toxic byproduct of a patriarchal society that protects men at any cost how dare you both accuse me of internalized misogyny just because i'm more attractive and full than you are there it is you're literally saying your worth is in your desirability to the opposite sex okay michelle look you wear flannel we get it you hate men it doesn't mean that i have to hate men too it has nothing to do with men and everything to do with the problematic way you view why because i believe in female privilege okay that's not a thing so being a pygmy girl is apparently hating women thinking that you're better than them and they're more attractive than all the other ones this is why i like hanging out with guys women are so complicated and so much drama see how well you are to throw women under the bus that was one time melissa one time and guess what kitty's leg healed just fine oh yeah sure she has a little bit of a limp but if you ask me it looks great on her what are you gonna let me live that down it was like a month ago look we love you anna it's just that every time a guy comes into your life you put our friendship on the back burner you literally bailed on your best friend's birthday to hang out with a guy that you've only known for a few weeks you constantly make excuses for men's bad behavior you make sexist jokes against women and you victim blame no matter the situation wow [Music] okay i didn't know i'm sorry truly okay we didn't want to do this but i think we have to what the hell is that come on we have to show you where you came from [Music] pick me pick me pick me i don't know all my best friends are guys i don't understand girls i'd rather lose my right to vote than lose my right to bear arms oh my god what is this place welcome to the byproducts of the patriarchy whatever's going on here stop it immediately although that was funny the girl that was like i'd rather lose my right to vote than my right to bear arms if i had to choose she's not wrong so all the comments under this people were taking it so seriously to be honest it is very hard to get out of the pick me girl phase at least it was is for me i'm constantly improving but dude i'm in it too deep in some ways it's embarrassing but at least i'm doing my best to someday overcome it what is this it's like it's like blm again like i'm learning and listening someone says i'm trying very hard to make more female friends but making friends is hard yeah it is y'all i just moved across the country to a random city i can tell you making friends is hard i find the backlash to these i'm different girls to be a bit harsh as an adult watching mostly kids throw these terms around some girls are genuinely tomboys some have not had positive experiences with females don't love all of these girls and with the ones who deliberately try to distance themselves from women due to internal imbalances let's not fight one extreme with another every case is individual yeah this comment's good like i don't i don't care if you're a guy or a girl if you're crazy or you have an internal imbalance i actually really like that i'm gonna start using it i will just distance myself from you i don't i don't have the energy or the interest to deal with that it's not about gender it's just my general distrust and ambivalence towards people so now there's there's also a whole tick tock genre explaining pikmi girls making fun of pikmi girls they have like pikmi girls in different situations i did a deep dive triggered because apparently this is me but here's another girl explaining it all right this is how to spot a pikmi girl listen we did one on pikmi boys look we love equality here so we got to do pygmy girls as well hi my name is chloe and i am in fact your new best friend and i like to think i know a thing or two because i've seen a thing or two okay i feel like pikmi girls are a lot more like emotional like they almost make it know that they're like a pick me girl i mean they say the same stuff like oh i'm not like the other girl i'm just quirky when in reality they'll just kind of hang out with a bunch of dude which is fine right but then their opinion will just kind of change based on the guy they're talking to or the guy they like like regardless of what they actually think next up i feel like snapchat can be pick me girl central like i feel like they're all queens of putting black screens on their story saying stuff like ugh don't hit me up i'm sad like honestly i've come to the conclusion they're saying don't hit me up because they want people to hit them up like they kind of want people to be worried about them so they'll play like juice world in the background and then say guys don't hit me up but in reality they want that attention everything i learn about this people hate pick me girls some girl commented on this and she was like i'm kind of starting to be worried that i'm a pick me girl but not on purpose because i complain about my height all the time parentheses i'm really short who cares if you want to talk about your height that's fine can i not say anything without becoming a pikmi girl like things are going downhill rapidly for me here i thought that this might just be an internet trend but there are literally deep dives into pygmy girls and their problematic nature online like an article form i thought that this was satire but it's not i'm going to read you a couple of lines from this this is from modern intimacy it's called the psychology of the pikmi girl right at the beginning these women are easy to pick on because her attitude towards other women's interests mannerisms lifestyle choices and hobbies feels inauthentic and is ultimately rooted in misogyny she has no problem putting other women down to gain male attention validation whether or not she knows that that is typically the intent the pick me mentality denotes a woman who lives within a restrictive male-centric standards that likely is painful to some degree that's not to say that society should accept problematic behaviors but that we might try to find some empathy to understand the pygmy girls potentially have not considered how their actions and beliefs contribute to sexism internalized misogyny and ultimately the continued oppression of women i'm oppressing people because i have male hobbies help help i'm being repressed that was another thing in this article they were like oh yeah if she likes like male sports and that kind of thing that's the patriarchy i thought that like gender attributes were social constructs i thought we were over that someone who is a pygmy girl has likely not unpacked why she feels compelled to proudly demonstrate loyalty to men while distancing herself from fellow women identifying people if you think that i'm a pikmi girl because i have played male dominated sports and i i don't know maybe seem chill and hang out with guys like that's fine i really don't care you can blame my three older brothers if you think i have a loyalty to men it's because the best people in my life are my brothers and that that's just where i've learned all of this from so i feel like i can't even refute any of this without somebody now coming back and being like you're a pick me girl because you're saying that you're not you're talking badly about women no listen me being a gun-toting snowboarder who wears flannels sometimes does not make me any less of a woman than someone who loves makeup and beautiful dresses and brunching like y'all can teach me about that and i will teach you how to whip a man's ass at a gun range it's a good trade it's totally fine i don't get what the big deal is all of this is just wild like we need to calm down and find other things to talk about do you want to be the only person that is not caught up on the internet's latest chaos i don't think so so make sure you subscribe and ring that bell so you don't miss out on any comment section content", "wh1eeAovklg": "how are you ready yep stand by [Music] insane [Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock I am clearly not in the studio right now which is one of my favorite things in the entire world to go out into the nashville-ish area meet cool people and today I am with the founder and the owner of T-Rex arms Lucas botkin thanks for having me thanks for coming out we are going to tour the facility shoot some guns I'm super excited because literally since day one you guys have been commenting relentlessly saying when are you gonna go to the range when you're actually going to film yourself shooting you get that today so let's go do it it'll be great so three years ago we purchased this facility here and we moved out of a very small little shed basically where I started the company and so we have a much larger facility here that's 10 000 square feet for this building and this is the building where we primarily make the holsters and manufacture the holsters which is the bread and butter of the business it's how the business started but the main thing that sets T-Rex apart from some of the other companies in our industry is we're more of an educational and ideas company we're really pushing a lot of the standards when it comes to training and just the concept behind self-defense personal responsibility and really trying to push culture a lot of companies put a lot of money and effort into politics which is great but we all know that politics is Downstream from culture so if you don't have firearms companies that are pushing the culture side of it then in 10 years when people want to ban AR-15s or body armor the culture wasn't there in developing the Firearms owners to be able to actually fight those you know regulations that come down the pike so that's our main mission here at T rex arms to inspire educate and equip our customers and educate them on what the gears for and why we have it so that's what sets T-Rex apart all right so as always we're going to follow the four Farm safety rules out here at the range so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to assume that every weapon is loaded we are going to keep our finger off the trigger until we are ready to fire we're going to be aware of our targets foreground and background in this case it's pretty simple burn paper Target and we're not going to aim the weapon or anything we're not willing to destroy [Music] foreign [Applause] so this is where the holsters begin we produce holsters custom so what that means is when you go on our website and you order a right-handed holster for a Glock 19 you get to pick whatever color that we have camouflage patterns you know solid so you go and you pick exactly what color you want what gun right hand left hand and because of all the different types of firearms on the market and the colors you know we make the holsters for everything has to be made custom so what I have here is an order that we're gonna have made same day for a custom holster for you okay uh for a Glock yep 43 to nine millimeter uh you are right-handed yep which is great um left-handed people you know anyways [Music] foreign so the material we're using is called tidex it's a thermal molding plastic that looks like this when you buy it raw from the manufacturer but once you heat it up to about 300 degrees it starts to turn into a Velveeta cheese and then you can form it to anything so what we have over here are industrial t-shirt presses that heat the material up to that 350 degrees and then once the material is hot we put it onto our custom mold and it's going to suction down onto the mold and that gives us the shape of the firearm foreign [Music] so now the machine is ready to cut the holster out so it's going to be you know on the entire piece of Kydex that's been formed once the holster is actually cut out it has this very sharp edge from the machine so we have to buff the edges with these little motorized buffing wheels to make it nice and comfortable to wear so after we've cut out the holster and we buff the edges the last thing we have to do is actually fold the entire holster in half so what that means is we have to heat up the center and then we have the holster that is perfectly centered up so the gun will actually fit and it actually will resemble a holster and not a pancake foreign [Music] it's so cool though okay so one of the reasons why I was so excited to talk with Lucas specifically and come to T-Rex arms is because they focus so much on education and on their values and you guys know if you watch my videos I do carry I'm a huge two-way Advocate especially for women when I talk about guns I always try to bring it back to that issue because it impacts me personally so I care about it but I do believe that guns are the great equalizer for women especially in this world right now and so I have Lucas here we're going to talk specifically to women if you have women in your lives if you are a girl this is for you so yeah let's talk about choosing a gun for you holsters so first off there's a big misconception that there is one good way to carry as a woman women's bodies are it's a little harder to find holsters that conform to the body it's also dependent a lot on fashion and what women want to do and it is actually kind of ironic in some ways that a lot of women want to look nice and pleasing for men which is great we appreciate that but in the process of doing that we'll generally wear clothing that doesn't allow them to carry a weapon to actually protect themselves and sort of the irony there is women actually need to be carrying a firearm often more than men do women are targeted more and then of course there's a lot of misconceptions on you know what handgun women should you know women should carry a lot of people go oh you need to have a pink revolver or you got to have a revolver in general because it's simple and they don't fail and there's only five or six bullets you know a lot of people want to carry a smaller handgun like this m p Shield because it's easy to conceal on body or a little pocket pistol 32 380 or revolver and the downside to those is they're typically a whole lot harder to shoot for women the recoil springs and the slides are much harder to articulate women not always but that will often have less wrist strength compared to men so for us we like to recommend a sub compact or a compact Duty style handgun that has good round capacity which is very important that shoots a nine millimeter round or above the p365 line the new Glock 43 43x those are great and then if you can go up to a double stack more traditional like the Glock 19 or in this case the m p compact 2.0 my wife carries a Glock 19 specifically because it's easier for her to shoot she likes that so she runs with a Glock 19. that's something that I think women need to consider and it does mean considering your wardrobe and modifying it so it really comes down to goals trying out holsters I don't have a lot of good recommendations for what women should use as a man it's also hard for me to recommend exactly what women should use that's something they're going to have to figure out not going to pretend like I can so if I do not mansplaining exactly but these starting from with like handguns in general look for a capable handgun first then look at your holsters options and then think about your wardrobe so the last part of the tour is the Armory we have a lot of products here that we are constantly doing videos on and trying to educate our customers on and so we have a lot of rifles we have different Optics we try to have one of everything in the industry and we have quite a few items let's put it that way and this is where you film most of your videos because I recognize this from the background so if you guys know Lucas this is probably it's my office one of them very cool it's so sick this is like packed to the brim it's awesome oh there's more coming we're not even halfway there [Applause] [Music] [Applause] poster made so we should open it up and see how it works because I'm very excited okay because so many of you literally leave comments in DM me asking me to play video games so I stream sometimes I play video games but I've never played Call of Duty and you guys are always saying please play Call of Duty I'm basically doing that right now because Lucas did motion capture for the 2019. Call of Duty so um I was approached by Infinity Ward in I want to say it was mid or early 2017. they had been watching some of my videos they had seen the running and gunning shooting that I do and they said hey would you be interested in coming out and doing mocap for the game now this was very uh just very cool for me because the original Call of Duty games Modern Warfare 1 and Modern Warfare 2 inspired me in a large way to do what I do and so going there and being in the studio and talking to the guys and Consulting on some of the weapon stuff and doing the mocap was uh I guess you could say a dream come true all right so the Sun is setting down so I have to leave but thank you so much for having me out here and thanks to all of the T-Rex guys that are behind the camera right now that have reloaded every one of these guns and brought them all out there plastic so thank you guys this was so much fun go follow Lucas go follow T-Rex arms especially if you're a woman I'm telling you get comfortable with guns educate yourself it is incredibly empowering and it is essential in the times we're living in so go check these guys out and thank you for having me thank you [Music] well

unbeknownst to me Pride goes on throughout the entire year I think I basically said the same thing a couple of days ago when I said I thought the protest season was basically just in the summer and then I had to correct myself because people protested literally every single day I thought that Pride was just you know constrained to June pride month no no what I have learned over the past six or seven months is that Pride happens whenever a city or county or whatever wants to have their own pride festival so in a place called Venice Florida in Sarasota County just this past weekend they had their pride festival and some kind of grotesque things went down but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection but I would suggest you wait until next week maybe you know holiday deals and things like that anyway all right let's go ahead and get into this story so like I said this happened in Venice Florida it was their county-wide pride festival here is their advertisement for it pride a community Festival Saturday November 12th Centennial Park cute little child's hands painting things rainbow Yurts for some reason I think they need a new graphic designer a dog with glasses there was also a pet part of this pride festival I don't know why we had to bring the dogs into this they did not ask for that they literally cannot even say no this was an event that was promoted by the city it was on the city's event calendar it was at a public park there you go Venice pride festival and you can see I've highlighted here it says they're going to have a diverse mix of entertainers and activities for all ages and the primary objective is to build collaboration around community and they're going to have different dancer singers drag queens and a kid's corner so nice now I obviously highlighted where they said all ages and then I read you where they said Kids Corner and here's the Kids Corner part of their website again there's the child's hands painting activities enjoyed by all ages enjoy the Kids Corner for some fun activities adults are welcome too there's also a children's interactive Fountain near the Gazebo the free water retraction is open from 9 30 a.m to 9 30 p.m daily you would expect in a rational world with you know Common Sense and decency that they would actually try to keep this event family friendly because they're advertising that it's for all ages you would expect that they would keep sexual behavior out of in all ages public event of course not because it's 2022. so right in the middle of the festival they had a dildo ring toss game a dildo ring toss game I'm sorry like what the only meat that should be in public is good ranchers meat that is just truly outrageous but to take your mind off of it just for a brief moment I'm so excited to tell you about good ranchers incredible Black Friday offer right now when you use my code Cooper you will get two 12-ounce Black Angus New York strip steaks and two pasteurized chicken breasts and if you've been listening to my show for a while and you've heard me talk about good Ranchers but you have not taken the plunge yet this is the time to do it I think that this is the best offer I have ever talked about and this is also a great time because we are obviously all concerned about the economy but not only is inflation skyrocketing making food prices higher the cattle herd is shrinking which is also causing beef prices to Skyrocket and good ranchers is mitigating that for you because once you buy a subscription with them your price is locked in it is inflation proof this is a great way to feed your family while supporting a company that shares our values if you want to check them out go to goodranchers.com and use that promo code Cooper for this Black Friday offer again that is goodranchers.com promo code Cooper at checkout alright I'm sorry to tell you but your break is over we're back to talking about dildos now so prepare yourself so this dildo ring toss game was hosted by an organization called can Community Health can stands for Community AIDS Network and they promote HIV awareness to try to get people help for any kind of age HIV STDs that sort of thing here are some pictures of said dildo toss there are seven of them here now notice in this picture pulled my lips of tick tock there is a girl who looks to be about 12 years old standing right next to seven dildos so not only were public children able to just walk around and see these but can had a child working the dildo toss table standing right behind them staring at those dildos like did the thought not cross anybody's mind that maybe this would be inappropriate hey maybe let's not have a 12 year old volunteer Manning this table now Libs of tick tock also found some photos from Cannes other appearances at Pride events around the country where they also had dildos it seems like dildos are the very common thing apparently they bring them to talk about like condom use and to talk about sexual health listen I was in health class I think that there are more anatomical ways to talk about that rather than just waving dildos around literal children Adam Coleman replied to this and said perverts know how to make perversion fun yeah that's disgusting somebody else said people who say why do we care what happens in their bedroom why do they keep bringing stuff that should be in their bedroom out in public which is so real because I have always been somebody that says like I don't care what you do at home I don't want your money I'm not trying to take your money I don't care your personal life is your personal life but when you bring your personal life and your weird crap out in public around children then it becomes a problem for all of us because then you're bringing it out from behind the closed doors of your bedroom in the face of 12 year old little girls then it becomes a public problem thank you very much somebody replied and said because that's the only way they identify themselves anymore oh mic drop yeah uh somebody else said well I hope the next civilization does better than we did yeah this seems like the end of times now after Libs of tick tock first published this story on her sub stack and the Twitter account local press learned about it and learned about our outrage and this is how they decided to frame their response this is from Florida Politics the headline is Sarasota Republicans freak out at what's for sale at Venice pride and then here is the first line of this article so toys were being sold by drag queens at the event like what I didn't hear about that I was only informed about the dildo ring toss but I guess in addition to this game there were also sex toys being sold by drag queens great yes we are freaked out about that stop ridiculing us Republican officials in Sarasota are expressing outrage that sex toys were publicly sold at Venice Pride Jack Brill acting chair of the Republican party of Sarasota County said if the Pride Celebration claims to be a family-friendly event there shouldn't be booths with thong wearing drag queens Hawking such merchandise yeah no that's common sense that shouldn't be up for debate I don't know why you're insinuating that this is some atrocious thing that we're saying then the article went on and they started talking about the dildo toss and according to some board members of Venice Pride the dildo toss was just an accident and the quote is we understand if it is an event with kids and families there they do not bring the ring toss but they didn't realize we would have kids and families or they didn't read our materials oopsie she said that the organization also apologized for the ring toss being present at the event yeah well then take your hand [Music] get the dildos away from the children they were there obviously long enough for people to take pictures and realize it and become outraged if you realize that there were children at the event you should have immediately gone oh let me put this away I'm so sorry not like oh I didn't I didn't see the entire advertisement about Kids Corner oh I'm sorry no that's just a blatant lie you are gaslighting people stop it now what is even more appalling is that one of the lead coordinators of the entire event spent her whole career in elementary school education like did she not catch this so she was walking around the event if she saw that she should have said hey you know all ages let's just put that away no Marcy Jack that's her name she did not and here's her bio it says Marcy is a retired Elementary physical education teacher with years of experience planning and organizing school and community events great years of planning school events I don't think I would have wanted to be at any of those school events Marcy if you think it's appropriate for children to be around dildos now on top of that cam the organization who brought the dildos their Treasurer on their executive board is Sarasota County's principal of the year he works with children every single day now you would think that he would know what is appropriate and what he is endorsing at this organization apparently not because either of these people are all freaks with no understanding of respectability or the importance of protecting children or they simply just don't care or possibly even worse they are too scared to push back or say anything it actually reminds me of something that happened at Boise Idaho's Pride event that happened back in September again apparently pride is all year round but Boise's happens in the fall I was there for last year's it was interesting I was still working at a restaurant in downtown Boise at the time and I remember their Festival happening they shot off fireworks it was a hot mess anyway I digress Boise Pride happened in September and Zion's Bank was a huge sponsor they had sponsored Pride for many years but they found out that this year kids were going to be included in the program there was going to be some like drag kids show whatever and they drew the line and they said no we're pulling out we do not endorse this here's their statement they said over the years Zions Bank has supported a variety of Pride events because they are important part of our support for our lgbtq employee and allies and our representatives of our efforts to Foster an inclusive diverse and Equitable workplace and Community this support for all of our employees and communities remains unchanged however when we committed to our sponsorship of this year's Boise Pride event we were unaware of the events activities involving children and minors since learning of these specific activities we have made the decision to withdraw our participation in this year's Boise Pride event and have communicated this to the event organizers mic drop that is that's incredible you can still support people that are lgbtq while drawing a Line in the Sand and saying children do not need to be around sexually lewd activities we do not need to be including children in this but the point is that is what actual bravery looks like as a company like this is what it looks like to draw a line in the sand regardless of what your customers and your community might think whatever backlash you might get I just love them and I wish I still lived in Idaho so I could bank with them because we need more of this okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "-Xi-THd1AUQ": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I was going to start this episode out by saying it's Marathon season like everybody's running these marathons but then I realized there's really a season for marathons it's kind of spread out I would not know because I am not an insane person that puts myself through the hell of running a marathon I did a half marathon once it was a Disney half marathon with my mom I wore a tutu I did not train whatsoever one of the most exhausting experiences of my life so I will not be partaking in the things I'm telling you about but if you're into that sort of thing we've got a crazy story for you but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection it is almost time for the Chicago marathon it's not Marathon season but that is happening on October 9th so two days from now and there are some Runners who are feeling a bit dissatisfied about the entire situation now obviously we have talked a lot about trans athletes in the last year especially in the wake of Leah Thomas the male to female swimmer who absolutely dominated the NCAA swimming tournaments and we've talked a lot about maybe needing a special category for transgender athletes because if they want to compete if you were an adult that has transitioned sure whatever but you should not be completing against people who are biologically a different gender it's that simple so many marathons have started making that addition and they have been doing non-binary divisions to include these people and trans people and according to Fox the Boston Marathon made its announcement of a non-binary division last month the division will be open in 2023 the London Marathon also created a non-binary division for next year New York City marathons last year the Philadelphia distance run was the first large race in the U.S to establish this special Division and they did it last year and you could win prize money all the normal stuff so it's basically just another gender division like you would have male female whatever and the Chicago marathon which is happening in two days just announced theirs but people are not happy because apparently it is not enough here's the headline from Fox it says Chicago marathons quiet non-binary division Edition feels hurtful Runner says and fox then covered an article originally published by the Chicago Sun Times that detailed a non-binary runner named Cal who still feels excluded even though they have a non-binary division to run in here's Cal running a marathon in San Francisco I believe Cal is biologically a man what goes by vavam I can't tell for sure but I'm guessing just looking at the armpit hair and the wingspan I think that is biological man and Cal said the name is Cal Amia I definitely when I originally read it thought that it was chlamydia and I was like that's unfortunate for you and in this article cow said that they grew concerned when they realized that there was no Elite non-binary division as in male and female races or any Finish Line Ribbon or monetary prize they then noticed that there had been no Public Announcement to promote the division and said personally it feels hurtful because it feels performative or brushed under the rug because it really is a big deal said calm media personally it feels hurtful because it feels performative or brushed under the rug because it really is a big deal said calamia a teacher in San Francisco who grew up in Gray's Lake Hold Up Wait A Minute a teacher why are they always teachers why that was the thing about the story that really stood out to me the most I was going through and I was like okay of course obviously all these jokes on Libs of tick tock's tweets like we're at some crazy person with like piercings hanging out of their you know every hole on their face and they're you know talking about identifying as a frog turns out they're always teachers and in this case it's also accurate what a plot twist calamia continued and said as a trans athlete showing up and registering for these races is a hard thing to do because there's not usually space what makes it easier is when big organizations with a lot of power say we're adding this category and we're proud of it and we're doing what it takes to celebrate these Runners who are now being invited to our event like are you kidding me they added the division what did he want and entire parade in your honor saying oh look yay you guys can run we're gonna celebrate we're gonna have rainbow flags flying everywhere no you are being treated like a normal decent human being they are giving you the respect of adding a division for you and apparently that's still not enough another Runner who was quoted in the article said that non-binary Runners deal with more than normal people because they worry about getting misgendered while they're running and finding a correct bathroom to use but like y'all you're running 26 miles everybody is going to be sweating and dying while running for four hours like they are not going to be thinking about your gender and nobody is getting the Star Treatment with Marathon bathrooms everybody is going to use a freaking porta potty and newsflash they are already gender neutral I don't know why I am having to tell you that you don't need a special non-binary bathroom you already have one nobody is getting non-binary bathrooms with heated toilet seats in a freaking bidet while running the Chicago marathon so calm down somebody commented and said just run your Marathon people I ran the Chicago marathon in 2012. it was fantastic I wish more people would just enjoy the journey and experience I was happy just to finish yes and be grateful for what they are doing for you another person said shocking the vevam community realized they then can't just be happy nope there had to be something to about yes exactly they don't actually care about their so-called progress they just want to complain all the time somebody said you could give out free ice cream and pony rise in the non-binary crowd would still have grievances yeah they would probably be upset that the horses were gendered or something I don't know don't give many ideas this person said excited to hear that I no longer have to sit out of the Chicago marathon due to being non-binary I now get to sit it out due to having dog cardiovascular endurance instead uh I'm same it's actually very relatable another person said because the Chicago marathon didn't make a big deal out of having a trans division for its race these people got pissed off nothing makes them happy they are Perpetual victims yes could not have said it better myself it will never be enough you have your own division people on both sides of the political aisle could support this and see it as some sort of compromise and a way to protect everyone and protect the athletic Integrity but you still find a way to turn yourself into a victim and continue seeking attention this is not about empowerment or inclusion this is about Perpetual whining and wanting to act like an overgrown toddler grow up be grateful and run the damn race run I certainly won't but if that's something you want to do just shut up and run do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that Bell so you never miss an episode", "va6zsg6f8xw": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper so obviously if you follow the news in this kind of sphere in any capacity and if you've been watching the show you know that over the summer we talked a lot about Leah Thomas and NCAA swimming now if you don't know Leah Thomas was a mediocre male swimmer at Princeton and then halfway through his college career transitioned and immediately began dominating the women's division of swimming I mean for lack of a better word literally blowing girls out of the water breaking records and obviously controversy erupted and now here we are at the end of 2022 we have apparently not learned any lessons because there is yet another sport where men are simply better at breaking women's records and this time it is at a high school in Seattle which surprises no one but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection and you might want to do that at the end of this week because some cool deals could be coming out now last year as a High School freshman a boy named Aspen was competing on the boys team and finished 72nd in the league finals now this year he has socially transitioned to become a girl and is now competing on their team and guess what just you know silly little coincidence he is now ranked number one in the league and also broke the school record for the 5 000 meter race the women's 5 000 meter race here he is winning there he is sitting on top of the podium uh you just look at the girls next to him this one she is a mood look at her scowling I love her somebody replied and said it takes balls to succeed in women's sports yes it does both metaphorically and physically I mean it is just absolutely delusional and I I hate everybody that just feeds and plays into it is a strong independent woman it's utterly ridiculous like thank God Nami skincare does not do that maybe skin care believes that your first vote is always cast back at The Ballot Box but now it is up to you to vote every day with your wallet and Mimi gives you an incredible option to support brands that also support your values they stand against cancel culture and wokeness and they actively give back to American organizations like Women of Faith and Girls on the Run notice how that is Girls on the Run not fake women little boys on the run now on top of all of that nimi skincare's products actually work I've been using them for almost a year now they have totally transformed my skin I do a combination of their hydrate and protect bundle and their daily glow up routine it is perfect for me and if you want to try them out go to nimiskincare.com use code Cooper at checkout for 15 off your order again that is nimiskincare.com code Cooper at checkout and you can rest easy knowing that you're skin is clear and you are not supporting a company that feeds into all of this nonsense now it is always important to ask questions and be critical especially because Aspen is Young you might think like Brett what if just over the last year he really hit puberty he got stronger he had a growth spurt he started hitting the gym so he wasn't just a scrawny little freshman maybe he would have been highly ranked on the men's team too no because his record-breaking time in that 5000 meter race would have landed him in the 48th spot in the men's league obviously he improved but y'all 48th that's not a that's not a massive jump now a Seattle coach in the area commented on this and commented on the biological advantage that he has and said girls in Cross Country frequently Peak their freshman or sophomore year they grow unhelpful for running longer and faster body parts as they mature it is very rare and not at all curvy girls that keeps getting better all the way through high school this is why high school teams tend to be younger girl dominated the opposite is true of boys they keep getting bigger and stronger not growing any unhelpful breasts and hips body parts this kind of goes back to what I was saying obviously he's getting stronger but he's getting stronger as the girls are biologically regressing as they also get older somebody commented and said between swimming competitions and beauty pageants young girls everywhere are being conditioned to accept and resign to the fact that they will always come in second no matter how hard they work to boys who make a mockery of what it means to be a girl enough of this garbage and then there is a picture of Leah Thomas there he is so feminine of him and that pageant Queen the male one the pageant King that we talked about last week somebody replied and said patriarchy wins again and somebody else oh this is Nick Freitas he said you really have to admire how the patriarchy convinced the woke to advocate for it now somebody on the other side of the issue commented and said you guys really need to read about HRT and how it gives transgender athletes a disadvantage rather than an advantage okay then why are they winning it isn't the drugs or the puberty blockers that are giving them the advantage it is biology it is men who are quite literally built different competing against women who are also built different I'm built different why don't we see a bunch of trans men beating CIS men now lives of tick tock did awesome work breaking this story and went and spoke to people who are involved in Seattle including another coach in the league she wrote Seattle Academy which is where Aspen goes competes in the emerald sound conference which is comprised of 14 Schools lives of tick tock spoke with a coach in the conference who told us allowing Hoffman that's Aspen to compete against biological girls deprives other girls teams of the chance to compete at state which is a big deal if Hoffman competed in the boys division Hoffman would place a 56th on the boys team she also spoke to a couple of parents one of whom said quote Hoffman is larger than any of the girls and shamelessly takes first place on the podium now my daughter is competing against a male for scholarships and we can't even say anything you can't even approach it in a nice way without being labeled a hateful bigot you will get threats against you that is a father and this is the next line that really stood out to me parents are terrified to even raise concerns about Hoffman's presence on the girls team another parent noted parents are upset but they know it has to go to the state committee which is in politics it's the State High School Board and unless there is any kind of pressure on them to change the rule nothing is going to happen so then put the pressure on that board if parents are too afraid then where is it going to come from you can't just sit back and expect other people to take up the fight for your children this is a great comment somebody said honestly I'm sick of hearing that parents are terrified to even raise concerns get your values in order if you are terrified now how do you think it's going to be in 12 months certainly not better because of your silence speak up and stop the terror you owe it to your kids absolutely like we we will speak out on behalf of these children the girls and Aspen both but in the end it comes down to the parents it is your job to advocate for them and protect them whether that be in the Integrity of women's sports or for your child that is allegedly questioning their gender and needs help rather than harmful medical affirmation if it's not you then who is going to do that thank you

out who Elon impregnates first to Twitter because this man is single-handedly solving the world's population crisis everywhere he works every company he starts he has a baby mama at one of them it's wild now obviously a lot of Twitter employees were very very upset like those two that I showed in the picture and this girl who went viral yesterday for tweeting this hey Elon Musk thanks for visiting Twitter San Francisco hope you enjoyed your coffee at the perch just one question was it fun to look at the faces of the people you said you'd be laying off did you think that was a good idea this guy just bought your company and you're tweeting that publicly just watch she's going to get fired for either this or something else iombas discriminated against he doesn't like me what that is the most unprofessional thing I have ever seen you hate this man so much that you're willing to publicly say that publicly condemn him and you still work there no it's just these people are ridiculous now unsurprisingly she privated all of her tweets after that started to get traction so sadly I could not look at the comments under that because I really wanted to so that was a bummer because she has no balls and she probably did it but anyway she is right Elon started laying off people immediately he had said last week that he was wanting to fire a lot of people just clear house get new people in he did start doing that immediately but specifically the c-suite this is from disclose.tv they said just in Elon Musk took control and immediately fired Twitter CEO the CFO and the head of legal policy trust and safety according to Washington Post and guys that head of legal policy trust and safety Vijaya is the person who made the call to permanently ban Donald Trump and in case you've forgotten that little story about her and any videos you've seen of her here's a throwback from Project veritas this is from a leaked Twitter call back in 2021 obviously so a small team gathered from trust and safety we were discussing um the potential for violence to happen and we decided to escalate our enforcement of the Civic Integrity policy in years a label that disabled engaged to stop the spread of potentially inflammatory content which is the content around election interfering selection frauds during the election that type of thing so you will have noticed that morning but only when it's on the right actually you won't censor her sometimes [Music] and some instances to um and that last bit was the key Point permanent suspension so she was the one in her little small team of Civic trust and safety people made the call to ban Donald Trump and lives of tick tock posted this uh how it started how it's going Vijaya Gad Indian American who spearheaded suspension of Trump's Twitter account look at her girl bossing well lady you girl bossed way too close to the sun because how it's going is that you just got fired tough luck apparently according to Politico she was crying as she left on her last day they said Twitter's top lawyer reassures staff cries during meeting about musk takeover Gad cried during the meeting as she expressed concerns about how the company could change according to three people familiar with meaning she acknowledged that there are significant uncertainties about what the company will look like under musk's leadership wow the company may be becoming more freedom oriented not being authoritarian calm down you people are so sensitive I'm so sorry that this is happening to you but you know isn't it the consequence of your own actions like had you and your team not been authoritarian thought police [\u00a0__\u00a0] he probably wouldn't have bought the damn company anyway so you made your bed now lie in it you're getting fired don't let the door hit you on the way out glad she's gone other people were also crying and melting down Twitter famous trans activist Aaron Reed you guys probably know said um remember that time when a billionaire was so pissed off at trans people that he bought a social media Network LOL everyone knows Elon Musk is doing this because we trans his daughter took his wife and banned his favorite transphobic accounts like I'm sorry self-centered much subtle much this tweet started you know circulating on right wing Twitter and Aaron got all up in a tizzy and was like they don't get the joke they think I'm being serious we're not transient like no it's not that we did not get the joke we are amplifying that because that's literally what you guys do you might be joking about it but but you do actually trans the kids that's why we're talking about it because you are not even hiding anything that you're doing but Aaron's was not the worst tweet that I saw which is surprising this guy said I reiterate Elon Musk wouldn't have the money to buy a social network so we could write it up if he ever had to pay his goddamn taxes but that is an actual lie that we have debunked countless times last year Elon Musk paid more money in taxes than any person in American history he is not evading taxes he is paying them he is funding a lot of the corruption right now unknowingly because they took all of his money so calm down that is a lie that is an absolute fart stop it this one got listed by siraj stay hold your ground like a Ukrainian this is not a war he just bought Twitter none of you guys are going anywhere Taylor Lorenz uh said it's like the Gates of Hell opened on this site tonight yeah cause we're all celebrating the fact that it is no longer owned by authoritarians sorry that's so offensive to you I also really enjoy this ratio now Taylor has it so that you cannot reply to her posts if she does not follow you so the only way that you can interact with her is through quote tweets and all of those are people making fun of her because she is everybody's favorite doxing authoritarian aging coveted fear-mongering journalist she's great other people on the app had a great time last night which is what I am choosing to end this segment on because it's just very fun Tim pool and Jack was sobia cracked open a 4 500 of cognac on the show last night which was very fun the deal was made final while he was streaming which is very cool so my other favorite response is this one is from Kyle kashu who's a friend of mine all across the country immigrant parents are texting their kids Elon music just bought Twitter what did you get done this week Greg price said if you have a [\u00a0__\u00a0] and balls you are a man the vaccine doesn't work the election was stolen climate change is the hoax code probably came from a lab children's hospitals are doing sex changes on kids and Ellen Page is a boring lesbian and then he replied and said for context I once got banned for a day for saying that Ellen Page was a boring lesbian so there are a lot of people that are tweeting the things that they got banned for to see if everybody is too busy dealing with Elon and elon's already making enough changes that they're not going to get banned it's kind of fun it was kind of a lawless landscape last night which I really enjoyed that's how it should be it's chaos introduce a little Anarchy Chef Andrew gruel said so far people have stuck to their word have done the following left Twitter moved to Canada fought in Ukraine and banned sex anything else yeah like you guys remember these from earlier in the summer when all of this started Elon Musk this is directly to you enjoy Twitter I just deactivated mine I will not be reactivating it today Twitter has announced that they've been bought by Elon Musk or however you say his name um I'm not interested in staying on Twitter anymore because of this and I think there's a lot of people that are about to leave I did a thing today I deactivated my Twitter account you can too they just hate him and they like whining about something and crying about something which is pretty normal and last but certainly not least a message from Trump himself he put out this message yesterday he said congratulations to Elon Musk on his purchase of Twitter many people are saying that change was needed as the old manager was too concerned with the book agenda very true I have been told that my account will be back up and running on Monday we will see happy to be able to engage with an african-american-owned business oh my God that's so true Elon is from Africa wow guys this is so Progressive the biggest most influential social media site in the world is owned by an African-American this is pretty cool they're woke and they don't even know it we'll see if that actually happens if he comes back he has said previously that he didn't want to return to Twitter because he has truth social he thinks the truth social is better I I disagree I would rather be on Twitter I would rather have him on Twitter because I have been missing those tweets I've been missing some chef's kiss entertainment so I hope he comes back purely just to cause chaos but for now I will be keeping this energy this was posted by my friend James klug and it just kind of embodies everything that was going on last night it says me and the boys pulling up to Twitter to misgender people and post-crime statistics the fact that you couldn't even post facts on Twitter it's wild this is great it's going to be a wild ride regardless so to the good times do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that Bell so you never miss an episode", "0Ug6eyjeoiI": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I have not done a video like this in a while so I'm very excited we're going to read an article together because it is just too absurd not to and I wanted to do an entire segment about it because this is really just the sad state of Journalism in 2022 and I did not want to have to read it alone but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a comment section or off the clock video and of course if you want to check out my merch collection you can go to dailywire.com Brett so this is a pop sugar article came out yesterday so this is still fairly new it's still kind of Catching Fire on the Twitter webs but the title is fat people have sex too so why is it so hard to find contraception that works why is it so hard guys why uh the other title is how fat phobia impacts reproductive Health Care post row so of course we have to bring abortion to this because nobody has stopped talking about it they are still upset the summer of rage is apparently still going on even though thankfully they didn't burn down as many buildings as BLM they obviously did they burned out a lot of pregnancy centers and it was absolutely just reprehensible and disgusting but they did not rage as much as I was anticipating and worried about so that's good they're basically just sitting holed up in their houses writing articles like this because like I said journalism in 2022. the comments are just fantastic some of them guys I couldn't put on the show because they were just really mean like I think you know what those comments would be about fat contraception but they were just I didn't feel comfortable but you can go read them if you want uh but I'm not gonna do that on the show but somebody said I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's because they're fat fat is it yeah actually it is somebody said because condoms aren't cheap and readily available practically everywhere that isn't rural you know I kind of disagree with this because I feel like they're in every gas station like you can literally get them everywhere it is not difficult in 2022 to have safe sex it really is not like why are we even discussing this somebody said just trying to be relevant in a world of irrelevance yes exactly they are just trying to create problems so that they can complain and further their own victim culture so that they can continue being fat sad and lazy and having other people fix their problems somebody said it's happening they're finally running out of stupid [\u00a0__\u00a0] to write yeah imagine like being in these writers rooms and trying to you know figure out things that are oppressing them like the next thing we're gonna see is that apparently fat people can't buy cars because the car manufacturers are discriminating them because the seats are big enough but guys let me save you the hassle of writing that damn article because my new part owners at carzing are going to make sure that every person is able to find and buy a car that fits their individual needs so no oppression there carzing

oppressed victimized fat Libs would have anything to say about it which is impressive for sure let's dive into the article here are two of the authors one of them's name is Melanie and she is a queer writer in quarantine Melanie hi I'm Brett I just want you to know it's October of 2022. covet is over you can leave your house I understand that you were very scared but the world is okay you are going to be fine you can leave anyway she writes for pop sugar real simple refinery29 Apartment Therapy uh NPR Men's Health mags uh hello giggles all very profound Publications obviously uh this is the other writer Mia Patterson gotta feel mean they them writing new adult fantasy romance she is a queer Envy goddess and neurodivergent I just want you guys to know what we're getting into I just need you all to be prepared so if you're not excited yet just here we go so they start off with Roe v Wade obviously because we have to politicize this as quickly as possible they talk about how in the months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade many people have stepped forward to share their stories in order to help destigmatize abortion but despite all of the important discussions happening in the scotus decisions wake there's one conversation that has gone vastly underreported how the overturn of Roe v Wade is disproportionately impacting people in larger bodies that's what we're calling overweight people now number one they're body positive number two they just happen to be in larger bodies and then they talk about how certain types of contraception do not work for people that are more overweight especially the hormonal birth control because you would need a higher dosage and it does not work because your body is in flux because when you're overweight your hormones change and as a result a hormonal version of birth control just wouldn't be as effective that is not something that you need a science degree to understand at all they say research shows that people with a higher BMI are more likely to have lower HCG hormone levels at the beginning of a pregnancy which is the hormone that pregnancy tests detect so apparently because birth control does not work the only option for fat people is to use abortion as a form of birth control so we're still at the beginning of the article so get excited but the article is basically arguing that we need abortions because it is fat people's only option for birth control which is just ridiculous like are they that moronic like how about you try to live a healthier lifestyle that would actually save two lives if you even care about that sort of thing you and your potential unborn child that you would not have to abort because you'd be able to use effective birth control also the article literally contradicts itself in the first two paragraphs because they say and I quote as of right now the only emergency contraception that is effective regardless of body size is the copper IUD according to the American College of Obstetricians and gynecologists and IUD is not an emergency contraception you can get it in and it lasts for five to ten years and apparently it works for overweight people so why are we even writing this article your doctor should be able to say Hey listen I don't really think the pill is going to work for you I don't think the hormonal IUD is going to work for you but here is this great option that will work for your body why are we even having this conversation if there's literally something that works also guys understanding your cycle when you are fertile understanding your hormones that also is a very effective form of birth control also news flash not having sex if you do not have sex you will not have to worry about this so please be responsible and only open your legs when you are willing to have a child it's quite simple take the necessary precautions it's really not that difficult it is 2022. like that commenter said you can literally find condoms in a gas station and I can't believe that this is what I'm spending my life trying to teach people the article continues and they say that fat phobia is obviously not new in the healthcare industry because fat people are apparently discriminated by doctors and I'm guessing that it's because doctors tell them that they need to lose weight to be healthier guys that's not discrimination that is the doctor doing his or her job to protect you and help you so then they have a few sections uh the first one is how fat Fabia shows up in healthcare they say that fat phobia is rooted in a sense of blame and presumed moral failing which really I don't think so I think people are just trying to help you live a better and healthier life and the fact that we are glorifying being overweight and being unhealthy is utterly ridiculous and is just another example of how our society and Western Civilization is quickly decaying they then go on to why doesn't contraception work for all body sizes which we touched on in the first paragraph but if you have common sense you can probably understand why and then this is my favorite section he said the unique challenges facing larger body people post Roe v Wade here we go also body size often intersects with race particularly because structural racism contributes to higher bmis if you face racism apparently you're going to be fat they're checking every single marginalized intersectional box so that nobody can have any argument against it if I try to say anything to invalidate this article or the argument they're making they immediately have some well where marginalized Community you can't talk to us about this they will not respond to you with logic because they have basically created this protective wall around them where you cannot touch them because they are a protected class because they are fat and they deal with racism and they're a woman and they're probably also trans and non-binary and all of that crap they go on and they start quoting another PhD Dr Lindberg who apparently focuses on addressing the systemic disparities in sexual and reproductive health and rights which have become increasingly under threat in this legal landscape this doctor says women of color are more likely to be categorized as larger bodies so these policies and practices risk becoming racist therefore all of these concerns are much more likely to impact women of color this includes health risks during pregnancy and higher morbidity rates related to delivery and in the months postpartum that's another utter lie where they say oh so many black women die giving birth really like no I think Candace actually has a whole episode on that you should go listen to it so then they finish out the article by basically saying how can you advocate for yourself to get better care news flash I don't think that they write this in the article but you can ask before I copyright UD that's what we've learned from this article what I've taken away is that one sentence in the second paragraph that disproves everything they have written but obviously they don't want to talk about that and then they finish out the article by saying we need to have more conversations around discriminatory stipulations on medical devices and medications and urge the healthcare industry to develop inclusive options because the burden shouldn't only be on the patients themselves it'll take much wider societal change to end fat phobia and ensure that all people can get the inclusive Health Care they deserve I'm sorry it is the patient's responsibility to also take accountability for their health you cannot just show up and be ill and not taking care of yourself and just expect your doctor to immediately be able to fix everything it does not work that way yes they should be able to prescribe treatment and medication that might work but you have to step up and take responsibility for your life and your health if you are not doing that there is nobody to blame except yourself and the moment that you start taking responsibility you will be so much happier you'll be so much more empowered because this victim culture it is killing you quickly one because it is morally and emotionally degrading but also because apparently these people are just sitting around being fat and unhealthy and sad and that's killing you faster than anything else hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "TTJHfSbUadg": "thank you [Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock I'm obviously not in my studio I am back with Lucas here at T-Rex arms we're gonna do another video today we're going to talk about body armor because people are worried about crime worried about self-defense we're obviously worried about the things that are going on in other countries Foreign Affairs and people want to know about this so I'm going to throw it over to you yeah so there's a couple things about body armor in particular so as the gun community and this is something that I found interesting journalists have started to reach out they've started to recognize that the gun Community isn't just buying guns they're also now interested in buying this stuff the nursing buying body armor helmets night vision and other equipment like that the farmers industry is evolving people are starting to recognize that the Second Amendment isn't just about hunting it's not just about Bambi it could be about something far worse than say home defense and they realize that just owning a rifle might not be enough and whenever we have rolled events such as the very peaceful time of 2020 was actually a great time for people to recognize the need for owning mostly peaceful we recognize the need for help having body armor to complement their rifle we sell body armor and we saw a huge uptick in body armor sales and new people coming by our website emailing us going stuff's going down I need equipment for it what do I buy [Music] [Music] so one of the biggest differences of shooting when it comes to wearing body armor or plate carriers is sometimes the plate because you're wearing it nice and high to protect your vitals can sometimes get in the way of the stock but the main thing we're looking for is having that really good stock placement nice and firm in our shoulder pocket it might be touching the plate carrier just a little bit or the plate for this rifle we've got right here is a mark 18 or also kind of known as a cqbr so this is the short version of the rifle that gets issued to U.S Special Operations so we're going to be using that and it's got the laser light red dot combo so if you want to go ahead and slang up we'll go ahead and get shooting is it over here and then this one so usually yep just like that okay it's almost like she's done this before nice one more time looks really good stand by it's good it's like I want to bring it in closer I think it's actually like wearing this is better training in a way because it's forcing me to you know square up more and know where I'm putting it because I think without this it's easier to slide around so this is actually a good buffer yep you're having to really roll really roll the shoulder into the stock and by Rolling the shoulder in it also helps prevent the gun from kind of pushing out because if you start shooting sort of at this angle right here it's really easy to let the gun Trail off versus no I actually want to trap the stock so that it's only coming backwards so the gun's not running off to the side [Music] So Soft armor typically stops pistol rounds and fragmentation from certain explosives at certain distances and then you have hard plates kind of call of duty-esque these will defeat various rifle calibers based on the make of the plate the thickness the material and whatnot so typically speaking this is what people are interested in buying because they realize whoa A lot of people have rifles it's not just handguns I need something else and when you go and buy a hard rifle plate such as this one the Hesco l210 you will need some sort of vest or Carrier it's called a plate carrier to actually have that armor plate inside and there's tons of variations and types of plate carriers out there this is one that we manufacture the ac1 it's a slick minimalist carrier that you can wear under a jacket you can wear under a hoodie for depending on how peaceful the the time is that you need armor and then if you want to build it out a little bit more overt have some magazines to go with it have your medical equipment your radio your Communications you can do that and sort of flex it between both of those roles but basically the way it works is there is a plate pocket on each side of the carrier that you could drop your plate into sized accordingly to that plate carrier and then you're ready to go throw that on size it to your body and you're set So Soft armor for pistol rounds kind of a simple way to look at it rifle plates hard plates for your rifle calibers moving down here these are a couple military style military issue plate carriers just for some examples this is the cry JPC it's sort of a kind of a slick kind of similar in size to the ac1 but you can kind of put some more stuff on it which is nice and this actually has side plates if you want more protection this is a a 3A side panel soft plate that can go on the side here and the thing about armor that a lot of folks you know they look at a plate like this and they go ah this thing's tiny you need to protect more of your body well the purpose for body armor is just to protect your vitals you're just wearing it over your lungs and your heart you're not trying to protect your stomach if you have a long torso they don't make long armor you don't size arm or lengthwise you size it width-wise so you're never going to actually protect your entire body [Music] [Music] thank you foreign citizens and whether or not you decide to invest in any of this or not this is all information that I think is important to know especially as the world is getting increasingly crazy and it's just good to be educated so happy to have him here and there is one misconception a lot of people when they look at this they go why would I want this for home defense and the answer is you're right you're probably not going to put on body armor at 3am when someone's breaking through your door you're not going to have time necessarily to put on all your kit you know turn off all lights in the house put on night vision it's not for home defense per se it's more for again those scenarios that are in some ways a little trickier a little more difficult a little more difficult to make decisions on you know like the what was going on in 2020 it is a little bit more proactive in wearing that equipment it's not something you necessarily use for home defense and that's where there's a lot of misconception about body armor people who only focus on home defense they probably don't need body armor it's for people that want to be prepared for those other scenarios outside of just the home defense or carrying a pistol when they go out in public that's what the body armor or night vision or helmet or four it's for something honestly that could become much worse like if you live in Portland per se that could be exactly [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] guys well this was super fun Lucas thank you for having me back out here again I hope you guys learned a little bit about body armor that it doesn't seem so intimidating and I hope you enjoyed some of those cool action shots which are my very favorite thing about doing

to miss a thing", "WrRk09_Wfek": "what's up guys welcome back to ghost hunters sorry uh comment section i'm brad cooper not a awful joke i just did is because today we're talking about the paranormal i really don't have a way to introduce this story to you because it's so random so let's just get into it earlier this week vanessa hudgins went on the kelly clarkson show and her fascination with ghosts was brought up apparently she speaks to them uh check out this headline this is what i saw on twitter first vanessa hudgins says that she speaks to spirits quote something that i have the ability to do so is it true that you have a new passion in life are you obsessed with ghosts i hear you it's not really a new passion okay we're just finding out you're just kind of like finding out okay yeah i feel like i've i've accepted the fact that like i i see things and i hear things really you've had like experiences yeah a lot of them and i kind of shut it down for a while because like it's scary like yeah the unknown is scary so you can't yeah but i recently was like no this is like a gift and like something that i have the ability ability to do so i'm gonna lean into it and i recently did my first like real paranormal investigation like with equipment and everything this is like real life ghostbusters what is that thing you're doing it's technical it's one of our little toys this is like it like vanessa hudgins desperately wanted to be in the female ghostbusters was not cass and is like damn it i'll do it myself like my favorite thing is called the spirit box okay and it basically scans radio frequencies really quickly oh i was sitting at a a tombstone in a graveyard with my best friend because that's what we do that's what well if you're trying to find ghosts like the graveyard yeah um and this is at nighttime or night time wow we're different and we found this one tombstone of a spirit that we were told is very playful um so i turn it on i'm like hi sam i'm vanessa this is gigi sam can you tell us our names what are our names and then we just hear shh vanessa shh no you have to like tell them to stay because you don't want spirits to follow you or do you no you don't no no we're trying to live like you know without that so we don't need that all the time when i was about give or take six years old and my grandfather just died i convinced myself that i could speak to him i remember holding seances in my dining room while my mom would be in the kitchen cookie and i would like collect all the candles in the house i would sit there and i would like try to like summon it i wasn't even i wasn't even that close to him i don't know i just got it in my head that like we were connected thank god my mom never got me like a ouija board or anything like that and just let my like psychic phase run its course but i mean that's when i was six years old i grew out of it that's not something i really i really kept going and clearly as you'll see later in this segment some people have not been so fortunate but anyway into the comments because they're very funny one person goes i get it i respect it but it sounds like both like i totally buy that some people have gifts like these i think it can be real i think it it's probably very very rare but vanessa hudgens no one vanessa hutchins hey they're demons it's me a boy hey there demons it's me your boy she said i got a ghost my own way uh can we play a clip from that song i gotta go in my own way gonna tell my kids this is vanessa hudgens yeah literally the first thing i thought of was sixth sense okay so this next one i'm gonna show you it cracked me up but i think most people are gonna need a little backstory or maybe you're all caught up on this stuff but here just watch this first it's a tweet with a video on it vanessa hudgens running from the ghost that died from kovid at the beginning of coven vanessa was blacklisted and got a wee bit cancelled um because she posted a video on her instagram story where she was giving some honestly common sense complaints about lockdowns and the virus people were real mad uh but i found the video here we go um yeah till july it sounds like a bunch of  i'm sorry but like it's a virus i get it like i respect it but at the same time like even if everybody gets it like yeah people are gonna die it's just terrible but like inevitable i don't know maybe i shouldn't be doing this right now the whole thing is just ridiculous because she's just a character anyway obviously people were pissed at her because she was questioning the narrative i mean she did a public apology the whole shebang and i mean listen maybe she could have been dad more eloquent and empathetic rather than saying like people are gonna die that was a terrible impression first demi with the aliens now vanessa hutchins with the ghosts who will be next this might be what i am most excited to talk about vanessa is far from the only celebrity who is communicating with other worldly beings demi lovato who is now non-binary i think she has new show on peacock where she they goes and tries to answer questions about extraterrestrial life early this fall was in september a clip came out from the show and it went viral you might have seen it and it's probably one of the greatest things to ever be produced someone tweeted the clip that i found and said the demi lovato ghost alien hunting show is so unbelievably good she just drives around the country with her up gay friend and sister doing mental health with the supernatural highly recommend that's that's like that's the best description of the show that i could give you okay obviously i didn't watch the rest of the show i didn't need to i just need to watch this clip so we're gonna watch it together okay she has trauma she does uh-huh okay how do that's why she doesn't like men okay okay i respect that i respect that how how did she get from that she has drama maybe if you sang that sing a song as an offering week we could come back in the room oh yeah yeah okay if i sing you a song can my friends come back in the room [Music] there you go there you go cool well i always think skyscraper when i feel sure singing something emotional for people [Applause] [Music] do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me you can take everything like i'm made of paper go on and try to tear me down i will be rising from the ground like a skyscraper i don't know what that was the comments on this video are divine imagine being a demonic ghost minding your own business and then suddenly a non-binary person labeled you a female star person that has drama with men and it proceeds to sing you skyscraper do you dislike boys would have been my most important question to ask an alien being too i mean what other information could possibly be more important than knowing that top-notch interview like the whole premise of the show is she's setting out to get answers about extraterrestrial life clearly asking the hard-hitting questions here it's like cnn but paranormal edition i respect that i respect that if i was a ghost and i found out that the person trying to summon me was demi lovato i just wouldn't be summoned okay also look at this interview clip i found while i was doing research now that you've made contact with et's maybe not this kind of context just yet not yet but if there was an e.t that hit every box of criteria that would be like the most ideal partner like would you date an e2 yes absolutely i'm so tired of humans i am so tired of humans and they're human bull she says she would date any tea [Music] again i feel like i say this a lot but like we can laugh at this but it's also just sad like demi has obviously had very public problems with drugs and abuse and severe mental health issues and i empathize with that more than you know but this industry is just parading demi around letting her act like this and encouraging it normalizing the behavior because that's what we do these days rather than saying hey this person probably really needs help probably needs a really strong support system and doesn't need us to be driving her around the country talking to star people my last little button for this segment is that while i was going through these videos and comments yesterday i thought that it was just vanessa and demi you thought wrong there is another former hollywood child star who's going out to seek ghosts kristen stewart is developing a gay ghost hunting reality show with a friend which she has described as a paranormal romp in a queer space with elevated aesthetics that's just what we need i mean that's just like the most 20 22 thing i have ever heard there was a comment on this tweet and i i can't tell whether this is satire or not which is how i feel most things these days if you can't understand that the paranormal is an essential element of the queer experience and all ghosts are inherently part of the lgbtq plus spectrum you need to sit down and make room for native posthumous voices i mean come on that has to be satire it's too it's too perfect maybe she'll get possessed by a demon that can actually give a convincing performance she's so bad i shouldn't say that but she just looks high in every single thing that she does i will try harder next time it's genuinely hysterical this might have been one of my favorite episodes we've ever done and it's an absolute train wreck but these are three young women who i grew up watching and knowing and seeing on red carpets who were seemingly like chewed up and spit out by the hollywood machine i mean granted some of them are doing better than others like vanessa hutchins seems like she's still like semi put together but it's just an interesting through line through the story that i genuinely did not expect when i first started putting this together all i can say is thank god i made it 10 years as a child actor in hollywood without spiraling it's honestly an accomplishment i respect that i respect that hopefully i didn't jinx myself like knock on wood do you want to be the only person that is not

comment section i'm brett cooper you know i was thinking about it and we haven't really had a good feud on the show in a while there's always people protesting there's always people trying to cancel other people that's basically the norm these days but i have not seen a good back and forth online until today i was scrolling and i saw that jojo siwa reveals that full house star candace cameron burr is the rudest celebrity she has ever met so obviously i'm guessing most people know who candace cameron burr is if you do not she was an actress in full house she then came back and did fuller house she's in a lot of hallmark movies she's a very open christian conservative which is not the norm in hollywood and then jojo siwo was on dance moms and she became super popular after dance moms she was following a tick tock trend which is where you expose people on your phone and you're like this is the worst person i've ever met be like show this is the best person i've ever met this is my secret crush anyway i know i've said it before it's not fun to explain trends but i feel like sometimes it's necessary because not everybody wants to be on the chinese communist app tick-tock so i try to shine some light anyway here's the video [Music] so it seems pretty harmless but they managed to slow down the video and take a screenshot of the rudest celebrity i've ever met frame and they all realized that it was candace cameron burr and thus the social media beef was created and i love this almost as much as i like actual beef from good ranchers and just so you know their product is even

your photos on social media tag me tag goodranchers i want to see what you're cooking and i will do the same but back to the real meat of the issue candace burr responded candace's car chronicles special edition uh because i want to talk about the jojo situation honestly i was shocked when i saw the tick tock on sunday and had no idea where it came from and so i immediately tried to reach out to her through a mutual friend and my publicist contacted her manager and i dm'd her because i didn't know what happened what i didn't know and um so i was finally able to talk to jojo this morning i called her we had a great conversation and and she was like hey how you doing and i kind of said well i've been better um what happened and and she said ah you know i didn't think this was gonna go viral and they were gonna pick that up it was such a just a silly tick tock trend um i said because i only remember that we met at the kelly clarkson show and that went really great and she goes yeah i know it was great and you're super nice and all of that she said she actually didn't want to tell me because she said it's so silly she felt bad and that's why it just wasn't a big deal to her but then she said you know i met you at the fuller house premiere and i was 11 years old and we were all on the red carpet and when i had i had come up to you and i said can i have a picture with you and you said to me not right now and then proceeded to do what you were doing and take pictures with other people on the red carpet and i was like oh jojo i'm i'm so sorry and she's like yeah no no you weren't even mean and she goes and i get it now as an adult when you're on the red carpet and everything's happening and you're being pulled in different directions but at that time i was 11 and i go and i kind of broke your 11 year old heart i didn't take a picture with you and i was like oh i feel crummy i feel jojo i'm so sorry i'm so sorry and she was like it's seriously not a big deal but i do remember that and i said okay i said but please know especially as a mom uh it breaks my heart that i made you feel that way and and i'm sorry to your mom too that i did that to her daughter because i know if anyone crosses my kids like mama bear comes out and so we had a really great discussion and she basically said like i didn't even think that was gonna get picked up and a big deal and so that was it all good all good on the jojo front and i you know i think the lesson that we can learn is to to be mindful that no matter how many followed followers you have you know even a 10 second trending tick tock video can do damage because our words matter and our actions matter and whether you have 50 million followers or 500 followers or five followers we all influence the people around us you know we shared our our joy for one another and that we are both positive encouraging people and i told jojo how much i've always appreciated her because uh she has been a good role model because of her positivity i'm just gonna say on a side note if you've ever personally run into me and i was not the person you were hoping for or expecting i just want to say i'm sorry i'm sorry sorry in the sense that i get asked for photos and autographs often and 99 of the time it is my joy to do that it is my joy to talk to people and say hi and all that but i'm still a human being all public people are and sometimes you have bad days i just hope that we could all have grace for one another and um you know there may be one moment in your life and you may have been that person that wasn't at their best or you may have been on the receiving end of someone that wasn't at their best but that shouldn't define the person in their character if it's a one-time thing and it's not it's the consistency of their lives okay so i apologize because i know that that was a bit of a longer video but i think it was really important i know i set this up as being some kind of internet beef whatever and it is because the internet pitted these women against each other obviously she sparked this whole thing with the tick tock but candace burr really is a class act she always has been she's always held herself well i don't know her i've never come in contact with her but on social media she has always seemed respectful seemed kind and this was an incredible way to handle it she did not you know apologize in some weak way she went out of her way to try to mend this bridge and have an adult conversation with jojo and obviously i think we all know you know what jojo posted it was a bit childish even if it was innocent she's been on the internet long enough to know that anything that you post people will pick apart and try to hate you for it try to pit you against other people if she did not think that people were going to slow down that video and see that it was candace burr i don't know what to tell you so i really don't know what her intent was but after being on the internet for that long it feels kind of like a miss on her part but even with all of that canisburg held herself so well it was very kind and i love the way she handled it then jojo was spotted running errands and page six asked her a few questions about it so these are her thoughts on it every single person in the world wants to know what did she do what did she do come on come on i had a i had a rough experience when i was little i was 11 and i was a big big fan and i wanted to take a picture with her and it wasn't a good time for her i will say because i had a bad experience that doesn't mean that she's an awful human i think it just was a inconvenient time for her and a little 11 year old me was just so pumped up and so excited but that doesn't mean she's the worst human ever again i really i don't understand what is going on she's acting like she's smiling she's saying oh she's not an awful human being even though i literally just said online that she is the rudest celebrity i've ever met it wasn't a big deal she's not she's not an awful human but it was a rough experience for me now i have some thoughts i'll go ahead and tell you now i do think that it might be political because like i said candace burr is very outspokenly conservative which broke the hearts of millions of people who love full house love fuller house because she is very outspoken with her faith with her politics which is totally fine that is her prerogative i love that she is because i love seeing people who are you know against the grade but still working in the entertainment industry but it's caused a lot of people to burn bridges with her and i don't know if maybe jojo wanted to hop on this trend i was trying to think of somebody who was rude and thought oh this is an easy one because people don't like her because of her politics and i have a personal experience and my heart is also broken because i love full house but i'm angry that she you know was conservative that's kind of my thought is that it was just an easy grab for her and now the spotlight is on her she's having to actually explain it and she's kind of embarrassed that the only bad experience she had with candace was when she was 11 years old and candace could not take a picture on the red carpet it feels like she got caught other people were a lot more heated than i am about all of this somebody said our national nightmare has come to a close candace cameron burr has apologized to jojo siwa and this is what it looks like i mean yeah guys we were all shaking in our boots about this the 19 year old lesbian uh dance mom star versus the 40 year old full house conservative star it's basically ufc for social media users uh somebody else said god i mean these are the people that just bother me so much candace cameron burr is the perfect representation of every conservative woman i've known beautiful upbeat sticks up for family values and christian values prides herself on being so so so so nice but is actually just a raging dumb like why why also that seems more like jealousy than anything well they're so pretty and they they claim that they care about family then their did you even listen to her apology give me a break stop with the stereotypes somebody said giving republican vibes wow classic that's innovative other people were pointing out that jojo siwa has 40 million followers and candace only has four wild that the girl who grew up on social media has more than the girl who grew up in the 80s and was on a 90s show somebody else said tbh i feel like candace cameron burr would hate crime me and my friends why because she's conservative these people are so brainwashed by our culture by social media by the mainstream media by people in their lives that they genuinely think the people who are christian that lean more conservative are actually just inherently terrible people they are not someone said candace is a christian conservative so it's no surprise that was literally all of the comments so that kind of solidifies my idea that maybe jojo just picked her because of her politics because it was an easy get and then people just immediately latched on that and made it so big i don't think that this would be as big of a deal if she was not conservative but people already have reason to hate candace so they're going to go after her and it's absurd to close this out this person said thanks pop crave i woke up today wondering this exact thing i said i wonder what jojo thinks is the rudest celebrity she's ever met and now i have my answer so glad you told us all i mean sometimes that's how i feel i'm like do people really want to hear about this but i want to talk about it and you have ears so you're going to listen so there's your social media b for the day obviously it's not that juicy good rancher's meat is much juicier but i enjoyed the political intersection of this because people are idiots and candace cameron burr is a class act do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "5XyZagwqNPo": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper so I think you guys all know but I lived in California for about 10 years I left last year and I was just talking to sheller about it because sheller and I were from the same city in LA and I don't miss Los Angeles I don't miss California because that state and that place is just a dumpster fire what kind of big but we both have like nostalgic memories of growing up in Southern California and there are times when I find myself kind of Yearning For That period of my life but then I see stories like this and I have the most intense wave of gratitude I've ever felt because I no longer live in that hellhole but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already a ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection this was trending yesterday and it's kind of sad because it didn't even shock me and I say this a lot but I'm so numb to some of these things now nothing on the outside nothing on the inside you know sometimes I do have to take a step back and say no this is objectively awful I don't care if you're numb because you see this crap on the internet all the time it is disgusting and it deserves to be ripped into so that is what we're gonna do today California has become the first Sanctuary state for transgender youth seeking Medical Care Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law in September that ensures that transgender kids from elsewhere can safely access hormones or puberty blockers here the legislation also Shields family from child abuse investigations or from being criminally prosecuted for seeking gender affirming care now I want to know immediately does this protect parents who say hey maybe I don't want my 10 year old to transition maybe I don't want my 10 year old to be able to go and get gender affirming care probably not because in California there have been multiple cases of children being ripped away from their parents because their parents have common sense and realize my 10 year old probably doesn't know that they're transgender they probably don't want to do irreversible damage to their body at 10 years and like this headline briefly touched on this bill also applies to Paris and children coming in from out of state so even if you live in a state where gender affirming care for kids hormone therapy top bottom surgery is illegal for minors you can still go to California and get that treatment and be protected California really is just the worst of the worst and they are trying to push this harmful Progressive agenda any way that they possibly can people in the comments are not thrilled about it I saw a few big articles one from KQED news and one from NPR and all the comments were pretty based somebody said Medical Care seems like a loose term I don't think that they're talking about therapy rather surgery and medication which should not be given to youth uh parentheses children another person said this won't survive the first round of lawsuits which will likely be coming from other states the law feels like it's tailor-made to encourage kidnapping and child trafficking also a great point but of course mixed in with these people that have common sense and are interested in protecting children there are people like this this person said always a relief for minority demographics to find non-biased non-prejudiced safe havens especially within vulnerable privacies what does that even mean all of you people just write random tweets expecting us all to get it you're just using big Progressive virtue signaling words to make no rational Point whatsoever minority demographics what is the minority demographic here confused children with groomer parents that's not really a minority demographic I'm trying to protect other than getting those kids away from those parents and doctors another person said um based let's go Gavin hashtag trans flag okay first of all that username is horrifying but also Christina I don't think you know what the word based means it's definitely not bad what gavinism is doing is as far from base as you can absolutely get one of the authors of the bill jumped on Twitter to celebrate his name is Scott weiner you gotta be freaking kidding just gonna let that sit there nobody likes that and nobody really likes him so that kind of adds up he said California's new transgender State Refuge law SB 107 which I authored sends a powerful message to trans kids and their families that they will be safe here even as other states criminalize their families in their very existence it's not criminalization it's literally just protecting them in their innocence you freaking wiener but I was very happy to see the people in the comments were calling him on his [\u00a0__\u00a0] this guy said just groomer another person said you are such a creep another person said oh look we ain't promoting more sexualization of children so surprising and yes all of those comments are incredibly accurate but this is not the only child sexualization California law that is circulating Twitter right now and not the only child sexualization California law that Scott weiner has helped author and I can't believe that there is even one but that is the creepy disgusting world that we live in users began posting this Breitbart headline this woman said what does this even mean and it says California legislator passes Bill reducing penalties for oral anal sex with willing children and the mainstream media has been freaking out just based on like three tweets from Big accounts asking hey what the hell is going on in California this is a really disgusting looking bill and instantaneously the mainstream media started issuing fact checks because they want to convince everyone that number one this is false number two remind everybody that this is really nothing to be alarmed about because this bill was pushed through in 2020. so it's old news why are we even talking about it move on no I I don't care whether it was pushed through or authored in 2020 or 1995 or 2005 if it is still standing and people didn't know about it we did not talk about it then yes it is worth being alarmed about so that maybe we can do something about it this was trending this morning it said California's 2020 Senate Bill 145 aims to eliminate inequality in sex offender registration requirements says fact Checkers I don't want to eliminate inequality in sex offenders if you're a sex offender I don't care about your equality I care that you're on that list so that children stay away from you you're not a protected minority that I really care about and then AP tweeted out this fact check from August and they said post spread old Claim about California's sex crimes bill and the claim is that California governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill reducing penalties for sodomy with minors now that's pretty straightforward but they are actively trying to convince people that this bill does not do that that it does not reduce penalties for sex with willing children but then look what AP themselves writes literally underneath that claim the bill expanded an existing state law that already gave judges such discretion in cases of voluntary but illegal vaginal sex between a minor ages 14 to 17 and an adult within 10 years of the Minor's age as the Associated Press previously reported the bill broadened that discretion to also apply in cases of voluntary oral and anal sex within the same age parameters great wonderful California thank you they continue and say when California lawmakers passed the bill some falsely claimed it would legalize pedophilia sort of what it sounds like it's doing they continue on and they say but the bill did not make sex with miners legal it also did not apply to cases where a minor is under the age of 14 and when the age Gap is larger than 10 years or when either party says the sex was not consensual so basically there was already a California law in place that if you were 14 to 18 years old and you had consensual sex with somebody that was under 10 years older than you that was totally fine and then California legislators decided that there was just too much inequality in here so they wanted to expand it to then oral and anal sex why are they sitting around thinking pondering the consequences of having oral anal or vaginal sex with 14 year old children that is disgusting those are pedophiles Point Blank do not care what you think here's a section from the actual build was posted this is not the AP this is the actual verbatim from California it says the bill states that non-forcible sodomy oral copulation and sexual penetration with a minor do not require mandatory Sex Offender Registration unless there is a more than 10-year gap between the minor and the other person however a court may still require registration if it deems appropriate these offenses when committed without Force where the minor was a willing participant and under the age of 14 are sometimes referred to as hofshire offenses what I'm going back in the oven I have no words like this is one of the most disgusting things I have ever read this is legal in California like we're not talking about the death penalty here that's a totally different conversation we're not even talking about chemically castrating or cutting off their balls which you know in my opinion they deserve we're talking about simply adding them to the sex offender registry but no that's that's discriminatory that's just that's too intense I don't care if you think it is consensual sex with a 14 or a 15 year old it is still gross it is still illegal if you are eight years older than a 14 year old and you think you're having consensual sex with them you are sick in the head that child probably does not know any better and you are a creepy groomer and California is protecting those people and according to good old Scott weiner who co-authored this bill he sees the bill as an anti-discrimination bill for lgbtq plus people so that they don't automatically get listed on the sex offender list what the was that a problem that we needed to solve and bro it's also pretty discriminatory of you to assume that gay people need that you're insinuating that they're all groomers that they're part of the problem so if you think you're getting you know Progressive brownie points protecting gay people no you're actually just insinuating that they're all having sex with children there are some disgusting pedophilic grooming people in this country and I don't care about their sexuality if they are doing that to Children put them on that sex offender list you are literally trying to excuse a pedophilic law through the rationalization of it's under the protection of gay people truly the logic they are using to rationalize all of this is gross and it's weak so for the people that are asking what is going on that they're so confused that they're worried about all of this this commenter sums it up perfectly she says it means that California is not a safe place for children it's not it's really not a safe place for anybody right now you see the homelessness you see the crime spikes you see the drug usage and now you see what they are okay happening to Children this is a hill that I am 100 comfortable dying on this is where I draw the line in the sand I don't care about your opinions on the economy or other policy but if you are okay physically harming children and rationalizing it through a progressive woke agenda I'm disgusted I I do not care if we disagree on other policy as moral respectable people who value life you have to see that this is wrong if this doesn't wake people up I've lost hope like our society is so far gone and I hate that that's where this episode is gone because usually I like to laugh about this stuff I like to usually you know have some fun some casual mockery but this is not even something we can mock because it is so despicable so I'm going to leave you with this if you were in California if you have the financial means to get out of that state to protect your children it's time to start doing that because this is only getting worse do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make

is the day after election day and I know for a fact that this is not the red tsunami the huge red wave that people were anticipating energy levels are low people are either confused about what's going on they're disappointed they don't know what to do I still believe that there are positives and there are things we can learn from this so we're going to talk about that today but before we get into

they have fully put themselves on the map as a red State they are no longer a swing state they're not purple they're not blue whatever they are 100 Republican the santis absolutely crushed it it was very exciting to see Abbott and Kemp also easily won in their states which is exciting and Sarah Huckabee Sanders absolutely he swept Arkansas she is now their first female governor we also made strides in the house like guys this is not the worst night I've ever seen oh great not terrible I think conservatives really hyped up the Red Wave because obviously people are very disgruntled with the state of the country and with Biden we thought that that would translate at the polls it didn't that just means we have more work to do we gotta reset we gotta adapt we gotta up this productivity

friend Sabrina described it I think that was a perfect way to encapsulate how I was feeling I was trying to take some time to process everything this morning which I feel like a lot of people are doing and what was making me feel that way and I boiled it down to this I am less concerned with the fact that we didn't have an insane Nationwide red tsunami that we didn't win legislatively and we're concerned that we have to live amongst people who are so caught up in identity politics and being politically correct that they won't vote across party lines for the mean Republicans even when they see that everything is literally going to [\u00a0__\u00a0] they lived through coveted lockdowns vaccine mandates Biden's economy the childhood transgender craze and thought nope no need to make a change here everything is just beachy just fine that is the thing that concerns me the most I don't know if it is that they're too afraid but that the people are not making any moves that obviously brings me back to culture which is what I care about most I guess a lot of people just don't have the fire under their asses that we do and that just means we have to keep going and it's interesting to see that the people who won big last night and won easily were the people who went all in on cultural issues that did not hold back these were not squishy moderates as Michael Knowles likes to say these were strong leaders who are unwavering in their beliefs unwilling to compromise and who brought cultural issues to the political Battlefront unapologetically it's very evident that that is what we need to do and obviously some ballots are still being counted and people have a lot of different opinions about what went wrong what we need to change but I do see a glimmer of hope on the cultural side of things because people are realizing that this is where the real fight is happening but I did see some pretty practical takes that seem really based so I wanted to share some of those with you Ali Beth Stuckey said pretty incredible that the will make you poorer and less safe it will let you kill your baby message seems to work for a lot of people if we learn one thing it is that you can talk about policy and traditional political things all day long inflation gas prices Foreign Affairs whatever but what is working right now are the cultural issues that is where you have to punch back Sexton said people who voted for John fetterman are why reality and rationality no longer matters in politics it is just party identity and raw power and I would add culture into that and I think it kind of is intermixed with party identity and raw power but getting back to the reality and rationality thing we can talk about facts and statistics all day long and those are important and that gets you kind of halfway but we're dealing with humans here and in order to motivate humans you have to appeal to them emotionally you have to tell stories you have to communicate to them in an effective way that makes them want to come over to your side that is what the left is so good at and we lose because we're just sitting around talking about gas prices which I mean is important but we're seeing that that is not what is changing people's minds sometimes I think is this all there is is life just some kind of horrific joke without a punch line that we're all just biting our time until the sweet sweet release of death Sour Patch lid said I guess I'm glad crime doesn't seem to be worrying many voters yeah I actually thought I was kind of wrong on this crime and people's safety that is something that would emotionally drive me to change the way I would vote in order to protect myself and protect my family apparently it really doesn't matter to people apparently those crime statistics mean nothing so I think that's somewhere where we could also change our tune here's Hillary Clinton just solidifying all of this saying it turns out women enjoy having human rights and we vote they literally have spent the last six months inserting abortion into every single political talking point we've talked about it a lot Joe Biden bringing it up every chance he gets Stacey Abrams saying the only reason people care about gas prices is because they don't have Reproductive Rights they have literally included it in everything and it worked because it is emotionally driven it is emotionally charged and you know what it was an effective tactic I was actually talking with somebody on our staff right before I started filming and she told me that her brother last night told her that he voted red all the way down his ballot except in the gubernatorial race because he wanted a pro-choice Governor that was the defining factor for him they are voting on single issues because it is emotionally charged because they literally put it into every single political conversation shut up it's infuriating and it is exhausting that this actually is effective but it just shows that this is something we need to get better at and in light of all of these results I've seen a lot of people actually on the you know more right-wing conservative side of Twitter start changing their tune immediately when things started not going our way and before they were you know all about we have to win we have to win we have to have the right way we gotta you know get all of these seats to immediately well we can't really trust politicians they weren't going to do anything anyway to basically be black pilled and honestly that all just seemed very disingenuous to me because you know you've been screaming at me on Twitter to go vote and all these politicians are going to save me and now you're saying never mind it doesn't really matter and if you watch my show and if you've been listening to the things that I've been saying for the last nine or ten months you know that I really try to stay philosophically consistent and one of the things that I am consistent on is that contrary to what the left wants you to believe at the end of the day the government is not here to save you politicians are not here to save you you are still in control of your life it's up to you to decide not to be a victim it's up to you to be self-reliant it is up to you to make sure that you are not dependent upon the government that is how you actually protect yourself and on this broader scale it is abundantly clear that we need to change our tactics and we have to fight on an emotional and cultural level if we actually want to make change that is going to impact us on a day-to-day basis if we don't this is just going to keep happening thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this channel turn on your

section I'm Brett Cooper today guys we're gonna be talking about everyone's favorite royal couple I guess technically they are the ex royal couple Prince Harry and Meghan Markle now I know a lot of people think that it is just trendy to hate Megan and to hate Harry but I actually do have specific criticisms for this ex royal couple I think the Meghan Markle is a stunning human being I loved following the royal family but I just think that they are utterly ridiculous and today we're going to talk about the newest ridiculous thing they have done before we get into that story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course if you want more content you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper okay so they are doing yet another publicity stunt I guess they are releasing a Netflix docu-series now this was announced earlier in the year I think but it didn't get a ton of traction because I think people were hoping that it would just go away or that it wouldn't happen and a couple of weeks ago they dropped the first like teaser trailer and I got you know a little bit of movement on social media but this week they announced the date that it was going to be released and they did the full trailer so we're gonna watch that because it's getting oh that's really bad a lot of people are talking about it and there is some kind of weird stuff that's in here anyway all right it's really hard to look back on it now and go what on Earth happened you hear that that is a sign of Hearts breaking all around the world [Applause] [Music] a royal rock star and then everything changed there's a hierarchy of the family you know there's leaking but there's also planting of stories there was a war against Megan to suit other people's agendas it's about hatred it's about race it's a dirty game and suffering of women marrying into this institution this feeling Frenzy no one knows the full truth we know the full truth drama now obviously it is common knowledge that the Press follows the royal family and often there have been invasions of privacy they have overstepped overreach I mean just think about Princess Diana but by using these fake Clips they're completely discrediting their cries about the invasion of their privacy and their concerns about their security and this is actually something that they should be concerned about we should all be concerned about our privacy and security which is why I use expressvpn because it's scary that the same company who controls half of online retail also passively eavesdrops on our private conversations at home and the fact that a single company controls 90 of internet searches runs our email service and gets to track everything we do on our smartphones big Tech is more powerful than most countries are and they profit by exploiting your personal data so it is time to put a layer of protection between your online activity and these Tech Juggernauts and that is why I use expressvpn I mean think about how much of your life is on the internet every site you visit every video you watch every message you sent it gets tracked in data mined I mean that's terrifying to me considering the horrendous things I search online for the show but when I'm running expressvpn on my devices their software hides my IP address something the big Tech uses to personally identify me and you expressvpn makes your activity harder to trace and harder to sell to advertisers expressvpn also encrypts 100 of your internet data to keep you safe from hackers and eavesdroppers on your network and they do all of this without slowing your connection that is why it was rated the number one VPN service by Mashable and techradar and on top of all of the security and protection that they offer I also love that expressvpn is so easy to use you just download the app on your phone or your computer you just turn it on with a click of a button and you are instantly protected so stop handing over your personal data to the big Tech Monopoly that Minds your activity and sells your information protect yourself with a VPN that I trust to keep me safe online visit expressvpn.com Cooper to get three extra months free again that is expressvpn.com Cooper right now to learn more maybe I can send this link to good old Harry and Megan and they can stop bitching and moaning about all their security concerns now I'm obviously before I get into you know some of the things that I'm concerned about I do want to say that it has always been thought that Harry was you know exceptionally close with Princess Diana and I'm sure that after living through that and the grief of losing his mother he was concerned that a similar situation might happen to Megan and as a you know a doting husband he wanted to protect her and that is you know wonderful and fine and I respect that but I feel like some situations in here might have been fabricated a little bit uh they've definitely been dramatized we're going to talk about that in just a couple of seconds but basically if you look at this comment section on this trailer nobody is fooled nobody is having a good time really nobody wants to watch this other than to [\u00a0__\u00a0] on it basically somebody said I love the part where Netflix actually had the balls to leave the comments open it is pure gold and you're gonna see this is kind of the format of all of these comments somebody else said I love the part where Harry advises people to quit their jobs if they feel stressed and to rely on their multi-million dollar trust fund instead very relatable here's another one that's a person of color I love the part where she doesn't invite any of her mother's family to the wedding I also love the part where people of color we're excited to see themselves represented in the royal family only to have her leave and burn Bridges behind her thus leaving us with only cheesy podcasts and pathetic shows on Netflix thanks schmeg somebody else said I loved the bar where Megan just wanted so desperately to get away from media attention that she only created a podcast went on Oprah pitched to do voice over work all the main media outlets and made a Netflix documentary somebody else said I love the part where after spending 39 years in the royal family Harry suddenly realizes that there is a hierarchy I mean like literally thousands of comments and they are all gold so obviously the show is getting slammed but it is not just because people don't really like Harry and Megan it is getting slammed because they are using fake content and clips they're fabricating a lot of this this is from BBC they said Harry and Megan's Netflix trailers criticized over misleading Clips here's another one Prince Harry and Meghan Markle accused of Faking press houndings let's just look at this BBC article where they take us through the trailer and they myth bust all of the clips that they used here we go the first one this up with all the paparazzi that's from the Harry Potter Premiere in 2011 before Harry and Megan even met oh yeah all that crazy Paparazzi when they're on the red carpet here's another one this picture this clip of all the paparazzis you know running and chasing somebody they're not chasing Megan they are chasing British model Katie Price who was walking into court to deal with her drunk driving charge and not only did they use this clip from her trial and overlay Megan talking about uh the hardships of being a woman marrying into the royal family no they also flipped the clip horizontally so that they're actually facing the other direction so it wasn't as obvious that they were just making this up number three this picture of all of the reporters and photographers climbing over a car trying to get pictures Megan was not in that car Princess Diana was not even in that car they were trying to get pictures of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen going to prison this was not this is not even in the UK they just grabbed this random clip and then again overlaid another thing of them being like oh so it's a dirty game it was so hard like obviously I'm sure that the UK press was hounding them that is what happens when you were in the royal family you get pictures taken of you every single day and obviously there is a history of them you know overreaching and you know violating their privacy but you're literally lying you're using clips that are not even connected to you whatsoever here's another one the overhead camera shot of Harry walking with their son Archie and Megan this was not some invasion of privacy the photographer is on record saying I was one of three photographers that was invited on this trip to document the trip and document their meeting with this Archbishop this was not an invasion of right they were allowed to be there you know what you're signing up for if you're marrying into the royal family if you are a royal you have spent your entire life getting photos taken of you you know that when you have a baby we saw it with Kate she walks out onto the steps hello I just had to check child four hours ago here's the baby gonna go back in now this is not some shocking news and surprise here we go on this one this clip of all of the Royals standing up there apparently this was cropped to make it look like Megan and Harry were pushed to the sidelines they were actually in the center they just moved the photo over to make it look like they were slighted now obviously I'm sympathetic to the fact that every family has their struggles we all have demons in the closet we have skeletons in the closet but they are making up lies about the royal family they are fabricating all of this in order to make a buck and get a bunch of sympathy from Americans basically and this is not for the UK the UK is already on board with royal family this is for Americans that want to spend all their money championing Meghan Markle and Prince Harry who have come home to basically be like American Royals in a weird sort of way but even though they are getting criticized for all of these lies and using this fake content they are undeterred because this morning actually they landed in New York City thanks to their private jet to accept a humanitarian award they're receiving the Ripple of Hope Award for from the Robert F Kennedy Foundation get this for their heroic stance against structural racism in the royal family so not only are they making millions from Megan's book and her podcast and her press and their docu-series they are also winning humanitarian awards for slandering his family I am so happy for me I deserve this when do you think the Queen's gonna die again I'm sorry if you're upset by me saying that I don't think this is all authentic this is an opportunity for them to make some money they have now been cut off they realize that they would not be able to make a lot of money if they were receding into privacy as they had initially said no they are making money based on Americans being gullible and being interested in royal family drama I literally thought that that heroic thing was a joke do I look like I'm 2x Royals winning humanitarian awards for being whiny babies like this world is a joke thankfully though some people are not having it and are speaking about this publicly especially as it pertains to the humanitarian award like this British television personality and lawyer this was him on Good Morning Britain I believe surely what you would do would be to have the profound and clear and honest humility as a human being to know that there are people out there that you should accept the wart on their behalf bearing in mind the real human rights work that they do now you can feel like feel quite passionate about this right because the idea that I or anybody else here would accept a human rights award you know given what's going on around our globe strikes me as to say the very least and to use the language of that world problematically I mean he truly hit the nail on the head and I love that he threw problematic in there because it really is this whole thing is just ridiculous I mean the fact that we have gotten to a point in society where heroically exposing racism is the epitome of being a humanitarian and fighting for human rights I mean obviously these people try to insert racism into every single possible aspect of Our Lives how has this become the biggest issue in 2022 when like this man said there are things happening around the globe people are literally putting their lives on the line to fight for basic human rights but no this exceptionally Rich ex-royal couple being like my mommy and daddy don't like my new wife that's not you being heroic that's you being a little whiny prick that can't figure out your family problems behind closed doors like the rest of us do thank you very much people are just not fans in general of this whole thing somebody said it's about hatred it's about race it's about time to launch them into space that's actually a better line for their stupid trailer somebody else said the horrors of being a prince and a princess never cease pour one out for Harry and Meg this isn't their first humanitarian award though which is just even more I was about to say revolting but maybe concerning is the right word I don't know they also got one from an organization called population matters for choosing to only have two children in order to save the planet and because of that they won an award for saying a world they're gonna have two kids I mean it they the stupidity is never ending this world is upside down it is a reality TV show nothing is serious that's basically all I can say like you guys remember Harry left the royal family and said that the Press was destroying his mental health he just wanted a normal life with privacy where he could spend time with his wife and they could have children he didn't have to worry about all of this you guys are literally more famous now than you were then immediately after moving to Los Angeles you did multiple stints on James Gordon's late night show you did an Oprah interview Megan's written a book she started a podcast she has been on multiple magazine covers you both were on the cover of time you have accepted humanitarian Awards and now you are releasing the most anticipated Netflix docu-series of the year you are not oppressed at all I don't care what you say and I don't care what those humanitarian Awards make you think you're doing you are not oppressed now last thing I saw this on Twitter and I just had to share it's from one of those like AI software things where you put in a prompt it'll write something for you I know those are really big right now and everybody's doing like the AI face thing I don't know how to do that I don't really know what any of these things are I think this one is called like chat gdt maybe you guys in the comments you can roast me for not doing anything about it I really care I don't want to describe it but this is really funny The Prompt this person wrote was write a strong worded letter to Harry and Megan explaining that their life is not as difficult as they think it is and this is what the AI came up with dear Harry and Megan I'm ready to express my concern about the recent statements you have made about your experiences as members of the royal family while I understand that you may have faced some challenges difficulties in your lives I believe that his support to recognize the privilege and opportunities that you've been afforded as members of the royal family as members of the royal family you have been given the opportunity to live a life of luxury with access to the best Education Health Care and other resources that money can buy you have been able to travel the world meet Fascinating People and participate in important events and ceremonies while it is true that being a member of the royal family comes with its own set of challenges and responsibilities it is also a unique and privileged position that many people would envy I understand that you may feel the need to speak out about your experiences and to raise awareness on certain issues but I would urge you to be mindful of the impact of your words on others many people in the world face much greater challenges and hardships than you do and your savings may come across as self-pitying or ungrateful instead of focusing on your own struggles I would encourage you to use your platform and privilege to raise awareness about the many pressing issues that affect people around the world and use your position to make a positive difference in the world sincerely there I mean the AI said it better than I could have ever done and I actually think the AI made an important point at the end there how is anything they're saying relatable to the common person they're talking about racism in the Royal Family nobody else experiences that maybe a couple of other countries in these you know royal families maybe they're like oh yeah are you really like hitting home for me you're not speaking to the masses here we are just watching this because you are entertainers and it is dramatic and this is like trash TV you are not making some positive difference I mean one could say that you are you know controlling your own narrative now but you're not receding from public life which is what you said you wanted when you left the royal family a couple of years ago and if you wanted the British press off your back maybe you should stop publicly ripping into your family in your country's beloved institutions like that's a thought that might help you out thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this channel turn on your notifications like this video and of course if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper see you next time [Music]", "AZ6wHsIA7-Y": "oh not you calling me a he that is just oh terrible welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper guys I am back with another Dylan Mulvaney story if you are not caught up which I'm assumed all of you are at this time Dylan Mulvaney is Tick tock's very favorite trans girl Dylan is back in the news and this time it is for Feud with another famed trans woman Caitlyn Jenner get spicy very excited we have some Inter-Community fighting but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection this is how it all started we have to kind of backtrack a bit Marcia Blackburn who is a Tennessee senator posted this old video of Dylan where Dylan is talking about private parts and tuckage Marcia Blackburn said Dylan Mulvaney Joe Biden and the radical left-wing lunatics want to make this absurdity normal and then this is Dylan's video 74 being a girl Round of Applause for the makeup and I wore this outfit shopping today and I thought that these might be my new shopping shorts but I was walking around and everyone was staring and I was like oh okay what's going on and they were all staring directly at my crotch and I went oh I forgot that my crotch doesn't look like other women's crotches sometimes because mine doesn't look like a little Barbie pocket and I thought okay Dylan you have some options here I'd have to stop the fact that you've just forgotten that you have a dick what you don't have one of these do you I'm a woman I've been a woman for I don't know how many days now since birth I didn't know that I needed shopping shorts is that a female thing that I have just been unaware of do I need to go buy shopping shorts if so I'm really glad that I have cultivated on my computer to help me get the best deal possible because if you know that over 60 of products on Amazon are sold by third party Sellers and that 50 of those sellers are based in China these foreign sellers don't have to pay taxes or create jobs in the US they just overcharge you for cheap products and that is why I use my new sponsor cultivate cultivate is a completely free browser extension that shows you where product listings on Amazon come from and where you can find cheaper local alternatives for example maybe I'm shopping for shopping shorts and I pull up a pair on Amazon but I see that the seller is from China but then cultivate will show me that I can get it for 20 cheaper at a local store here in Nashville which is incredible I can get this product cheaper I can pick it up on my way home from the studio and I know that I am supporting my local economy since using cultivate I have learned that I can save an average of 30 on things that I would be buying anyway Plus on top of all of that cultivate has this cool Rewards program where the more that you use the browser extension the more money you earn towards donations for a charity of your choice to get started go to wecultivate.us slash Cooper to download cultivate start saving money and supporting your local economy again that's wecultivate.us slash Cooper and that will take you directly to the app downloading page so that we can all get started on getting some shopping shorts so excited to start wearing those around without my bulge anyway number one you clothes that fit like this and and just find looser fitting items number two I can do a talk which is going to have to be a whole other video but it's very painful and involved of a or number three I just normalize it and I wear clothes like this and we all just normalize women having bulges sometimes because we're coming up on bikini season baby and you might see a bulge or two so normalize the Bulge we are normalizing the Bulge women can have bulges and that's okay we're not gonna stare at their crotches while they're wearing their little shopping shorts at the mall God I had forgotten how unfortunate that video is and no we're not going to normalize women having bulges that's not biological that's not real you wear whatever you want Dylan that's totally fine your shorts look cute that's fine women do not have bulges and there's a name for Barbie pouches and you can say it it's fine Caitlyn retweeted the video and said Marcia Blackburn thank you for speaking out and having a backbone one of the best Senators we have let's not normalize any of what this person is doing this is absurdity then New York Post wrote an article about it which Caitlyn also retweeted and this is when things got a bit spicy Caitlyn said there's a difference between acceptance and tolerance and normalizing exposing your genitals in a public way in public place I do not support that at all in the scientist Dylan congrats you are trans with a penis now I don't love this comment because Caitlyn seems to miss the point and is being inflammatory about some of the people really weren't concerned about in the first place because Dylan isn't exposing genitals in any horrific way like I've seen the tight pants that you Caitlyn Jenner wore as a man I have seen them I've seen the tight jeans men are wearing these days I've seen the Lululemon short I have seen the gray sweatpants there is nothing abhorrent or explicit about it the absurdity is the delusions and the mockery of women and calling your ideal crotch a Barbie pocket and wanting to normalize women having bulges that is not objective truth that is weird we don't need to normalize that we can be tolerant and accepting without affirming and normalizing things that go against objective truth and what we might think is unhealthy but that was not the end of it Caitlyn left a now deleted Twitter reply misgendering Dylan Caitlyn said he is talking about his penis it's not the wildest thing in the world we just watched a video where Dylan was saying oh my God my crotch is bulging that means you have a penis so you are a man but apparently Caitlyn did not write this it came from somebody on Caitlyn's social team an apology has been issued Washington examiner put out an article about it and said an individual on Miss Jenner's team haphazardly misgendered Dylan in the Tweet he is talking about his penis for this we deeply regret the comment and have taken the appropriate actions to rectify the situation internally representative for Jenner told the Washington examiner Miss Jenner has no further comment on the matter and stands by her statements otherwise fine I guess people got really angry about that if Caitlyn is one of his gender people that's totally fine uh but we are not finished with the story after all of this Dylan made a response video on Tick Tock here we go we're gonna watch the whole thing it's day 233 of being a girl and this video is for Caitlyn Jenner if you're not Caitlyn keep on scrolling but if you do stay I don't know grab a beverage hi Caitlin I'm Dylan and we are two of the most privileged trans women in America at the moment and with that comes a lot of responsibility and although we have very different views on most things a few days ago I probably would have still been willing to sit down with you and try to connect with you in some way because I automatically have a lot of respect for you as a fellow trans woman but then you decided to ridicule me very publicly and honestly this tweet didn't phase me all that much but then this one made me go oh not you calling me a he that is just oh terrible but then you didn't stop there you said there is a difference between acceptance and tolerance and normalizing exposing your genitals in a public way in a public place I do not support that at all in the slightest Dylan dot dot dot congrats you're trans with the penis girl you're making me sound like I'm some creepy flasher exposing myself I was wearing perfectly normal shorts at a mall and I've never been great with sarcasm but I do think that last line was probably not an actual congrats and in this moment I am not as comfortable talking about my private parts as I was when I made that video and it felt like I got out of it thank you and I didn't fully know how to tuck that early on and I was still wearing men's Calvin Klein underwear but after that video two amazing trans women gifted me tucking panties and taught me how because they could tell I was struggling and I'm just curious if you can think back to your early days of transitioning and remember being embarrassed about your body or having strangers give you dirty looks that's why I made that video because I was embarrassed and I wanted to reclaim my body in a positive way and now you've taken that and you've turned it into something really ugly and I didn't start days of girlhood because being a woman sounded fun I started this series because of the unspoken shame of being newly trans I still have so much to learn okay remember this point guys just had to pause for a second because we are going to hit on this point a little later because I think that this is the main thing that people are concerned about all right anyway we're gonna continue on and we come from very different generations and you're so much farther along in your journey than I am but I have cheered you on from the second you came out truly and I'm so happy that you've had the surgeries that you've desired but I'm 25 years old and I am on day 233 I can't even get bottom surgery right now if I wanted to I haven't been on hormones long enough and this whole situation makes me not want to share my surgical plans because there are so many trans women who don't have access to it or they don't want it and it doesn't make them any less of a woman you know funny enough one of the only things that we do have in common is that I'm going to one of your surgeons you know I'm just I'm not as far along as you please be patient and you know now that I think about it I I don't even think I have interest in getting to know you because I want to believe that this is all genuine but I also have a Dylan as an actor it told me so this also does feel kind of dramaticized and a trans person invalidating another trans person's transness is pretty evil in my eyes like the call is coming from inside the house coming off very selfish you know is no one else allowed to be trans I for one am excited to welcome anyone into our community because I know how isolating it can be in this whole situation it feels like the movie Mean Girls I mean Halloween is right around the corner so there's a costume idea for us I guess I don't know I digress but you've been accepted like you've been accepted by a group of people that clearly does not accept me and nearly every day this week I have been called a freak a child predator an absurdity I am none of those things that your cohorts are painting me to be and my question for you is don't you feel a little lonely over there these people that you're standing with I don't know if they have your best intentions at heart but they they will use you to make me in the trans community life like a lot harder than it already is and I would never tell any of my followers to go shame you for any of this or to misgender you and if you're a follower watching please don't go after Caitlyn because I already know how difficult it is to be publicly trans yet you have personally subjected me to thousands and thousands of hateful eyes a number of which could very well want to hurt me and that's how much power you have you were Woman of the Year this is not Woman of the Year Behavior you know also I I do know it was just your birthday this weekend happy birthday I think everyone should have a pleasant birthday even you you're a Scorpio I'm a Capricorn I guess we're just not compatible um also also if you could if we could just leave your daughters out of this I would be very grateful because I do enjoy them and I would like to meet them one day and lastly also also also no need to respond to this video I am moving on onward and upward and I hope you do too okay bye now guys I have said it before I like Dylan I was watching pre-transition Dylan's tick tocks all throughout covid over the last year or so Dylan seems joyful and positive I still I follow Dylan not just to like get content but because I enjoy some of the videos and this response was was well composed but it also left me feeling like it was very advantageous to Dylan it was all about Dylan and it is a very common leftist tactic where it's like I'm gonna speak my truth I have a problem with this you need to sit down and listen to me but then no need to respond now I actually don't want to sit down and talk with you anymore I don't want to hear about any of this but I would actually like to meet your daughters because that would be very cool that would help me out a lot it all just felt a bit contrived a bit fake and that really is one of my main concerns with Dylan is that everything does feel very fabricated and fake even the way that he just portrays Womanhood but overall I still think the point of this Feud is kind of being missed and granted Caitlyn did not really communicate it very well but the issue isn't about out Dylan being trans Dylan is an adult that's fine do whatever you want what does not find is gender affirming care for kids that was my main concern with the interview with Biden not that Dylan was there having an appearance with Biden but that the two of them were sitting there talking about trans kids saying that they needed to ensure that they could be on puberty blockers and get the gender affirming treatment that they need under the guise of it being care doing irreversible damage to impressionable children's bodies and Minds is not care it is exactly the opposite and that is what we're fighting against that is my line drawn in the sand when you turn 18 years old that's fine do what you want it is your life but when you are a child I will do everything in my power to protect you the other issue that so many people have and that I also have is the mockery and the caricature being made of women and girls and the fact that so many companies and institutions are so desperate to seem Progressive that they are putting Dylan and other trans women in the place of women it's just it's not even that I feel offended and triggered and they're taking a spot from a woman it's just objectively not real it's not biological and it's just strange and that's why I pause in the middle of that video to say hey remember that point because just think about the Forbes Women's Conference we're Dylan was speaking in the Ulta podcast on Womanhood that was hosted by two trans women there was not a biological woman in sight to talk about or think about Tampax a tampon brand wanted to sponsor Dylan who does not have a Barbie pocket it is just ridiculous and I've said it before the way that Dylan represents Womanhood is just not real and it feels like a game and I want to believe that it really is all in good faith I would love that because like I said I enjoyed the videos I enjoy the energy but it feels like a mockery and I don't think it is productive for either the trans Community or for women in general somebody tweeted and said isn't it curious when Dylan Mulvaney decided he was a girl 200 days ago and is already sitting down with the president of the United States Caitlyn Jenner's woman of the year one year into claiming Womanhood it appears that the only thing holding women back was that they weren't born white men yeah apparently think about Leah Thomas and I mean that is just an excellent point while we're on the subject I also think it is ridiculous that Caitlyn was made woman of the year right after transitioning like regardless of whether you're on my side politically it's just weird and again not objective truth now most people online are taking Dylan's side in this his comment section is filled with people celebrating the response and tweeting out you know support somebody said Caitlyn Jenner is a self-loathing hateful transphobe big shocker leave Dylan Mulvaney alone this trans woman supports Dylan also not all trans people have the same Financial Freedom as you Caitlyn for some of us physical transition takes longer don't make us less trans Dylan Mulvaney's response to Caitlyn Jenner was beautiful and heartbreaking trans people can't keep doing this to each other this guy though had a different opinion and had some thoughts he said Dylan Mulvaney is arguing with Caitlyn Jenner about public tucking protocols Caitlyn won a gold medal and makes a more convincing argument Mr of Mulvaney is misogynist in a dress his entire image is a caricature of what an unintelligent man believes bimbo women act like I mean that last line very accurate very spot-on connects back to what we were saying just two minutes earlier and of course I don't hate Dylan Dylan is an adult you can be trans if you want you can entertain people on Tick Tock or like the videos it's fine but every video that I've made about this situation when I've talked about Dylan it all comes back to the character of Womanhood that is what I find concerning and that is what I find utterly ridiculous I'm sure that it is going to continue going on this train is not stopping anytime soon I think that this might wrap up the viewed for now because Caitlyn Jenner was told not to respond but we'll see what happens of course I'll keep you updated I'm sure there will be more videos thank you for

johnny depp it was a really wonderful time i think it'll go down in the history books but you know it has been a bit quiet since then so in classic true amber heard narcissist fashion she's back and

comment section episode because you never know we might have more amber heard content forever she might never give up because she is the narcissist as i said amber heard sat down for a 10 minute long tell all peace with savannah guthrie from the today show and it was as ridiculous as you might expect i don't know i can imagine quite a bit but i will say guthrie was a classy interviewer she asked the hard questions she pushed one was appropriate she was respectful it was clear that she was not like an amber heard simp by any means which made it better in my opinion but she was respectful and she was kind which is you know kind of all that you can ask for in that weird situation we're going to watch the whole thing because there are some nuggets of gold in here but a little context the today show posted clips from the interview and then posted the entire thing all of them are deleted now they got ratioed so hard people were so pissed at them that the only way that you could find it online now is if you watch the entire today show episode and then you have to like move forward to find her little segment so i had my team pull it we're going to watch it here but just know they literally wiped this from the internet because people were so angry at it so that's how you know it's going to be good like literally nobody actually believes any of her bs and it kind of is a beautiful moment online because regardless of political affiliation or whatever people have come together in their hatred of amber heard and it's kind of you know the internet beef of the year in my mind it's everybody against amber heard and you know you know me i love internet beef so i'm a fan of it but you know what i do love more than internet beef is good ranchers beef and this is the

difficult in part yes um this has been a long time coming i just have to say as an actor almost every actor kind of has their tics i think i blink in a weird way it's just one of my things but with her when she's like really acting it kind of looks like her nose is stinging she goes i don't i can't even do it right you notice that right it's like it's like i can i don't even know it's but it's it's like this like pained like oh i'm gonna look sad anyway just watch for it you're gonna see it she also does this little like breath like thing that she does it's basically like when you're watching biden do a speech and he does is like that those are her tics so for this interview watch out for that okay back into it to my dying day will stand by every word of my testimony the real-life drama of the defamation case between amber heard and her ex-husband johnny depp captivated millions of people around the world amber just got exposed johnny you hit me this is so cringe with clips spreading across social media like wildfire i think vast majority of this trial was played out on social media i think that this trial is an example of that gone haywire gone amok and the jury is not immune to that do you think the jury saw it how could they not i think even the most well-intentioned juror it would have been impossible to avoid this people online and crowds outside the courthouse made it clear where they stood every single day i passed for three four sometimes six blocks city blocks lined with people holding signs saying burn the witch death to amber after three and a half weeks i took the stand and saw just a courtroom packed full of captain jack sparrow fans who are vocal energized can you put into words how that felt this was the most humiliating and horrible thing i've ever been through to put it lightly i think that's you feeling the consequences of your actions feeling the consequences of lying and being exposed when you make a mistake and that's like aired out to the world it's not pleasant so i think you're feeling normal feelings and i'm sorry that you're a celebrity that was all aired out all over the internet but you asked for it let's go back to the day of the verdict were you feeling confident that's a great question i wish i could say yes to that i want to say yes to you but it would wouldn't be true literally every word that comes out of her mouth reads like a monologue from the freaking titanic i'll never let go i promise am i wrong no like she has scripted all of this i wonder if this is a scripted interview you still couldn't tell me look me in the eye and tell me that you think on social media there's been a fair representation do you find that mr depp has proven all the elements of defamation answer yes after the six-week trial the jury found her defamed depp in a 2018 washington post op-ed in which she wrote she was a public figure representing domestic abuse she never mentioned her ex-husband by name depp denied the abuse allegations in court heard won just one of three claims in her countersuit against her ex-husband that verdict came less than two years after a judge ruled against stepp in a similar case in the uk in which he sued a british newspaper that called him a wife beater there was another trial handled with the same dealt with the same substantive issues that had even more evidence in in fact mine my evidence was largely kept out really important pieces of evidence kept out done differently handled differently by a judge instead of a jury some evidence is admissible in a uk court that is not admissible in a u.s court do you think that maybe he just had better lawyers i will say his his lawyers did a certainly a better job of distracting the jury from the real issues for some people they just would frankly disgusted by the whole thing and don't have much sympathy for either one of you can you understand that absolutely i would not blame the average person for looking at this and how it's been covered and not think that it is hollywood brats that they're at their worst but what people don't understand is it's it's actually so much bigger than that this is uh this is not only about our first amendment right to speak first of all yes i can agree with her on one thing and that is that there were a lot of people saying that you know this is hollywood elite drama why would i care about it is bigger than just hollywood elite drama because it is basically the crumbling of the metoo movement at the hands of amber heard even though she would not like to admit it and she won't say that and this is not about your first amendment rights you have the right to say all of that about johnny depp but you also you know are not protected from being held accountable which i hope is what savannah guthrie is about to say the first amendment protects free speech it doesn't protect lies that amount to defamation and that was the issue in the case yes exactly you can't go into the free speech does not protect you if you you know go into a crowded theater and you scream fire we get the concept of free speech from the greeks my understanding of what that means is not just the freedom to speak it's a freedom to speak truth to power but truth is the word yes and that was the issue and that's all i spoke and i spoke it to power and i paid the price in the closing arguments the depth lawyer said god called your testimony the performance of a lifetime and said you were acting what do you say to that says the lawyer for the man who convinced the world he had scissors for fingers okay guys i saw this clip on twitter and i swear i thought that it was doctored so i do have the comments briefly i'm gonna i'm gonna move from this for a moment because i do have the comments from this original clip that i saw that i genuinely thought was edited but somebody said wait till she finds out she isn't entitled to half of the chocolate factory and somebody said she left most of the chocolate factory on the bed someone says a weirder thing is that the legal team managed to convince the whole court in the world that his name is johnny and not edward if i ever end up in legal trouble i'm hiring his team damn they're good somebody else said i'll never forget the disappointment and anger i felt after we were all told that edward scissorhands wasn't a biopic never really forgiven debt for that i had listened to weeks of testimony uh insinuating that or saying quite directly that you know i'm a terrible actress so i i i'm i'm a bit confused how i could be both the depth team argued that you were the abuser that you instigated physical violence did you i never had to instigate it i responded to it when you're living in violence and it becomes becomes normal as i testify to you have to adapt you say you were responding but there is evidence there are tapes in which you acknowledge hitting there are tapes in which you say i started the fight i know much has been made of of these audio tapes they were first leaked online after being edited what you would hear in those clips are not evidence of what was happening it was evidence of a negotiation of how to talk about that with your abuser but i am looking at a transcript that says he says you start physical fights and you say i did start a physical fight i can't promise you i won't get physical again i mean this is in black and white i understand context but you're testifying and you're just telling me today i never started a physical fight and here you are on tape saying you did savannah got three like mad props to her because she's not backing down and amber is literally she is so uncomfortable that's great but she brought the receipts and i'm here for it when your life is at risk not only will you take the blame for things that you shouldn't take the blame for but when you're in an abusive dynamic psychologically emotionally and physically you don't have the resources that say you or i do with the luxury of saying hey this is black and white because it's anything but when you're living in it but then there are other times there's another tape where you're taunting him and saying oh tell the world johnny depp i a man i'm a victim of domestic violence 20 second clips or the transcripts of them are not representative of even the two hours or the three hours that those clips are excerpt from could your side have just put the whole three hours in then i'm not a lawyer as i testified to i was talking in those recordings as a person an extreme amount of emotional psychological and physical distress he says doesn't never hit you he can never is that a lie yes it is what about the witnesses who said they have seen you instigate physical violence i've seen firsthand how people will file rank and support the person they depend on did they all come in and lie in court i am not here to call any of these witnesses any names i'm here to just kind of talk about it from what it felt like for me as a person who sat there when i asked his lawyers why do you think you won and the answer i got was because she never took responsibility for anything she did in the marriage i did do and say horrible regrettable things throughout my relationship i behaved in horrible almost unrecognizable to myself ways there's so much i have so much regret i freely and openly and voluntarily talked about what i did i talked about the horrible language i talked about being pushed to the extent where i didn't even know the difference between you know um right and wrong i will always continue to feel like i was a part of this like i was the other half of this relationship because i was and it was ugly and could be very beautiful it was very very toxic we were awful to each other what is it are you a tortured artist that wants to be in some chaotic relationship or are you an actual victim or are you just a narcissistic liar that's what you are really you're just a narcissistic liar i was looking at some of the comments on the longer form video that is still up where you have to like go through and hunt for all of the clips and i just love it because people are so fed up with her somebody says she has never made a real apology in her life i think she only apologized when it is to manipulate the situation for her benefit she doesn't see that the best thing she could do right now is just apologize and admit that she was wrong but she can't because that would prove that she lied in court somebody else said she was fine with johnny's reputation being ruined by her false accusations but now that the truth is out there and the tide is turned against her suddenly it's unfair oh amber welcome to the consequences of your actions exactly i mean she is a classic narcissist and i don't want to just throw that word around but i deal with narcissists in my family clinical narcissists on paper this is exactly what they do they shift the blame they never never take responsibility they evade everything it is all about preserving their good as gold godly basically image to the world no matter what they will allow everybody else to take the fall so that they can somehow still rise above now everybody usually sees through their bs but in their mind they're still protecting their image it's exactly what she was doing so when dr curry during the trial you diagnosed her with all of that you know bipolar multiple personality whatever narcissistic stuff i think she was pretty spot on now one of the clips that was taken down by the today show was at the end amber was saying like we can't really trust johnny's witnesses because they were a bunch of people who worked for him and there were all of these randos at the end rando meaning kate moss like speaking of narcissist you think kate moss is a rando are you somehow better than kate moss no somebody tweeted and said amber heard i heard that johnny depp pushed kate moss down the stairs kate moss that never happened amber heard what's with all these randos why'd you testify somebody else said literally everyone every single person who defends amber heard has the replies closed this should tell you everything yes including amber herself the only people that can reply to her are amber heard fan accounts literally go look at her statement after the trial it's kind of hysterical it's all like amber her daily amber heard fans it's ridiculous someone else said o.j simpson if i did it amber heard if i was lying birds of a feather yeah you're not wrong now the last part of the story is that amber might have been cut from aquaman too not totally sure just jared which is you know hollywood whatever news source posted this exclusive and said amber heard cut from aquaman 2 will be recast and then they did an update and they say sources close to the aquaman production have showed us an update saying amber has not been completely cut from the film she still has a small role our other sources say that amber will be recast but we'll update our readers as more information rolls in amber's reps and amber herself said no this is a lie so we really have no idea but at this point in her story i really don't know if there's any coming back from that and like on principle i am against people getting canceled i don't believe that your entire life and career should be blown up because you dissent from you know mainstream norms and narratives or whatever but this woman is a liar and she deserves the consequences of her actions when you step over the line when you abuse a court of law you're going to have to face the consequences and if those consequences are you losing a job losing money i'm kind of okay with that like she ripped johnny depp to shreds over false accusations and is now frantically trying to save herself and i have no patience for it this is not cancer culture this is karma amber so get ready for it hey hey i can't believe you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "eyKhkSvwL0Y": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper there was a Women's Conference that happened over the weekend I had no idea that was going on but I really don't pay attention to those things anymore there was actually a period in high school where I was very involved with a few different women's organizations I did some stuff with vital voices and then the parent company of Ann Taylor and Loft they did a lot of women's work and I was you know like a representative of bears I traveled around like speaking on panels with young women like I was very invested in that world but I've kind of come out of it because so many of those people are toxic angry feminists so I don't really get along with them anymore but those conferences are still going on and Forbes held one over the weekend it was called the Forbes power Women's Summit when I first saw it I thought it might be about power lifting but apparently it's just a general Women's Conference and at this Summit trans activist and Tick-Tock star Dylan Mulvaney was one of the featured speakers at the women's conference so we're going to talk about that in the internet's reaction but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection so this is the tweet that first got everybody's attention and got ratioed to high heaven thankfully but Forbes women tweeted this out on September 16th and they said Dylan Mulvaney speaks about collaboration and authorship at the Forbes power Women's Summit this is the quote there's Dylan right there in some kind of little Tweed bralette thingamajigger but Dylan says there's also a level of trust that needs to come from an older generation to say we respect you enough to take the reins on this we're gonna get into that quote momentarily because I don't know why you are taking the reins from women I think that the older generation of real women has the right to hold on to those Reigns to keep them from a man because there seemed to be a lot of men that are taking the reins these days but anyway I digress if you do not know who Dylan is here you go because you kind of need to have some contacts before we get into this day 66 being a girl and today I'm in nature trees I love them water lakes I love them heels they're my hiking heels I love them Bridges love them coconut water love it not mad just love it wind turbine love it Meadows love them [Music] love ya oh Dear God there's so much to say about that and I have no energy for it because this person is literally ridiculous oh brother this guy stinks here's another one we just I have to show you one more [Music] [Music] like I'm sorry this just screams quirky pick me girl and it's not even a real girl is this hard to watch it's like Dylan has seen caricatures of women in movies and TV shows and social media and is deciding oh that's gonna be me like dude no that that is not what a real woman does you can't just put on a dress and claim dear woman I say that a lot but it's the most simple and true fact Dylan Mulvaney came out as Trans on Tick Tock in March of 2022 this year and has been tracking their transition since then and did this whole series of 100 days of girlhood and would go okay day one of being a girl day two and would track the different things that they were doing buying new dresses going to hormone therapy whatever Dylan seems like a very nice and joyful person I know that Dylan does you know comedy videos and all of these things they're supposed to be you know kind of Taken ingest but Dylan is not a woman Dylan is playing a caricature of a woman because as we all know Womanhood has apparently just been reduced to a game of dress-up which apparently Forbes also agrees with because Dylan was chosen as their featured speaker in a women's Summit here is something that Dylan posted as they were getting prepped for the event you can see them in the same little outfit of being a woman it's day 188 of being a woman that's right I said woman because I'm about to go speak at the Forbes power Women's Summit I still get so much criticism for calling myself a girl and not a woman and even though I already addressed that in earlier videos but I just became so obsessed with Beyonce's new album Renaissance and the first song is literally called I'm that girl so Beyonce can call herself a girl so can I and the point is moot I wore pants which is a rare occasion because I do tend to get misgendered when I wear them but I don't think that's gonna happen today I'm feeling very sexy um and at the summit today I'm speaking with my friend Barbie Ferreira about the social media to mainstream industry Pipeline and I'm just honored to be in the room with these ladies let alone speak but the fact that I am just shows that we're heading in the right direction power posing with Barbie before we speak and the craziest part is now all of these things are happening that I didn't even know were dreaming what are we there how did you feel I felt amazing I think it went really well so basically that was the event that was Dylan's whole summary of it and everybody on Tick Tock loves Dylan Like Dylan basically has no haters on the platform everybody is super pro his transition all of that stuff and it is true that Dylan did get a bunch of criticism when he was calling himself a girl not a woman because all of his fans were saying like no like do Womanhood all of this stuff but Dylan's rationality for calling him they herself girl is that he is just entering into Womanhood and so he doesn't feel like a fully formed woman yet get harder so he just wants to call himself a girl which I guess I sort of agree with because you were not a woman but you're still also not a girl so that's basically what he was saying in that part of the video but like I said everybody on Tick Tock loves Dylan and loves Forbes decision to have Dylan as a featured speaker but on Twitter not so much people like I said ratioed this Forbes post somebody said when did the women speak probably never another person said I think you've asked a bloke to speak on behalf of women there hope this helps another person said you are promoting this person in their mid-30s who relentlessly goes on about their girlhood Journey who calls vaginas Barbie pouches and reduces Womanhood to harmful stereotypes what message does this send women and girls yes all of that is true the entire way that Dylan acts is basically the embodiment of the stereotypes that men think about women the girliness the silliness the pick me ask they're like I'm so funny he like that's not actually how we act in real life we are much more complex than that even though apparently people do not want to believe that and on top of all of that and everything this comment was saying it's important to remember that Dylan was literally offered a sponsorship with Tampax the tampon brand even though Dylan does not have a Barbie pouch to put a tampon in so clearly it's not just Forbes like all of these woke companies are leaning in and affirming and supporting this utter delusion but thankfully though Jeremy's Racers is not these days it feels like every company hates you and is trying to Gaslight you into believing that men are women and that masculinity is literally death to all but not Jeremy's Racers Jeremy wants to remind you what being a real man is all about which is having an amazing shave and driving a badass car which is why he is giving you the opportunity to win his McLaren spider and if you want to see the car in action we filmed a super sick video of me driving it it is on my channel the link will be in the description but if you want to try and win the car go to Jeremy's racers.com play to get your unique referral link when somebody uses your link to buy a Jeremy's razor shave kit they get a whole 12 off you get store credit for new upcoming Jeremy's products and you both get points in the race to win the McLaren you also get points if your friends join daily wire plus one of you will win the car and the rest of you won't which is you know sad but everybody wins because you will have rescued a bunch of your friends from shopping from woke virtue signaling companies that insist men are toxic and that men can apparently be women like Tampax and you know as ridiculous as the Tampax thing is I mean it's genuinely mind-boggling to Dylan's credit he did turn down the Tampax sponsorship because he realized this is ridiculous I do not have a Barbie pouch but then again Dylan is still sitting on stage speaking on behalf of women as a fake woman so apparently the self-awareness here just comes in waves I don't know somebody else replied and said what a shame you couldn't find a woman to talk oh that's doubtful they're probably more trans than real women these days to be quite honest another person said in six months Dylan has learned enough about being a woman so much more than actual women that Forbes has invited Dylan to come and speak to women about being women the [\u00a0__\u00a0] piss take of it all I mean yes I'm not really somebody that gets offended by things but it is just absurd and objectively kind of offensive that somebody gets to sit on stage and preach to me about Womanhood when they have never experienced one single day of it I don't care that you've had six months of being a girl you still haven't experienced real Womanhood you never will I want to wrap it up with these comments because this kind of sums up how I feel somebody said I don't think Dylan's videos are made with Mal intent they're lighthearted and playful albeit absurd this can't be serious I don't get a bad feeling from Dylan but it is still offensive that they spoke at the Women's Summit to end to play stereotypes regardless I wish Dylan well somebody replied and said I also think Dylan isn't a bad person but the fact that he is coming out as a woman or girl for less than a year doesn't make him a woman right away ever you can say ever it's not offensive there are so many successful authentic women you could have just said biological women women working so hard for many years that deserve the same opportunity yes like nothing Dylan is doing is helping women or advancing true Womanhood same for Forbes but of course Dylan is still an adult and seems like a genuinely nice person Dylan can go do whatever he wants I would just urge Dylan to have a little more self-awareness you do not become a woman by simply putting on a dress we are so much more than that and I can't believe that I have to explain that and I get the Dylan is trying to learn and understand that in his you know days of girlhood Journey but until you've lived it biologically and walked a hundred miles on our shoes you will not get it you never will so do not sit up on stage and preach to us nobody wants to hear that guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "YWusAPXy04c": "oh my gosh did you hear that pete and kim broke up huh p davidson and kimberly kardashian oh no they're they're kathleen oh jesus whoa is them oh no kate and pam welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper now this happened on friday when i was already home and so i wanted to do it monday but i was out so now tuesday guys i am finally talking about the breakup of the summer kim and pete i am dead inside now if you are new here which is kind of ironic to say because the show's only been around for four months but if you are relatively new to the common section family there's something you should know and that that is i love talking about pete davidson crushing it i don't like pete davidson i don't think that he is particularly funny i just think he gets himself into situations that are highly entertaining and chaotic and i also think he looks like a wet cigarette so as a result i enjoy diving into his life so we're back with another part of the pete davidson saga and that is that after nine whole deep beautiful months uh kim kardashian and pete have officially called it quits the first tweet that i saw when i was going through the trending page and looking at all the replies uh was this girl saying how do i make the breakup of pete and kim k about me well i know how to make it about me and that is by turning it into content that hopefully you guys all like and you guys know the drill make sure that you subscribe to this channel if you are not already and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode and if you are wanting even more content from me you can follow me on instagram at i'm brett cooper because we are seriously growing so fast on all of these platforms it is absolutely insane and i'm just so grateful because i get to sit around and talk about wet cigarette pete davidson and you all get to enjoy it and we get to talk about it in the comments and it's literally just the greatest thing ever the internet took this and ran with it i mean meanwhile the world is literally falling apart but kim k will never cease to make headlines somebody said oh i'm so sorry to hear about the breakup of pete davidson and kim but hey at least he started dressing a little nicer and has a hilarious tattoo to remind him of what a terrible idea that whole thing was we're gonna talk about that in a second but that was a benefit he started to look a little less like a wet cigarette over the course of these nine months somebody else posted pete davidson spotted with the queen of england after his recent breakup with kim kardashian if you know pete you kind of know that he has a track record of you know dating women that are at least 10 years older than him somebody else said pete davidson after realizing he got kim kardashian and their kids initials tattooed on his body for no reason listen he did not even just get kim's name and her kid's name tattooed and i can't believe that i'm saying that that's like not terrible but he literally got a branding for her you idiot did you ever think it was gonna last with kim kardashian the only thing that should be branded in my life is my good rancher's steak now good ranchers as you all know is my very very favorite meat subscription service and this month in august they are going to be donating 100 000 meals to children in need as they are getting ready to go back to school now to help them out with their mission 10

supporting an amazing american-made company you are helping children in need and we get to have a good time together so honestly this is a win-win situation for all of us somebody posted i get why on a cultural level newspapers are tweeting about the pete davidson kim kardashian breakup but they don't have to like write a whole article we get it listen i want all of the content that i can get have i read every daily mail in page six article detailing this yes i have and am i going to do an entire segment about it yes i am thank you so much josh so obviously you have to remember the whole kim pete kanye saga that was going on for basically the first half of their relationship kim and kanye were in the middle of their divorce she started dating pete kanye hates pete he wants him back all of that that's basically your 15 second debrief but if you are like me and you were very very invested in that then this is probably how you were waiting around on the internet this weekend is me waiting for kanye to post about kevin pete's breakup literally and then the kanye gods offered us something he posted this on his instagram he has no other posts nothing he's deleted everything and he just posts this with no caption it is a new york times uh front page that he has edited to say skeet davidson that's what he calls pete dead at age 28. i mean i don't even have anything to really say about this other than it's absolutely idiotic and i am 100 eating it up all the comments were people going like okay kanye all right like you've been doing well you've been quiet for a bit we really need to bring this back and in my mind i'm like yes let's bring back the drama like you guys remember his music video where he had a claymation decapitated pete davidson i'm not trying to encourage violence i just enjoyed being along for the ride of all of it um somebody else posted this kanye at sunday service this weekend after the kim and pete break up thank you jesus thank you so much [Music] i mean listen say what you will about kanye but the man loves kim and he is a committed father he wants to be there for his children he wants to be involved he wants to have that traditional very healthy nuclear family where he is involved and he's going to do anything to make it happen so now that pete is out of the picture i would not be surprised if we start seeing him you know show up again in his truck with you know 300 roses for kim trying to get back into her life like the man is crazy but he loves her and he's going to do anything he can to make that happen now there are some publicized reasons that kim and pete broke up even though just the pairing in itself was absolutely weird and i think that it was just kim's post-kanye rebound but according to the page six insider that broke the story before their teams confirmed it this is why they broke up quote pete is 28 and kim is 41 they are just in very different places at the moment oh you don't say really they go on to say pete is totally spontaneous and impulsive and wants her to fly to new york or wherever he is on a moment's notice but kim has four kids and it isn't that easy she needs to focus on the kids the source also said that kim runs multiple businesses starts on reality show she is also trying to pass the bar exam she is totally exhausted by this relationship and other things going on in her life again is that surprising you have kim kardashian that whether you love her or you hate her she is an absolute badass businesswoman who is creating this you know kris jenner 2.0 empire and then you have pete davidson in his mom's basement smoking weed post snl doing whatever the heck pete davidson does so all in all the relationship never really lined up from the start so as a result these reasons for the breakup it makes sense and i'm not too surprised about it but people on the internet who are even deeper into the kardashian world and drama than i am had some other thoughts now khloe kardashian kim's sister has been with tristan thompson for years they have a four-year-old together he has cheated on her so many times they've broken up gotten back together he's really just a scumbag of a man but for some reason she decided to get back together with him and have a baby via surrogate which really takes a lot of effort that's not just like a mistake that happens it's very intentional so anyway she decides to have a baby via surrogate nine months ago and guys this baby was born at the end of last week and the news about kim and pete's breakup was dropped on the same day that that baby was born and as a result everybody talked about kim and pete and kanye and did not talk about the fact that khloe kardashian now has another child with cheating scumbag tristan thompson some people jumped on that and somebody said convenient that kim and pete dated for nine months and broke up today also on the day that chloe and trashcan thompson announced that their baby had been born the devil works hard but kris jenner works harder uh and then people were posting memes like this kris jenner uploading kim and pete's breakup announcement so everybody forgets about chloe and tristan's new baby another person tweeted not kim and pete together for exactly nine months and announced breaking up the day that the baby is born with a classic christian picture there are also rumors that pete proposed and kim turned him down unsurprising because she is a boss and he is a wet cigarette i also sort of believe those rumors because he proposed ariana grande after literally a month so i think the man is just like handing out tattoos and rings really it all is just a distraction from bigger issues and i am guilty of feeding into it it's a distraction from you know chloe and tristan's whatever the hell is going on it's a distraction from you know the rest of the world falling apart but in a way i don't feel bad about spending 10 minutes talking about this because the world is a pretty heavy place right now i think if you have any kind of common sense you are worried about the future that we are going to be leaving our children we're worried about the state of the world just in general and in order to survive in that kind of climate you have to enjoy the little things you have to find things to laugh about you have to look at the juicy details of some celebrities life

to come join their football team and then rescinded that offer after a controversial video was posted here's the wraps caption they said University of Florida pulled a scholarship offer from quarterback commit Marcus Stokes after a video of the prospect using the n-word surfaced on Friday last Sunday the Florida Gators football team coach Bill Napier rescinded the offer to four-star quarterback Marcus Stokes following a controversial video that came out with him rapping along and not censoring himself Stokes issued an apology after the fact saying that he deeply regrets the decision do you all think that this was the right move alright so here is this horrifying racist controversial video prepare to be offended two seconds he says it once in this video this is a small clip I seriously do not get it this is a Snapchat video that was obviously sent privately he is in his car rapping along to a song you can tell that this was sent privately because somebody is filming another phone playing it and then people posted it online trying to get him kicked off of this football team like this kid got the rug pulled out from under him and his entire reputation destroyed for

like this this feels like some targeted attack on this poor kid who literally did nothing in my opinion and his reputation has been destroyed because of a two second clip in a private Snapchat video like are you kidding me that is the world we live in it is it never ceases to amaze me somebody tweeted about it and said what young people never purchase any music that mentions the n-word it could destroy your life just ask ex you a Florida football player Marcus Stokes his crime was singing along to a rap song the race agitators don't want your apology they want your head on a platter facts are facts pretty damn accurate to be honest somebody else said dear white athletes don't sing rap songs it will not benefit you at all the mob will destroy you yes they absolutely will now here is his apology statement after the offer was rescinded he says I was in my car listening to rap music rapping along to the words and posted a video of it on social media I deeply apologize for the words in the song that I chose to say it was hurtful and offensive to many people and I regret that I fully accept the consequences for my actions and I respect the University of Florida's decision to withdraw my scholarship offered to play football my intention was never to hurt anyone and I recognize that even when going along with a song My Words still carry a lot of weight I will strive to be better and to become the best version of myself both on and off the field I know that learning from my mistakes is a first important step Marcus Stokes I I hate the fact that he even felt the need to write to that apology it is so absurd kids do weird stupid crap every day this wasn't even that stupid he was privately in his car making a stupid video and his future has literally been ripped apart and now he's feeling the need to do a public apology everybody in the comments is like thank you for your support a learning begins with you shut up there are people posting videos like maybe you could watch this anti-racist video pipe down this is not 20 20 anymore but overall on a broad scale across social media people are taking his side like somebody tweeted out and said I feel bad for that Marcus Stokes kid yes he made a huge mistake saying what he said take his scholarship away though why don't we cancel any comedian that makes a white Jewish black or Asian joke then just find the consequences a tad bit strange absolutely it is never consistent ever I don't agree that it was a huge mistake I think that that person just threw it in to get some brownie points because it's a bit absurd but the rest of it yes somebody else replied and said I want to know how this would have been handled if he was a black quarterback there would have been nothing to handle there would have been literally no situation at all that's how it would have been handled somebody responded to Marcus's statement and said as a black college football fan I really respect your maturity in taking responsibility for your mistake but pulling your scholarship is too much you're young and University of Florida went too far here keep growing Marcus Stokes and good luck in all your future endeavors somebody else replied to a statement and said as a black professional graduate of UF if this action results in taking a scholarship that I have a few professors who I'd like to recommend lose their jobs this is atrocious good luck bro SMH this is sad and a sad day for UF comments on Instagram we're similar in sentiment under the wraps post they said okay we pushing it guys he didn't do anything malicious somebody else said geez how far have we gotten that a song ruined his future people are oversensitive nowadays bro got expelled for something I do every day thousands of times this one really cracked me up apologies in advance that is a bit of a rambler but he said that's actually [\u00a0__\u00a0] up everyone and they mama are such snowflakes getting upset over anything it's not like he was using it in an offensive way it was in a song and if you say you've never said it before you're lying let that man get the offer and stop getting upset over little things like a word snaps based mic drop yes the whole thing is just utterly ridiculous and it seems like a desperate attempt to Virtue signal from UF being like look at us we're so Progressive everybody come to our school we're so anti-racist again shut up I saw a couple of comments from people saying that this wasn't the real reason that he lost his scholarship and it was because they recruited another quarterback so they didn't need him and wanted him out but then people brought up uf's track record this year and how they legit just lost 2 Vanderbilt which if you're in the SEC and you lose to Vanderbilt that is a very very bad sign for you so I don't think that is the reason why he lost it because they need as many good players as possible This truly is political and them trying to make a political statement but don't take it out on a stupid 19 year old kid who was just singing along in his car he did nothing wrong get over it thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just

see you next time [Music]", "6nTSh9TR4H0": "a fan posted this picture of her on the red carpet and it was a really sweet message and twitter went wild and people were honestly being awful to her because of her looks in this photo and so the girl says emma watson just said she wanted the same phone case as me oh my god ah and people honed in on this picture on the right and they're just ripping into her like one person says like time flies emma watson turns 46 today somebody else says emma watson 31 looking older than jk rowling 56 somebody else says feminism before and after i don't agree with her politics i like her as an actress i love harry potter but i mean we can talk about the toxicity of you know of leftism and progressive feminism without ripping into a woman's physical appearance and honestly during other parts of the night she looks stunning per usual like she's gorgeous we can't deny that", "cNVySTFJ30k": "what's up guys welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper so this weekend everybody's favorite insufferable journalist taylor lorenz published a piece with washington post where she is a technology writer effectively doxing the anonymous creator of libs of tick tock which is the twitter page that reposts videos and pictures and tweets from unhinged leftists i mean i get a ton of my content from them it's fantastic literally all this creator does is repost and put a quippy caption about how stupid the people are the left side of the world thinks that lives of tick-tock is literally violent and the account gets reported daily and people have relentlessly tried to figure out who is behind it taylor lorenz cracked the code uh she posted this lives of tik tok has become a powerful force online shaping right-wing media impacting anti-lgbtq plus legislation and influencing millions by posting viral videos aimed at inciting outrage i wrote about the account the woman behind it and why it matters profound so it immediately gets juicy because taylor lorenz did not just write a hit piece about the account she doxed the woman if you don't know doxxing is where you leak a person's address and personal information so that people can basically go hunt them down and it happens to conservatives all the time especially on conservatives it's awful now the woman who runs lips of tick tock is a real estate agent that is what we learned in this article and taylor put a hyperlink in the article that took people directly to the woman's real estate license which had her address her phone number her email address and more she was doxxed now once people started attacking washington post and the article got more traction wapo went into the article and removed the hyperlink they're just trying to cover their asses tim poole immediately jumped in right at the start and said is your position on doxing changed because here's the thing literally two weeks ago taylor lorenz went viral for this clip where she was crying about being docs and being harassed online you feel like any little piece of information that gets out on you will be used by the worst people on the internet to destroy your life and it's so isolating and terrifying it's horrifying i'm so sorry it's fine it's overwhelming it's really hard those are the fakest tears i've ever seen [Music] it's the worst performance i've ever seen the woman is such a sham lymph tick tock took a screenshot from the video as all of this is going on and said i doxed a private citizen in her extended family and people are being mean to me online yeah it's a taste of your own medicine lady taste of your medicine doctor it is so terrible of a thing that i absolutely must inflict it on others it's my favorite high school actors are everywhere now that's kind of what it looked like honestly after the doxing libs of tick-tock had a fire under her ass obviously and she started firing off tweets about taylor it's horrifying and suddenly all of twitter was lives of tick tock versus taylor lorenz and it honestly might be the twitter beef of the year and y'all know that there is nothing that i love more than twitter beef except maybe beef from good ranchers which is my favorite meat subscription company they are grass-fed all-american and an incredible sponsor of the show and honestly just all-around fantastic people if you'd like to try them out go to goodranchers.com and use code cooper for 30 off once you lock in your subscription the price never changes so biden and inflation be damned anyway go check them out back to the online beef taylor lorenz continued to be dragged i mean look at this old tweet if your segment or story on online harassment leads to even worse online harassment for your subjects you up royally and should learn how to cover these things properly before ever talking about them again taylor that's literally what you did libs of tick tock is facing death threats her family is being followed she is literally in hiding right now that is on your hands my friend kyle posted another one i know you're joking but doxing stalking and trying to hurt and smear people's loved ones threatening them it's not okay in any situation people on here who constantly stoke these politicized outrage campaigns want to dismiss it but it shouldn't be dismissed has very real consequences i mean this woman is an idiot does she not unders like sh this is sociopath behavior like she posts all of this stuff online cries about this happening to her and then turns around and does it to somebody else because she disagrees with their opinions it's horrifying but we're not even halfway done i have a second video of lorenz even more hypocritical it's gross let's watch this and online online harassment is such a such a it's just a misnomer i think it's a huge problem because um you know harassment is is a is it's a tool to silence people especially women and people of color or people from marginalized um identities for speaking out and it there's a very intentional like goal behind it it's it's obviously it's death threats and all of that and rape threats on the daily and it's not just twitter it's like every single surface right like you know my cell phone number getting out there people calling people harassing my family members stalking me like all of that is incredibly terrifying and invasive um and it's bled out into the physical world too which is even more terrifying right but to me i think what what especially the media needs to understand about this in terms of protecting their own reporters is this is just a tool like harassment is a tool to kind of discredit and silence journalists and the right-wing media plays along with it okay so she's saying that doxing releasing the phone number stalking family members it's harassment it's triggering it's traumatizing yes obviously it is those things are horrifying she's complaining that it's a tool to silence women to hurt women taylor you literally just hurt the female creator of lips of tick tock you are silencing a woman it's not very progressive feminist of you to be quite honest someone said why is taylor loren so keen to shut down the voices of lgbtqia plus people online that's the real question here yeah because all lives of dick dog does is post public videos from mostly lgbtq plus or lefty people politicians weird professors she's just amplifying their voices somebody else says apparently they don't teach self-awareness in journalism school either okay last one this is the last last taylor video a bunch of people are asking if i'm going to write about the west hem caleb story no i'm on book leave i can't keep writing pieces for the new york times i literally do have a lot of deadlines but journalists who are writing about it please speak to people with experience in online harassment i'm not gonna lie i've been pretty horrified by a lot of the media coverage of this a lot of people are just aggregating some of the cruelest commentary online and whipping it all up into a news story with absolutely no comment from caleb or nuance about the situation the top story on google yesterday was literally this house beautiful story that dox's caleb puts his full name in the story zero comment from this man sociopath behavior putting somebody's full name when they've wanted to stay anonymous smearing them without comment putting her phone number out there and she thinks that she has some moral high ground in this video because she didn't write that article she turns around and she does the exact same thing i don't know how many times i can show these examples and talk about it the woman is a fraud and thank god people on the internet are seeing right through her i mean she's been trending for like three days and not in a good way she has zero self-awareness and she seriously needs dr phil she might be irony impaired well that's a pleasant way to put it that's a lot nicer than what i would say it's horrifying so that was all just lips of tick tock doing what she does best and reposting content from taylor again twitter beef they were going back and forth but then the whole internet jumped in and i mean the responses and memes have just been incredible i mean they've been firing off for like four days now somebody said we closed mental institutions in the 80s and 90s and gave them and their kids media jobs taylor lorenz is brian stelter with testosterone anyway this whole time taylor's basically been silent uh her replies and mentions are turned off because she is a scared little baby and she's literally been deleting negative comments that have slipped through the cracks she's really trying to cover her ass but the entire internet is against her right now so i really don't know how she's planning on saving herself but she did post one comment about all of this the amount of insane stuff that's happened to me over the past 24 hours has been unbelievable it is eye-opening to see how sophisticated and vicious these coordinated attacks have become i'm grateful to work at a company that takes these issues seriously and is supportive i'm doing great lady it's the internet if you do something stupid if you do something immoral people are going to criticize you you will get ratioed this is not some right wing scheme you did something awful and the entire world was like oh my god this crazy person now the last part of the story i promise we're almost there might be the most appalling the washington post put out the statement taylor lorenz is an accomplished and diligent journalist whose reporting methods comport entirely with the washington post professional standards chair chick sorry if i'm butchering the name inner management of the libs of tick tock twitter account and in media interviews has had significant impact on public discourse and her identity has become public knowledge on social media we did not publish or link to any details about her personal life how dumb do you think i am and this whole thing about her identity had become public knowledge no it wasn't taylor did that your publication docks a woman who is now facing death threats i mean they have no shame these journalists think that they can gaslight us and spin lies on a daily basis and face no repercussions or accountability they lack a moral compass and they care more about their agenda than publishing any kind of truth so yeah in this twitter beef i'm siding with libs of tik tok it's literally a no-brainer hey guys we're adding new comment section content every

talked about New York City a few times in the last month or so we've talked about Eric Adams and his Ridiculousness we talked a couple of weeks ago about the rising crime in New York that is just a constant situation that is just getting worse and worse by the day but thankfully for New York city mayor Eric Adams he's there to fix all of your problems the rising crime the homelessness the illegal immigrants the insane tax rates the struggling school system you name it he's got a plan for it and he's actually really cutting through the mess I've been surprised and he's really hitting on some serious problems in New York and that's their rats literally now before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to the channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection obviously I was joking there I do not think mayor Eric Adams is doing a good job whatsoever and he is chosen to focus on New York City's rat problem rather than any of the other significant life-threatening issues that are going on in that City and I'm not saying that the rat problem is non-existent because have you seen New York it's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man I'm just saying it's a good way to distract people and avoid doing anything of any substance but it's real now this news posted this yesterday and said New York city mayor Eric Adams is declaring a war on rats after rodent sightings across the city have increased 71 since 2020 as part of its new plan the Adams admin will restrict how many hours trash bags are allowed to sit on New York City street curbs and here is what good old Eric had to say about it everyone that knows me they know one thing I hate rats today we are announcing a once in a generation change that would have a real impact on the cleanliness cleanliness of our city we are drastically reducing the amount of time that garbage will remain on our curb with Shifting the time where people can sit sit set out black bags and trash from 4 pm to 8 P.M this will reduce the amount of time the trash is on the street before collection keeping our streets clean up for a longer period of time and discouraging rodents from running their own version of what we like to say open restaurants every time I see a press conference like this especially in local government I'm just reminded that Parks and Recreation is one of the greatest sitcoms ever created because it's not outlandish it's real life all of those characters we see them in local government like right in front of us I also love that Eric Adams said we are making a once in a generation change to fix the cleanliness of RC like dude fixing the rat problem attempting to fix the rat problem that's not a once in a generation change maybe fixing the homelessness problem the drug problem the crime problem that could fix the cleanliness and the safety that I would think is a once in a generational change saying that people can only put their trash bags out at 8 pm rather than 4 pm you're not really getting stuff done that's a solo jet at getting stuff done that's just looking ridiculous and trying to distract from the fact that your whole city and your Administration is a dumpster fire we did it Patrick we saved the city I just have to drive this home it is real there are mainstream media people talking about it Bloomberg posted this yesterday and said New York City's answer to its rat problem asking you to take out the trash later thank you mainstream media for really reporting on the important hard-hitting news and don't get me wrong like I said New York City does actually have a rat problem it is disgusting those streets are filthy somebody said rats outnumber the people in New York City three to one that is horrific but do I want you caring about that over me getting stabbed on the subway probably not I can handle a rat I can't handle getting stabbed and you know it should be addressed but like I said I would not put it at the top of the priority list people are already having opinions online about the initiative about the war on rats like this girl said it's a battle rat sightings in New York City the city is asking us to take out the trash at 8 pm instead of 4 pm okay so instead of trying to eradicate the problem through extermination we're offering the rats dinner instead of An Inconvenient late lunch it sounds like a deal to me yeah I mean she is making an excellent point because at 3 30 PM I am still full from my midday snack break I'm not trying to cook a steak at 4pm like I want my good ranchers at 8 pm not 4 P.M and actually speaking of good deals so I told you about the good ranchers oktober Feast this month when you use my discount code you will get two pounds of better than organic chicken with any order and if you spend over 300 you will get an additional two pounds of ground wagyu beef and guys this is not a deal you want to miss out on because can you imagine going to a grocery store to buy your meat having to step over these awful New York City rats to get your steak now I don't think so good ranchers will give you the highest quality meat they have a 100 satisfaction guarantee you know exactly where your meat is sourced from and you don't have to go through the hassle of going to a grocery store dealing with people dealing with rats it is literally the best thing imaginable so if you want to try them out go to goodranchers.com Cooper and then use that promo code Cooper at checkout for the October Feast again goodranchers.com Cooper promo code Cooper at checkout now in addition to this entire initiative just being a bit ridiculous the presser itself and how they announced it is just like an absolute Meme and Twitter wasted no time dealing with it this girl Emma Court said New York City is limiting the hours when trash is taken out because of the issues with rats and it's genuinely hard to pick a favorite quote from today's presser pick your fighter and then she goes and lists some of the quotes I have a couple of them in this video that I just want you to hear and then I'll read the rest of the quotes the rats are absolutely going to hate this announcement but the rats don't run the city we do this is not Ratatouille rats are not our friends look at Eric Adams behind there so Regal so serious like he's making such significant change Here Comes team in the sanitation department is talking about Ratatouille that is not serious political work but some of the other comments were just chef's kiss she's replying in this thread and she says quote there are many rivers that are feeding the Sea of rodents in the city and today we are damning one of them the biggest swing you can take in cleaning up our streets is shutting down the all-night all you can eat rat Buffet that's good and then she says finally from the Department of Sanitation commissioner Jessica Tisch New Yorkers will not have to fear as many rats hiding in late night Shadows the way Master Splinter suggested the big scary rats I genuinely cannot choose one but somebody said quote four score and seven years ago and then I have a dream the rats are going to hate this announcement This is speech writing in its highest form there are a bunch of people that were like wait how much do freelance speechwriters get paid in New York City because I could do that and you know what I I will say I do have good news for New York City because even though your city is a crime-ridden dumpster fire filled with very large very Brazen rats you might feel like you have the worst situation but you don't because coming in as the most rat infested city in America is not New York City it's Chicago rap TV proudly posted this yesterday and said Chicago ranked number one for most rattiest city in the U.S with LA and New York City close behind it and there were some people in the comments and we're like hell yeah take that Chicago New York City is the best I was like being like the second or third that really isn't winning in my book so guys that's it for today that is your news from the front lines from the battleground of New York City we've been talking about a lot of heavier hitting topics on the show recently yesterday's episode about those disgusting pedophilic laws in California I just wanted to give you something a little more light-hearted but still is obviously heavy hitting journalism because guys the war on rats it's just beginning and I will be here the entire time to fill you in hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "v42r5tKGuXM": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper i think we all know because we've chatted about it a few times now that the midterms are approaching it's the freaking midterms they are coming up november is you know arriving faster than any of us really expected and the democrats are on a war path to say the least they are using every fear tactic in the book seeing what sticks because i think that they know that a red wave is coming and unsurprisingly they are getting big tech involved once again but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and for more content you can always follow me on instagram at i'm brett cooper and we'll see if i can last on that platform i've been doing pretty well so far instagram has not taken me down with twitter i've also never received a strike which is fascinating especially because yesterday twitter safety tweeted out that starting today we will begin enforcing the civic integrity policy in context of the us 2022 midterms civic integrity i love social media platforms saying that they have integrity they replied to their own tweet and said this means that we will take action against misleading claims about the voting process misleading content intended to intimidate or dissuade people from participating in the election or misleading claims that may undermine public confidence and election outcomes i hate that line undermining public confidence like the propaganda is just blatant i don't know if you guys remember this but a few months ago tick tock did something similar where they said that you could cannot post any videos that undermine public confidence in government health bodies you actually steal a kia is it an easy process hell yeah could you choice for how it looks to steal a car i can show you inside your car that's a platform that i actually do know a lot about dealing with those kinds of strikes because you cannot even say anything remotely inquisitive you cannot even use critical thinking to make your own mind up about anything related to a government health body or politics or elections i think tick tock has this same policy for elections it's like you want us all to just sit around and believe this exact same prescribed narrative and you're not even hiding it and people go for it and these comments are going oh my god this is so good thank you for protecting us can you believe all these trumpers in the comments that are so upset about it it's like no it's not just trumpers like this is your freedom of speech that we're talking about you should be concerned as well siraj responded to them and said recommended for you please shut the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up you're one to duck yeah that's pretty accurate another person said your track record of failures on both a identifying misinformation and b applying your policies consistently means that pretty much all of us know you're just saying we're going to suppress any story that makes a democrat look bad yeah literally could not have said it better myself but my favorite part of this entire thread was that people immediately started pulling up old tweets from democrats from people like stacy abrams uh nancy pelosi who were all undermining public confidence in elections hypocrite warning saying like trump stole the election from hillary that stacy abrams lost because that election was stolen in georgia all of these things and said oh are these tweets going to be taken down because they haven't been and they've been up for years and then a lot of people kept retweeting this 10 minute compilation of every prominent democrat denying donald trump won the presidential election in 2016. you can run the best campaign you can even become the nominee and you can have the election stolen from you it's so good how can you win with russian interference though that's something i'm scared about but rightly because i think he's an illegitimate president that didn't really win so how do you you know fight against that in 2020 you are absolutely right he's an illegitimate president in my mind would you be my vice president for canada folks look i absolutely agree trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. he lost the election and he was put into office because the russians interfered trump knows he's an illegitimate president the president elect although legally elected is not legitimate i don't see it as president-elect as a legitimate president you said you believe that russia's interference altered the outcome of the election i do i mean literally everything that they are doing is undermining confidence in our election procedures whatever they want to call it and these are not just randos off the street these are high elite democrats that are making life-changing decisions in our government i mean right now the senate and the house are democrat controlled we have no idea what the hell is going to happen in november i hope it's a red wave but if not we all need to make sure that we are awake we are aware and we are protected and one of the best ways to do that is by creating a will with epic will because if you don't have a will the state will decide what happens with all of your money with all of your asset and what happens to your loved ones do you really want to leave your future in the hands of people like nancy pelosi i don't think any of us want that so to avoid all of that you can just go online and get it done today at epicwheel.com make sure to use promo code cooper for 10 off of your complete will package again that is epic will.com promo code cooper and guys it literally takes five minutes five minutes to protect yourself from weird little lizard nancy pelosi taking all of your money even though she's basically already doing that already because taxation other people were talking about the other horrific things that occur on twitter uncensored und platformed like somebody said can you please redirect your energy to removing child pornography somebody replied and said no that would require providing actual safety at twitter safety is performative and corrupt which basically you could say about every big tech platform and every body of government to be quite honest everything they do is virtue signaling i stand here today a proud first generation latina and officer at cia it's not just hollywood it's literally everything in our lives is to appease this really angry passionate one percent that has found some way to use mind control to warp our entire society and by doing all of this they are making us as weak quiet and poor and unarmed as possible i mean they are doing everything in their power to control every aspect of our lives i wanted to read a tweet from thomas massey uh this was just a day ago he said last week the democrats in the house passed a bill to ban americans from buying ar-15s calling the ar-15 a weapon of war they exempted the irs from the ban this week they will add tens of thousands of irs agents to the budget 87 000 i know i've touched on this briefly in a couple of episodes but they are adding 87 000 irs agents in this tweet he linked the irs job posting and just read this so you need to adhere to the high standards of conduct work a minimum of 50 hours per week including your regular hours be on call 24 7. uh maintain a level of fitness necessary to effectively respond to life-threatening situations on the job as an irs agent carry a firearm and be willing to use deadly force if necessary be willing to carry a weapon of war to hunt you down for your 600 venmo payment be willing and able to participate in arrests execution of search warrants and other dangerous assignments they are literally coming after american citizens tulsi gabbard tweeted out and said biden's big spending bill takes 80 billion dollars of our money to hire more irs agents to take more of our money and snoop on what we share on venmo cash apps they are not going after the wealthy they are coming for small businesses entrepreneurs and hardworking americans i mean i cannot emphasize this more they are infiltrating every single aspect of our lives to make us dependent upon them upon the government that is the simplest way to say it from you know not having enough food on the shelves not being able to pay bills not being able to get to work because of gas not being able to say what you think on social media not being able to protect your home from an intruder all of this goes back to being fully reliant on this corrupt authoritarian government body elon was tweeting about all of this irs stuff and he said fate loves irony when the country that revolted over taxes hires 87 000 new irs agents which is just sad and lydia from timcast tim's producer said they're not going after you they're coming for us and elon responded and said true i already get audited every year by default so it is a blatant lie for anybody telling you that oh no these irs agents are just to tax the wealthy we're gonna go after the wealthy no they already pay their fair share elon musk paid more money in taxes than any other individual in american history they're fine they're going after middle class americans normal people that are just trying to get by and to tie this all back to twitter's new civic integrity protocol or whatever crap you want to call it people with clout big commentators conservative organizations any you know big group that decides to go against the grain joe rogan they will not actually be permanently silenced because they have the clout and they have the influence to get back on to create a new account what i am most concerned about are the people that get wiped off the internet for tweeting some wrong thing but only have you know 15 followers a thousand followers and can't get back on because they don't have the influence or sway and their voices are immediately silenced that is what we should be concerned about normal americans being controlled that's what this all goes back to hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "k3ONeY8ifTs": "hahaha you and I both know that you are capable of enjoying the rain and frolicking freely without filming it and then posting it to tick tock now you've just co-signed okay you've just co-signed at least 3 million 8.5 by 11 front and back people who just go out of their way to disrespect and dismiss the boundaries that black creators have set and now you're one of those people why is it so important to all of you to treat us like we don't matter do you literally have so little joy in your life that you sit around trying to push racism into every single aspect of your life I think so rain is not racist I can't imagine seeing somebody giggling in nature and making a negative and about my own issues this is some Brokenness who Lord literally", "W3-Sl92HEMQ": "here's what I find so tragic about these young pretty conservative women you're such a gaslighted demographic because one of the pillars of this ideology that you're bought into is that some people are just inherently Superior you know women are technically property but you you don't have to worry about that because you are hot property exceptions will be made for you no so you're more than willing to play into this needlessly cruel game because you've been assured that you'll win and soon the young winning man of your dreams will look at you and say yes that is what I'm supposed to want and acquiring her will make me look like a superior man oh my God okay so how much do you guys want to bet that this woman is divorced me wanting to get married someday does not mean that I inherently believe that I am property and there is a difference between a woman choosing a bad partner and having a hard life versus some like handmaid's tale ideology about female oppression those are two very different things", "iVKB0mSliY0": "but Dad please know that while I am grateful and highly aware of all that you give in this family I still don't miss you when you died I felt like there was a hole I missed something but it wasn't you it was the idea of what you could become I miss being able to Hope and wish that one day you turn the corner and see the world from my perspective because when you died it solidified the fact that she'll never be what you could have been but only what you are and what you are is a racist misogynistic xenophobic trump-loving citrate white man that is all you will ever be to me and Dad before you tell me to respect the dead please remember that you disrespected and disregarded the lives and deaths of entire communities of people with your Idol this is at her father's funeral you are a racist Trump loving CIS white girl have some freaking decency if you watch my show at all you know that I don't really have the closest relationship with my father but at least I try my dad's a Democrat but you know what I wouldn't do I wouldn't stand up at this funeral and say oh screw you these people are vile but they claim to be loving intolerant", "H60Bpx0jHlM": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper last week alan west who was just running as a republican for the governor of texas went to speak at the university of buffalo on behalf of yaf which is young americans for freedom his speech was about how today's america is not a racist country he told stories about growing up in the south he's from atlanta uh on the edge of the jim crow era everything he had to endure and how much better things are now sounds like a fantastic speech and if you know if i mean if you follow daily wire folks you know that a lot of our people also do yaf speeches and quite often they are accompanied by insane college student protesters screaming about how we're all bigots and racists and transphobic you know etc nothing new i thought that was pretty racist so unsurprisingly the same thing happened for alan west the clips started circulating on twitter almost immediately and they're just too good to not discuss this is before the event has even started there's overflow because not everybody could get into the auditorium or wherever it was being held and look at these people they're standing outside the doors and then inside west beach apparently went well no hiccups until the q a portion and this might be my favorite clip i apologize it goes on for a bit but look at this girl asking a question you talked a lot about um the fact that the reason why america is using values that it dies because of two parent households and your fatherless whatever the hell you're talking about and also like can you as a black man literally okay so she goes on this like accusatory rant like how dare you tell us about your experiences i'm sorry honey that's what he's here to do so sit down she's asking all of these questions like why did you say this what do you mean by that alan west then starts to answer he goes well let me start by and then she's all like i don't i don't want to hear i don't want to hear and then everybody starts applauding like i don't know how many protesters got in there to make that much noise girl if you're going to be that loud and passionate maybe wait around to hear the answer to your multitude of questions you might learn something like if you care that much maybe like extend that to listening we're all supposed to be like listening and learning that extends to you too also side note question in the nicest way possible every one of these videos that i watch from college campuses screeching do something different just give me give me more variety i don't care so the speech ends and then chaos ensues people are standing outside the room trying to intimidate and insult the people who were inside listening to alan west and then they get so bad that campus pd had to come and escort alan west out of the building [Applause] oh that escalated quickly there's just a lot to dig in first of all every single one of them is recording come on guys live in the real world let's get off our phones you're gonna be protesting like be in be in the moment i guess they're also screaming black lives matter and i'm black and i'm proud to a black man which i'm sorry do you not see the irony it's like these statements don't even mean anything of substance anymore they're just protester buzzwords that are easy for people to jump on and start saying the other thing about that that killed me was they switch over from black lives matter to i'm black and i'm proud and i just had to stop the video and like slowly scrub through to see all the white kids who are then like holding their phones being like what do i say because everybody's saying i'm black and i'm proud and there's a couple of them that are mouthing things and i'm like are you trans race now or do we all just say that i'm black and i'm proud it just kind of cracked me up somebody did comment on that love the white people saying i'm black and i'm proud it's it's all charades guys okay the last thing and probably the oddest and most weird why was there a spider-man just hanging out on the stairs the whole time [Music] dude's just like straight chilling no he's the only one living in the moment he doesn't have his phone out so like props to you man like did he just want to come but be incognito or was he leaving like buffalo comic-con and just ended up here and there were a bunch of comments about it like what spider-man on the steps just chilling it's a shame stephen hawking is dead and can't explain to us the cosmic level of stupidity on the left why was the bureau of land management there when i moved to idaho i lived in idaho for about nine months it's where my my family's farm is idaho was mostly public land and i kept seeing signs for blm land and i was like come on i just left california for this and these people are here too they're just hoping to get a sweet 3 million mansion now they're trying to get a six million dollar mansion if you guys aren't following that story i urge you to check it out there's a whole lot going on i'll probably talk about it soon blm even did a apology where they promised to listen and learn and grow so you know that's good then things get a little rougher and the protesters start going after the attendees after alan west has left which you can sort of see in this video what is this it's not accomplishing anything trying to pull people's phones down and like wave gatorade at them you're just making yourself look worse not a good tactic and then they began targeting the yaf student president who organized the event [Applause] they're going after there i know but you hear one person say they're going after therese that's the chapter president she had to rush into a men's restroom with a friend to hide and then the protesters stood outside and were banging on the door and other people were yelling find her find her while she waited for campus pd to come i mean it's disgusting and it happens all the time like this not even a phenomenon but peers turning on their conservative students in a very violent manner i mean i made a video last month about a similar situation in texas and the president of that conservative student club was also targeted and physically chased down by her peers she was also like grabbed by campus police and like whipped out of there i mean conservative students get physically attacked all the time people make up lies to get them expelled their peers try to ruin their reputation i mean it's like people have lizard brain and they become animalistic and how they're behaving towards these these other students and it's the state of a lot of higher education it's real and it's happening every day i mean i thought it was bad when i had those communist manifestos checked in my head everybody knows that story at this point now i was called a southern racist at a few parties by my friends yeah clearly things have only gone downhill so let's just have some civility people especially students because you're not really helping the reputation of our country right now let's pack it up let's clean it up hey guys we're adding new comment section content every day so make sure you like subscribe and ring that bell

itself and then their name is Magpie this belongs to them they were going by themselves for bug it would be bug's name is Magpie the sweater belongs to bug bug was going by bug self and then for dirt it would be dirt as Magpie the sweater belongs to dirt dirt was going brighter itself you can use these interchangeably in a sentence you can use just one of them or you can use different ones at different times I think that this person has it's not the multiple personality there's some other new word for it that they're using because sometimes they respond as Tau sometimes they respond as Magpie but then also they can go by dirt and bug I watch your videos weekly and I still don't get it I have I truly do not understand somebody replied and said they have to create new pronouns in

[Music] probably saw his mother begging her son to come home after she lost him to the drug pandemic on Venice Beach Venice Beach is disgusting but it's not just on Venice Beach I mean this is literally in every major city we have a mental health problem we have a drug problem in this country I don't even really want to read any comments on this because it's just a lot of people sympathizing with the mother to be totally honest my family has been there my brother was homeless for many years we have drug problems in our family I have lived this it is one of the biggest problems that this country faces and politicians that we elect are doing nothing and culturally we are doing nothing it's sad", "gZJBdrHOcww": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper guys I have been playing video games recently obviously you have seen the videos I did Resident Evil 7 whatever that thing was called the horrific dramatic game I've also played some Call of Duty super sick shot some things it was great but now I'm gonna go back to my roots and we are going to talk about the Sims but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com to check out my merch collection I used to play Sims on my mom's phone I had Sims FreePlay downloaded in addition to like some random horse grooming game that I had because I was not allowed to have a phone I didn't have a computer so when we would be in the car sometimes on road trips I would be allowed to use her like first generation iPhone to play Sims FreePlay and I remember that every time I had like a crush on a guy I would make him in Sims like force him to be with my Sims it was like a whole ordeal I think I also had one of the original Sims on an old desktop that was in my mom's office I don't know but I've played it years and years ago have not even thought about Sims recently but a subscriber a wonderful girl named Mel from Australia sent in some wild content about Sims 4. so Mel this is for you thank you for sending it in so apparently there is a game mod for Sims 4 it is called wicked whims and it basically makes the game R-rated and gives you a ton of new features including being able to have an abortion and in doing some research it looks like this is not the first mod that is you know given you this feature but this is the one that is most popular and has gotten people talking about it here is the Reddit post that Mel sent me it says hasta la vista baby and then this person puts a screenshot of their Sim immediately having an abortion she's doing some flirty nonsense she's not wearing a shirt she's like and then it says hasta la vista baby from pregnancy termination it's boosting happy it's boosting flirty and then it says when the stress is gone the party can go on so we're saying that the moment you have an abortion it's like yeah back to the club right now let's do run it back let's do it again here we go again I mean this really is just disgusting I mean like our culture is so far gone if we think that this is just a joke and you know like I'm all for comedy and humor and that sort of thing but this really does disgust me and I it just makes me glad that I do have companies organizations that I can support that take a stand against this like new me skincare because if you guys didn't know not only is Nami skincare an excellent skincare brand but they also give back to pro-life and pro-women organizations as you guys probably know now I've been using Mimi skin care for almost a year it has completely changed the game when it comes to my skin I literally recommend it to everybody I meet right now I'm actually using a bit of a mixture between their hydride and protect bundle and their daily glow bundle and it's been perfect for my skin so if you guys want to try this out go to nimiskincare.com use promo code Cooper at checkout for 15 off your order again that is nimiskincare.com promo code Cooper at checkout because in a world when people are making jokes and about abortion and trying to normalize it into something that is flirty and silly I'm just very happy to know that I have these organizations on my side apparently though this is just one reaction that your sim can have depending on what traits or orientation you have for that specific Sim so they might have different responses somebody said what are her traits my Sims are always crying in the bed after that yeah because that's what real life is like actually thank you very much somebody replied and said if they have the family oriented trait they will regret it and become very sad so I made sure to never have those types of Sims have an abortion like that just weirds me out like I'm not gonna have them be family oriented like sir do you do this often enough that you have learned what Sims are better to have abortions than not is this just a very normal thing when we talk about progressives being experts at normalizing their issues and inserting them into culture effortlessly this is it because everybody on this Reddit thread is going haha this is so funny oh my God I make my Sims have abortions all the time it's so funny no it's not freaking funny I don't care if it's a game we're talking about a real life serious issue I don't care how much propaganda you've seen how much you've been gaslit after an abortion a woman is not feeling flirty and trying to go back to the club I found some of the other like responses that a Sim would have on Twitter there's one that says true relief maybe they'll have a solemn moment the end one says have not forgotten there's another one that boosts angry and it's how dare they judge it says Marie's termination of pregnancy was made really difficult by the people outside of the Family Planning Hospital who were criticizing her and yelling they had no idea what she's been through she'll be relieved eventually but for now she is in shock and angry yeah let's talk about those pro-lifers outside of Planned Parenthood or whatever other people in the subreddit were a bit more Brazen and really leaning into the happy peppy flirty abortion mood somebody said thank God I was so tired of the abortion option bringing my Sims days long sadness Buffs somebody else said real life people terminating a pregnancy should be a right for any woman for any reason but it's not a casual decision that people make lightly you are making a life choice for a potential person it is not a joke Wicked whims players knee-deep in disassociation melodrama LOL by Bish somebody else said I mean I think people can casually make any decision they want their life their body life should be more like sin for no one cares what everybody else is doing now I really would not like life to be more like the sins we're all just happily going around and killing babies thank you very much that's just gross somebody else said LOL not the abortion making her flirty somebody else said Different Strokes for different folks you don't have to find it funny but the rest of us do somebody else said okay but she is just like me for real fetus deletus life should not be more like The Sims where you can just make mistakes or regret decisions and then just hit delete and avoid all responsibility that is a terrible Habit to have that is a terrible thing to normalize The Sims themselves the game creator they have not made abortion a regular feature of the game but they have very publicly supported abortion rights this tweet is from June after Roe v Wade was overturned and instead we understand that today is hard as a first step we want to connect you our community to a few resources that can help you at this time and then they have this little infographic they say we understand that today is hard for those who play The Sims the game has always been about being who you want to be loving who you want to love and creating the life you want to live our game is a reflection of our unwavering belief that everyone has a right to choose how they want to live their life without judgment including the right to bodily autonomy as a first step we want to connect to you our community to a few resources that can help support you at this time and then they like link a bunch of abortion stuff but he commented and said why can't you get an abortion in Sims 4 what is this Texas Texas calm down like that is the least of your problems somebody said why bring so much politics into the game The Sims is a game stop bringing politics into a life simulator that already has the Liberty to do everything we want absolutely based somebody else said not all your players agree should stick to making the game enjoyable for everyone and stay out of politics I 100 agree and I was very happy to see that most of the comments under that post were people going like I really don't care I don't need my like online game telling me what to think about politics it's just ridiculous but then of course there were a couple of comments like this somebody replied and said add abortion as a feature in the free update help normalize the right to bodily autonomy I mean I kind of appreciate that this person wrote this comment because they're not even hiding that this is how they move the needle and normalize things I can't even be angry because they are good at it this is what the left does they are able to insert their agenda into every single aspect of our culture and Society so that you know years down the line people are going hahaha this is so funny abortion it's such a joke makes us flirty it's totally fine like they are effective but to The Sims like people play your games people play these types of games they watch movie they watch entertainment to escape life is already hard enough this world is disgusting in a dumpster fire don't insert more politics into something that people are using as an escape it's just weird leave it alone hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "JldyXJWdeY0": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper one of the hottest events of the season happened last week and are you baby thinking is this the med gala is this the oscars the oscars just happened nope it was the white house correspondents association dinner thrilling event full of very real news hard-hitting journalism and our favorite president joe biden and it was hosted by the one and only trevor noah let's do this people i mean i i do joke about that but actually i did make two videos where i watched a couple of his clips in the last couple of months and he was semi based but i think it's because he's so far left that he hates biden so we can kind of agree on the fact that we don't like him but i think it's for very different reasons but regardless he said some things that i actually think are funny so i'm gonna give him that credit cause he's gotten a little better but anyway he hosted the white house correspondents center and the clips from this event have circulated twitter for the past few days so i thought it was only right that we go through and we laugh at these journalists so to start us off we're going to look at a couple of clips from biden's opening monologue everyone had to prove they were fully vaccinated and boosted so if you're at home watching this and you're wondering how to do that just contact your favorite fox news reporter they're all here vaccinated and boosted all of them in my opinion i highly doubt that everybody in that room is vaccinated i'm sure that you could get around it if you so choose because there are you know special rules for us lowly people and the people at the top really don't have to follow those people in the comments were saying peter isn't too happy about that joke yeah no there was the another person said those women's reactions to him saying they had to prove they were vaccinated boosted makes me feel like they didn't have to should we re-watch look at this you have to see this lady there's two of them so that lady right there she's going oh what what that woman is going oh god oh who is that nope and then peter's like no maybe not maybe not so again maybe we'll never know but that was awkward to say the least i'm really uncomfortable he went on to make fun of republicans again because what else is he going to do well i'm not worried about the midterms i'm not worried about them we may end up with more partisan gridlock but i'm confident we can work it out during my remaining six years of the presidency and folks i'm not really here to roast the gop that's not my style besides there's nothing i can say about the gop that kevin mccarthy hasn't already put on tape you know [Applause] at the same at the same time a lot of people say the republican party is too extreme too divisive too controlled by one person they say that's not your father's republican party ronald reagan said mr gorbachev tear this wall down today's republicans say tear down mickey mouse's house and pretty soon they'll be storming cinderella's castle you can be sure but very awkward and cringy a republican seem to support one fellow some guy named brandon he's having a really good year and i'm kind of happy for him hey brandon how dumb do you think i am at least he's self-aware ian who works with us here said who wrote these jokes amy schumer i was good ian that was good someone else said that bow tie is hanging on for dear life it likes it slowly makes its way higher and higher like why did nobody where is his wardrobe people why did jill not go honey let's fix that somebody help him even his tie is leaning to the far left when did we last all see this man during any state appearance looking this sharp speaking so clearly with an actual sense of comedic timing oh combined with no stutters no lapses no inappropriate facial expressions or postures what did they do to him or with him well i wouldn't say that he had an actual sense of comedic timing i think that his comedy is probably on par with trevor noah and that's you know saying something but i was semi-impressed with the fact that he got through that without a pause and like a his like eye rub like i need to know what kind of drug cocktail they've you know put into him maybe this is an ai i'm a cybernetic organism living tissue over a metal endoskeleton but it was i was i will i give i will um i stutter too much there now i sound like biden oh my god what's happening to me i will say that i was impressed with how he got through it the fact that i have to say that is depressing that means that the bar is like on the ground but for him it was okay uh now we're gonna get into trevor he takes on his part of the evening thank you for being here thank you for having me here you know i was a little confused about why me but then i was told that you get your highest approval ratings when a biracial african guy standing next to you so uh that was actually funny but can we just take a moment to look at biden's face and watch him not in agreement when trevor says that what is happening like i don't think he knows the joke that's being told but he was told to sit there and laugh so he's doing so someone said he really said preach brother you damn right hours later he is still processing the joke yeah oh boy and then we had a bunch of biden simps in the comments uh there were a couple of good ones joe biden really is such a truly decent man maybe he's not the most decent president but the contrast with the last president is just so profound wow it's very deep like i said guys the bar is on the ground trevor had another joke here we're getting more progressively spicier and i think ever since you've come into office things are really looking up you know gas is up rent is up food is up everything no it really has been a tough first year for you mr president once again i guess it's nice that the people in this room are self-aware that's the most elitist comment that i've ever heard like let's just laugh at the struggles that everybody else is having look at that like maniacal laughter like i know that i'm screwing up our entire country but it's fine i mean at least the man can take a joke people in the comments were not enthused someone says the president of the united states is laughing at the pain americans are having financially that's tough republicans don't understand comedy because comedy requires empathy wow jason great that's just a truly profound statement it's not that we don't get humor i mean hell my entire life is making fun of these people and making light of these situations but that was just an incredibly tone-deaf and elitist comment sadly it was not the worst one thank you so much for having me i appreciate you please be careful leaving tonight we all know this administration doesn't handle evacuations well goodnight everybody thank you so much do you catch that that was like a throwaway as everybody is leaving everybody's standing up and applauding and he says please be careful leaving tonight we all know that this administration doesn't handle evacuations well like imagine being the family of one of the 13 american servicemen who died in the afghanistan withdrawal and then having the situation boiled down into a little biden oopsie i know that we got a little heavy there so to close this out i want to touch on the reporters who were not lucky enough to get an invitation whenever i need to laugh guys just go to cnn cnn plus failing cnn making things up cnn reporters being idiots like it's just a it's just a bank of comedy if people enjoy i don't know if this is the salad or the dessert portion of the meal uh it is the wine portion of the meal which is a very important portion tonight yes i do see that on the table right there it's kind of exciting though it's exciting it's been so oh we're really happy okay that was that wasn't the only one here we go we have another one no everyone looks great there we're just trying to give people the play-by-play of every minute i don't know what's going on there uh every minute that's an amazing time of this event yeah is that a tie i thought i thought it was a bit but i could is that a bib or a tie [Music] it's like a tie in an ascot a tascott it's a merger between the two are these people like clinically depressed at this point imagine that your life is so miserable that you have to sit and try to make the white house correspondence dinner exciting for the public just look at them these cnn personalities weren't invited to the white house center so they're in studio reenacting the last supper well the one positive thing you know to come out of all of this is that apparently covered really is over all it takes is one big elitist dinner and poof the plague is over but anyway i really don't know why we care about this event why there was live you know red carpet coverage of this but it did give some good content and it did just remind me how much i dislike elite journalists and politicians so i mean at least that's good i mean nothing like a room of elites and cringe jokes to remind me why i hate big government hey guys we're adding new

and their doctors like straight up refused to give them hysterectomies my situation is different because I am a trans man so meganing hysterectomy falls under a gender affirming surgery it is in relation personally to me for um like uh reproductive health care because I'm getting it taken out of me because I do not want to have babies I didn't have to fight it as much as people who are not like trans men have to fight it dude I don't think that this is the dunk that you think it is you are basically saying that because you need gender affirming care and you don't want to have babies you are okay with being prioritized over women that medically need hysterectomies like that's just Class A narcissism cringe somebody said I'm still so confused by that whole statement and by what that thing is as well very creepy yeah that's why I said dude it's just a kind of blanket statement it's easier somebody else said at least one of them is telling the truth for once yeah", "XjWknaWj2mI": "who are you touching our flags you have no right to do this this is America we have the First Amendment right of freedom of speech freedom of expression I don't know why you're taking my Flags down God she's so smug this happened at Trinity College and this administrator is ripping down these students don't tread on the American flag and their First Responders flag meanwhile on campus Pride flags and trans flags are allowed to stay up on campus even though there was apparently a directive from the dean saying that all Flags must be removed from dorms apparently that only applies to people with wrong think like these two students somebody said so they love freedom of choice as long as you choose what they want you to choose no disagreement if that will be tolerated Trinity College is a fascist regime straight shooting that's exactly what's happening another person said at least they sent Sergeant Karen yeah when she said she wanted to call campus safety that's ridiculous lady calm down all these kids are doing are asking questions because they know what you're doing is wrong", "Yb7Ve96d8H4": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper i don't think i need to remind you all of this event that happened with biden just a couple of weeks ago but in case you were unaware biden was taking one of his many many vacations back to lovely delaware that he loves with his entire heart and soul he was taking a bike ride he stopped to talk to some press couldn't get his toe out of the pedal and just went whoo slow motion fell onto the ground became a meme there were songs about it it was highly entertaining now the story continues but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode so biden fell a couple of weeks ago but the momentum around this event has not slowed down in the slightest the memes have continued to come and people are now going to visit the location in delaware where he fell off his bike but it didn't stop there the crosswalk where biden fell is now a historical landmark on google maps so here it is it has now been taken down because google is no fun this is a screenshot from when it was up you see the little square that was the crosswalk where he had his infamous slow motion fall and the person who created it called it brandon falls sounds like a lovely destination i can't wait to go visit there for my summer vacation it's going to be lovely i think that the people who run all of the old row accounts i think that they are behind this but they did post this so we might have them to thank they said we did it joe brandon falls is officially a historical landmark hashtag biden and so they you can see it here there's brandon falls but the internet did not stop there in addition to the landmark a bike shop popped up also called brandon falls they posted a picture with a let's go brandon flag in front of it that is also in delaware now his little bike path is also an official route on the workout and training app strava and so here's a screenshot of that also called brandon falls the best part of all of this were the reviews that people left on the original google historical landmark and as i said earlier google is no fun they have now removed the landmark they've removed the bike shop you can't find it anywhere but i have screenshots from some of these reviews and so today instead of diving into the replies of a twitter post or diving into the comment section on tick tock we are going to be diving in to google reviews this is really what i've always been called to do a must-see destination a reminder of what is really going on a very nice place to ride a bike just be careful to not cause too much inflation in your tire so you end up crashing your whole bike into the ground but if that happens just blame putin people will fall for it fall for it that was good i like that person some people say that if you look closely you can see the dementia from a mile away i love this wonderful place better than niagara falls a true hysterical landmark i came across this place by accident on my bicycle noticed a small oil slick or patch at the site might have been added there by a saudi for effect get your ice cream there as well but leave your kids at home my god but wait dash vlog everybody said scenery is amazing just be mindful of the treacherous terrain great tacos and ice cream not kid friendly that really is the biden family don't bring your kids around them but it's a great place to get some chocolate chocolate chip and some breakfast tacos the diversity truly drag queen friendly but not kid friendly watch out for the poop though dear god these people are relentless those are just some of my favorites and i wish that google had left it up i think people made additional landmarks once google got rid of the first one but they have been on the prowl and cutting all of this which is too bad so i'm happy that i have these screenshots but it was just a reminder of how much i love the internet and now the internet can come together so quickly for a joke it really makes my job easier it makes my life easier it makes my life more entertaining and i just really enjoy it kind of cracks me up because there are still people that are going why are we making fun of him like why like let the internet have its fun yes the man is old and probably has dementia i have no idea why he actually fall whether it was because he couldn't get his toe out of the pedal or because you know the sun was in his eyes if the sun was in his eyes he should have been using some bond charge sunglasses i talk all the time about my very favorite bond charge blue light blocking glasses but what you might not know is the bond charge also makes sunglasses that filter down 100 of uv light while also filtering down blue light and this is all part of their rebranding from blue blocks to bond charge which is now an expanded wellness brand that helps you optimize your health they have products to help you perform better sleep better balance your hormones reduce inflammation literally everything that by needs can someone please send him some bond charge products that is literally all i'm asking but until we get him some of these products i want you all to check them out so go to bondcharge.com use promo code cooper to get 20 off of your order that is bondcharge.com use promo code cooper i'm telling you these products work and even though our president's health is failing you can make sure yours is thriving and we can continue laughing at biden because i think that's healthy in addition to these comments in addition to the bike shop and the historical landmark like i said earlier people are literally visiting this little crosswalk at a beach in delaware to do a biden trend i feel very left out and now i think that i need to go and do this trend especially because as you all know i don't really know how to ride a bike so it would probably be very authentic if i rode a bike over the crosswalk i would probably fall just like biden so it's not totally fair for me to make fun of him but i'm going to do it anyway because if i fell on my bike i would hope that everybody else would make fun of me as well old row has an entire thread dedicated to this trend which they are called biden and the trend is that you either post a photo of you falling off of your bike wherever you are or at the location the thread is miles long and never ends but these are some of my favorites this girl really just i mean the commitment ass is all the way up that looks like an incredibly uncomfortable position another one here these chads these frat bros went and visited brandon falls saluting it christening it really just showing their admiration for our commander-in-chief this person also went and visited brandon falls and did a full face plant right in the center i appreciate the fact that there are people riding their bikes behind it and they're people watching i just would love to know the response of people who are maybe huge biden fans or have no idea what's going on and they're just on vacation they suddenly see all of these people going and doing face plants in a random crosswalk at a random beach in delaware i just love it i love it this guy really got the slow motion fall down which is an art i think that was the thing that i really loved the most about that video of biden was that it was not an aggressive crash it wasn't like he was doing something cool or he was really being athletic and going like the poor man had his little toe stuck in the bike you know pedal cap thing i'm not gonna pretend like i know what it is i barely know how to ride a bike and he was sitting there trying to talk to people he couldn't get it out and you knew that he was going to fall it was like the most slow motion and he kind of gave in he was like all right i guess i'm going down and he crashed it's truly art all in all this might be my favorite biden gaff from his entire presidency although when he was running when he was doing his campaign his whole was also a classic very poetic phrase i really did enjoy that one but i am hoping since we have you know a couple more years with him that we will have some other fantastic events that i can use for content some trends i mean just yesterday he apparently said that he has cancer now he has kovid do we know if any of that is true no idea the man is falling apart in front of our very eyes maybe that will spark a trend these days i just really don't even know guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that

all know fourth of july was this past weekend i hope everybody had a fantastic time it is one of my very very favorite days of the year sadly i really didn't do much this fourth of july i had friends in town up until the day before so i was just kind of dead tired don't disturb my friend he's dead tired to be quite honest i slept and then i watched some fireworks while i was running errands and getting groceries so not very eventful but i hope you all had a very fantastic weekend now before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode alright so i feel like most people watching this channel probably have some appreciation for the 4th of july [Music] kind of enjoy celebrating it the red white and blue barbecue all of that stuff but every year the libs find some reason to demand that none of us celebrate the fourth of july and this year unsurprisingly it was all about the supreme court now we started out strong the morning of the fourth when npr announced that they would be breaking their 33-year tradition of reading the declaration of independence on air because our country just isn't free enough for that is what they were saying and instead of reading it they hosted some liberal thinkers to have a conversation on equality and equity and they said this july 4th we break with tradition instead of reading the declaration of independence we will examine what equality means and has meant in this document important segment about our past and our future which is probably the most cringe way to start our national holiday really not starting off on the strongest foot but then the celebrities of course had to jump in jessica chastain the uh one of the redheads i know i always get her and amy adams confused listen guys you have the hollywood chris's you've got the chris hemsworth chris pratt chris pine and then you've got like the trifecta of redheads you have amy adams you've got jessica chastain you got the girl that's in jurassic park dallas bryce howard i think is her name so anyway jessica chastain part of the redhead click she posts on twitter happy independence day for me and my reproductive rights so edgy classy wonderful she got absolutely torched in the comments somebody said feel free to use your independence to leave the greatest country in the world you know the one in which you built your career made yourself a name anytime you want you won't be missed there were also people posting flights to um different places in the middle east saying oh if you want to go to some free country sure go ahead have fun which you know is harsh but i also think it's important to acknowledge the fact that you can be upset with your country you can have opinions uh you know about things going on things in government you can be angry and you can still appreciate the fact that you do have freedom that you have been able to work your way up and become massively famous massively rich massively successful all because we live in a country that allows you to have those opportunities honestly it just seems like jessica needs an attitude adjustment and maybe a good night's sleep i don't know you know somebody who could help her with that is bond charge my very very favorite blue light glasses company blue blocks has rebranded to bond charge they are now a fantastic wellness brand with a huge range of products that help you sleep better perform better recover better balance your hormones reduce inflammation reduce headaches but of course my favorite products for them are still the classic blue light glasses i mean you guys know that i stare at a computer all day long scrolling twitter reddit tick tock finding content for you guys and i used to have awful eye strain and awful headaches but since i have been using these glasses for the past few months all of that has gone away unlike other blue light glasses bond charges glasses are created in optics laboratories in australia and they are backed by real science so you know that they work go to bondcharge.com cooper and use promo code cooper at checkout for 20 off of your purchase you will not regret it these really are going to optimize your life and honestly if more libs started using their products they probably would be happier the biggest thing that i see is that none of these people have any gratitude anyway rant over somebody else said doesn't mean do you mean cause your age you're independent from using these products i don't actually know her age i don't know if she is reproducing that is just a funny comment but the other interesting part of the story is that apparently she just had a baby via surrogate and everybody was posting screenshots of those articles of like oh you just had a baby with a circuit saying things like this you dunked you can't talk about abortion because you did this i don't really see the connection totally i mean maybe it's like my body my choice but you're using somebody else's body like you don't want a baby so badly that you're gonna have some other woman do it i really don't know i don't care however she wants to have a child good for her i don't really agree with you on other things but it was just kind of an interesting correlation people were doing in the comments so she was not the only one katy perry then attempted to make herself relevant again and said baby your firework is a 10 but women in the u.s have fewer rights than an actual sparkler smh are you trying to compare sparklers to guns and then comparing guns via that to women the whole thing the whole tweet is just confusing and everybody in the comments like lost their mind thankfully somebody said you know what's cool you're free to complain about your government you're also free to vote organize protests and even run for office to create the change you desire by putting abortion to the states scotus put the issue much closer to voters than at the federal level exactly now i am pro-life but it astounds me the people that are pro-choice don't realize that if they actually stopped burning things down and getting good people elected whatever in accordance to their values they actually might have a chance i don't even know why i'm saying that because i don't want them to but that is what democracy is if you are you know if sending it back to the states that means that you have a chance to be represented at your state level somebody else said what does this even mean somebody replied and said women have less rights than guns the tweet ain't really that hard to comprehend yes it actually is it was written terribly also women do not have less rights than guns do i need to be concealed when i go out in public am i like not even allowed in some states do i need to be registered can do people have to have a background check before they can be friends with me no it's just like a stupid comparison this entire tweet is just stupid and i'm moving on because i hate it and katy perry you are irrelevant sorry lgbtq plus nation the publication also had some thoughts unsurprisingly they tweeted out and said feeling a little ambivalent about celebrating america this year give the national anthem a rest and celebrate the lgbtq nation instead and then posted an article and said the five lgbtq anthems that are spangled with way more than stars listen we just had pride what more do you want somebody commented and said they're just mad that the fourth of july doesn't include swinging your junk in a four-year-old's face for a dollar bill i would rather drag my testicles through shattered glass than dip them in a bowl of frank's red hot and somebody said i think i saw them doing that very thing i wanted their fried brains now obviously those tweets do not encompass every person that is in the lgbtq community and i know that but they are absolutely hysterical because the degeneracy that we saw at some of those praise and the drag queen stuff it's gross and it's inexcusable and people are just using those events as a way to rationalize their terrible gross behavior especially around children so no i'm done with that so let me have my hot dogs and my barbecue and my sparklers and my american flag and my freaking fireworks and just leave us all alone i really think that is what americans want right now we just want a weekend of quiet of gratitude of family time and of celebration and if people have their heads stuck so far up their ass that they cannot enjoy the simple pleasures of being an american i don't know what to tell you so i hope that you all ignored all of these crazy people and actually enjoyed your time because you know

just the irony is so beautiful", "izJZ1RVFZjI": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper now as you know the department of homeland security attempted to put together a misinformation board that would regulate thought basically be the thought police and there was going to be this crazy theatrical woman who was running it thankfully it got disbanded but as karine jean-pierre the new press secretary said the department of homeland security is not stopping its misinformation efforts the government still wants to you know combat harmful content even though the board has been disbanded and that you know whole idea really reaches into every aspect of society at this point especially on the left but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel and click that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode okay now this isn't technically government however it is a prime example of how the left views conservative media and conservatives having a presence on social media platforms and in big tech so we just need to watch this because it involves daily wire and it started trending yesterday it's just crazy you go to facebook on a daily basis the most the post with the most engagement are from dan shapiro or ben shapiro dan bongino candace owens it is right-wing content it dwarfs progressive content it dwarfs mainstream media accounting which is actually should be the part that scares us the most that ben shapiro's daily wire has more followers and engagement many times more than the new york times or cnn that is a problem for democracy we are literally triggering dan pfeiffer more than i could have ever imagined which is just delightful it's like that mean girls quote it's like why are you so obsessed with me like why do you have such beef with us dan what did we ever do to you but you know the only beef that i care about is good ranchers which is the place to get american raised beef chicken and seafood you guys know i love good ranchers they are one of my absolute favorite sponsors and right now i got a special deal for my audience you can get two free rib eyes which is over a hundred dollar value with free shipping when you place an order with good ranchers so go to goodranchers.com and use promo code cooper so you can get your two 18 ounce prime center cut rib eyes with free shipping complimentary with your order you do not want to miss out on this deal so go check them out now maybe if dan just ate some steak he would calm down dan use code cooper your life would be a lot better dude like stop being so triggered honestly the fact that ben shapiro that candice that the daily wire has more engagement more interactions more follows than msnbc and cnn new york times whatever is not just a problem for their agenda it's a it's a problem for democracy no you're just butt hurt but we have better content than yours and the people are waking up and they're realizing that you lie and you gaslight them about things work on your marketing and work on your content because something's not adding up and we are winning this guy is saying this while not realizing that what he is saying in that very moment is the reason why he is saying what he is saying in that very moment i'm sorry can you repeat that that comment hurt my head about as much as what uh dan pfeiffer said in that video oh a more clear comment somebody says so having multiple media choices is a problem for democracy got it no apparently just having your opposition's media doing better than yours is a problem for democracy because anything that they don't like it means that the fabric of our democracy is failing anything that they don't like is bigotry it's racism it's whatever it's never a them problem they never want to accept personal responsibility for the fact that they use you know logical fallacies every day that their content sucks that their arguments are not meaningful they don't want to accept any of that so you saw dan pfeiffer saying that this was a you know problem for democracy that the daily wire is doing better than him and obviously that's not really involving government yet but then he goes on to say that congress needs to regulate this misinformation you know um i've talked to a lot of former republican friends of of of mine and you know we're we sound like democrats now when we're around the table talking what do we do about but you know we always used to talk about how democrats would go we don't deserve good things okay you just take it yes it is yes it is there aren't enough no but there is a mindset if you're a republican and somebody spreads lies about you you go after them you you annihilate you politically you annihilate them you don't sit around and go oh my god it's just not right so you worked for political operation you worked for a white house that knew how to do it right what do you tell the people that are running both sides of pennsylvania avenue when i'm alone with them are going well they just lie what can we do well i think the the problem around this is getting worse every single day the the immediate the right wing media advantage this this this information propaganda operation is so much more powerful now than when i worked in the world it's getting bigger it's getting bigger flourishing yes and metastasizing metastasizing cancer that is a perfect metaphor for what we we're dealing with and it is i think what we have to do is radically rethink how we communicate everyone has a role to play here democrats have to be more aggressive we have to invest in building up our own megaphone to compete with republicans we need to we know that doesn't mean we build our own fox news it doesn't mean we run away from the mainstream media but we have to invest in progressive outlets i'm sorry you you need to build your own megaphone literally the left controls every mainstream institution you're worried about fox you guys have every other institution you have the education system you have hollywood you have freaking hollywood you don't need any other like traditional media if you have hollywood you have social media you have all the influencers you're worried about the right wing media propaganda machine you should be worried about us because we have common sense because our arguments are reaching people because people are realizing you are going so far left you're getting so radical and so extreme the people that are more you know traditionally liberal or you know centrist or moderate are saying oh my god i need something that's not this crazy and they're coming over to our side it's not because we control all of these media outlets we have all of the different megaphones no it's because we're based the media i think a lot of people may have to rethink how they deal with people who lie for a living and then the social media companies haven't have an obligation to do more we can't rely on them to do it on their own and so this is where congress and regulars have to step in to think about how we regulate these algorithms that are pushing this disinformation for profit that is one big pilot do you realize how terrifying that is the government already you know steps into every other aspect of our lives this is stepping over the bounds of free speech we already saw it at the world economic forum they were sitting around saying we need to like recalibrate what we think about like freedom of speech like what even is that do we need that yes we do that is the bedrock of democracy you guys are talking about you know democracy being eroded because the daily wire has a bunch of followers on facebook no it's being eroded because you want congress to regulate social media but he says congress has to step in and think about how we regulate anyone else think congress can fix anything yet they cannot everything that they touch turns to also dan if that is your real name we wouldn't even have this problem if the mainstream media would just tell the truth if y'all would just stop lying and stop gaslighting the american people we wouldn't be having to have this conversation now dan is talking about regulating this harmful content at the federal level because congress stepping in but it is also happening at the state level something just uh went through the pipeline yesterday in new york here is wonderful governor kathy talking about it and in the state of new york we're now requiring social media networks to monitor and report hateful conduct on their platforms thank you senator anna kaplan and thank you aside member patricia fahey so the government is requiring requiring social media platforms to report and monitor hateful conduct and this is all done under the guise of you know protecting new yorkers from gun violence making sure you know people that are posting threats that kind of thing get reported which is you know all good and well we do want to keep people safe but you know if you give the government that power they're not going to just stop at somebody making you know threats on their social media account but also we do not have specific enough definitions for what is hateful content or misinformation those words are intentionally vague so that these social media companies answer the government don't actually have to give us an explanation when they suspend an account when they demonetize somebody when they kick you off of a social media platform because oh it's just misinformation nobody actually knows what it is the entire system the entire precedent is absolutely dangerous and a total infringement upon the first amendment and they're convincing people that this is all good and well because they're using this inflammatory language and they're doing this all you know in the midst of these emergencies and these crises like we have to do it to protect people from gun violence so we have to do it because democracy is crumbling what the hell literally if you give them an inch they will take a mile and they will not care because you know what the government does not care about you and they are just

trans person um so first of all a lot of people are asking what treat I was using um if you don't know for service dogs when they do something that we like we click that behavior and then we give them a treat um I did not use it as a positive marker like that for my family because I'm not gonna treat them for basic human decency i instead used it as a negative marker so every time they said she I would click so that they would start to associate a click with a sheet in their head it would start to automatically self-correct I love that these people are now like identifying themselves as you know dogs and animals now they're treating everybody around them like a freaking pet this girl's account is disabled autistic lesbian somebody replied and said sure grotesque etc etc but if the family acquiesced this then sorry it's on them yes if I did anything remotely like that I would be kicked out of the house", "lRePjNZpGjI": "what's up guys welcome back to the comments section i'm brad cooper if you have not already make sure you are subscribed to this channel like this video and ring that little bell so that you never miss a comment section episode all right so i think it was yesterday my days all get mixed up but i was talking about the whole kim kardashian pete davidson kanye drama i did some updates i learned something utterly distressing and that is that kim is a libra i am also a libra and to full disclosure i really don't subscribe to the astrology crap i've never felt that it was too terribly accurate but every time that i tell somebody that i am a libra i get the same response and it's oh and so i thought we would dive into that today and so to help me unpack this i have my first ever guest on comment section i'm putting together a special team i have my producer i have sitting here kobe is the first person to ever sit in uh on comment section never sit on this beanbag but kobe is also a libra and you've also gotten the same response right yes i mean i believe in astrology when it says positive things about me when it's like libras are smart and hardworking and motivated i'm like yes i love astrology i believe in it yeah and then when they say any traits that are negative about libras i'm like this is all bold right well i thought we could start off by uh reading some tweets that i found about libras a libra has to be successful because they like expensive too much that's quite honest yeah it is um libra your insecurities are justified i don't like that one is that like a personal attack or something i'm seeing everyone talking about how so-and-so is the best zodiac sign but can we all agree that libras are the worst and why is there so much hatred around libras in your view i don't really know that's the thing nobody can ever give me an actual answer it's just a thing it's just like libra suck yes it's it's an assumption i think it's because we're so fantastic that nobody can be on our level everyone is stupid except me i pulled up a couple articles so that we could read just like a general overview if you're not you know familiar with astrology because really i'm not uh so this is from cosmo libra traits and personality explains very reliable sources oh obviously yes librans guess that's the what really is the plural maybe libras all right we're slick smart and charmers i'll take slick has a negative connotation smart though i'll take that okay uh tactful also could a negative connotation pleasing and diplomatic they can fit in any place anytime with anyone shape-shifting is almost a sport to libras and they enjoy mingling and socializing with different squads and crews you can find them lounging anywhere there you go being the center of attention and loved by all now that's true we're loved by all uh yeah and definitely uh being a social chameleon is the greatest advantage of being liberated i was gonna say yeah we can wiggle into any social situation it's but i also it's hard when you're kind of i am semi-awkward i think but i just kind of mask it and i'm like i'll you know weasel my way in here we love to think analyze ponder and dissect stuff love that we're using the word stuff in an article which makes them champion procrastinators too they'd love to take an objective viewpoint find the fair solution to any issue and enjoy learning new information they need mental stimulus that's all true see i found that procrastination is really just uh the most effective way for me to get work done because when you're in that crunch time you have to do it in that one hour period before it's due well then my brain is firing on all cylinders right just the way that they teed this whole thing up they're like yeah they're basically saying libras are slimy that's basically what they said in the first paragraph i feel like everything in my like personality type stuff is like you you're just hated across the board yeah i know every facet of you oh god i'm in a terrible situation i'm in a glass case of emotion diplomatic for shape shifters yeah uh a great listener also a bit of a gossip well i mean i do you think that's true about you well look at my show okay i do think that i'm a good listener i would say so away or upper or entitled we're often biased in our own favor okay well kobe has a funny story what did somebody call you the other day somebody said that i was confident bordering on arrogance bordering on here which is what prompted this whole segment actually is that then i found out that you were a libra yes and then i often get told that i'm like criminally overconfident yeah which i think is a positive thing yeah why is that bad well i like being confident is bad now apparently i'm triggering everybody huh but i go into any situation it's like i can figure it out it's fine like great you want me to think that intimidates other people so it's really it's probably jealousy is that why people hate libras it's jealousy okay segmented all right we figured it out figured out they hate us because they ain't us that's not what it is yes it is okay what are laborers into shopping no but there's too many things we're we like being in love we like meditating i can't meditate no i can't diy and cleaning i'm a stress cleaner overthinking yes that's true they could make it into the olympic team for overthinkers see but i feel like everyone in gen z will say that they overthink probably you know what i'm saying well then we just have an added level yeah i also have one of why libras are the worst the worst so this is where i start to disagree with astrology people hate libras because they're indecisive that's just apparently something across the board apparently you know people say like girls like when you ask them like if you're talking to your girlfriend and you're like where do you want to go to dinner or she decides it's like i don't really care like whatever that's a lie i'm like to the max really oh yeah it's like but but i genuinely so somebody says where do you want to go for dinner what do you say you say i don't care and i but the thing is i genuinely don't you really don't care i'll eat anything it's like you want yeah somebody want to take me to costco so when you say you don't care you mean it yes i was like i would like to do whatever you want to do is that normal i feel like most people when they say they don't care it's because they do care but they want the other person to decide no if i if i actually have somewhere that i want to go i'll be like no we're going to go there but oh okay so i will i will be up front but for the most part it's like no so you just speak your mind yes so you're just a libra yeah okay gosh yeah astrology is right man astrology is very accurate we shouldn't have done this i hate subscribing we can be self-pitying we're not exactly known for empathy i think i'm empathetic um but didn't you say you're not naturally empathetic okay all right okay uh we're most hated because we're unreliable that's a lie i think i'm reliable yeah you're reliable you're alive i'm reliable okay there we go all right astrology's wrong you're full levers can be as shallow as a kiddie pool that was all bs to be honest so i agree with all the positives about libras and i disagree with all the negatives and think they're wrong i need to show you this video she says dear libras libras hello it's you being superficial for me it's the controlling behavior for me it's the way you constantly constantly need validation for me you heard her okay so i was about to say she's clearly been hurt by a libra yeah somebody said dude what libra man broke your heart because this is not the move she literally just got dumped i feel like 100 like probably 30 minutes before this video was filmed see that's she got dumped by a libra you can't just put like these blanket assumptions on us we are nuanced complex individuals that cannot be boxed into an astrological box yeah exactly that's why everything that's negative about us is wrong yes but actually no look at this lady she's very credible just to share a few things that people don't know about libras you know they think we can't take her seriously with this scarf asymmetrical scarf i'm going to say we're almost the most sensitive sign on the zodiac didn't know that you thought it was the water signs also we are very emotional and sometimes we can hide the emotions and sometimes i did think it was the water science you knew enough about that no okay and it is my birthday today so i just wanted to share that with you and i'm carol star stanley bringing astrology down to earth and i think classical classic libra move always making it about herself i really like me here's the thing here's the whole thing with astrology is that you make generic statements that apply to anybody so she's like we take things personally libras take things personally it's like anybody listening to that would say oh yeah i take things personally because everyone takes some things personally you know so it's like like hurting our feelings hurts yeah that's in your name you're hurting somebody's feelings it's like we care hurting hurting our feelings is a big deal it's like but then we're such social chameleons that i feel like it doesn't it doesn't linger with me so those things seemingly contradict and i also think that going back to the prior video the whole notion of well uh p libras are manipulative but then she also said libras don't care yeah wait so if we don't care then why would we try to manipulate people to like in relationships presumably as the assumptions they hate us so much because we are so exceptional that they are using contradictory statements to diminish us yes that's unbelievable really so i feel like december we're a marginalized class we are i'm actually oppressed yeah is there a support group for libras there should be i'll start with there needs to be there'll be a new one you need to connect with all the libras in nashville unite them all oh god that would be the worst a libra convention in that shop it's all just like sociopaths trying to get to the top and nobody cares about it bunch of lips probably a bunch of lips yeah to sum this all up there was a nice comment on this video and someone says my opinion is that astrology is just space racism that's a weird meaning they're oppressing us this is discrimination based on factors that we cannot control well i'm glad that we've you know come to the conclusion that libras are the greatest astrological sign everybody around us is just jealous so thank you for that um and to affirm me and support me kobe has been here thank you so much for coming on the show course yes this is great you can be my wingman anytime this is

another sport has bit the dust and become cucked by a political agenda today we are talking about hockey but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection keep your eyes peeled because Black Friday is coming up you might see some cool deals on merch you might see some cool deals on daily wire memberships stay tuned today is basically the NHL's funeral hockey's funeral in a way because yesterday just a mere 24 hours ago they posted this tweet the NHL is proud to support this past weekend's team trans draft tournament in Middleton Wisconsin this was the first tournament comprised entirely of transgender and non-binary players with around 80 folks participating yay hashtag hockey is for everyone hashtag NHL Pride wow so inclusive of so cute so fun it's basically just a bunch of confused men and women skating around and hitting those pucks together but that's fine in my opinion I didn't have a problem with this original tweet because everybody has been advocating for Trans people to have their own League don't compete against the other biological genders just compete amongst yourselves I'm not saying you can't play sports that would be incredibly rude of me this is fine here are some pictures of them in their pink and purple and blue and white outfits because of course you have to rep the trans flag at all times here they are here's some ponytails those must be some men women no idea here there there's some signs we love team trans yay intersectionality oh look they're uh they're hockey sticks even have the trans flag oh good for them again good for them I was fine I was gonna move on but then somebody had legal to ask a simple question and they said so it's Men playing against women and all hell broke loose the NHL responded to this tweet from code and said trans women are women trans men or men non-binary identity is real that literally does not even answer the question you were just waiting for an opportunity to spew that nonsense everywhere I mean I guess you're just confirming the answer by saying that like men and women are playing against each other but you're doing that by just screaming some political nonsense and immediately which I love they started getting ratio somebody replied and said the new NHL locker room and it is a bunch of dudes in uh lingerie and nightgowns negliges ping at a urinal somebody else said a fire Twitter employee just got a new job as the head of social media for the NHL someone else said that I'm sure you'll start drafting trans men onto the men's hockey team if you don't you're a bigoted homophobic am I right there were so many people pointing out just the absolute monstrosity that would be biological women playing hockey against biological men like that would be a bloodbath I think that I am a pretty you know empowered woman I like you know being adventurous that sort of thing I would never absolutely never do that never I have you you've seen the teeth on those hockey players yet no you have not because I don't have any because they all get knocked out no woman wants to be doing that against a bunch of men somebody else said proud to stop watching hockey me too even though I never watched in the beginning no I don't really care I like the preds it's a good time somebody posted this and said the gender Spectrum male female and everything in between is just mental illness maybe I'm crazy but shouldn't the NHL be focusing on hockey and not science and politics like stop compromising your values and the things you are supposed to be doing for some sort of weird political gain you know who would never do that good ranchers good ranchers is a 100 American brand through and through and they stick with what they do best producing meat and this holiday season they want to make sure that you are saving money as you're stocking up your freezer because due to a shrinking cattle herd beef prices are expected to rise 15 in 2023 and that is not even counting for inflation so today's prices which are already expensive are going to seem cheap in the next few months and good ranchers wants to mitigate that for you as these costs continue to rise they will inflation-proof your grocery bill by locking

goodranchors.com code Cooper at checkout you can rest easy knowing that you are eating delicious food you're saving money and you are supporting a brand that will never bend a knee unlike the NHL I think that their feelings got a bit hurt so they did what every cucked account does and they turned off their comments you can see who can reply only people the NHL follows or mentions can reply so fun thankfully though that did not stop people people just kept quote tweeting them somebody said this is offensive to everyone who believes in science really stupid for the NHL to wade into this agreed somebody else said the NHL is now a biologist so excited for this new uh career Venture for them this is really really fascinating to watch per usual of course there was people that came to their defense this person said the NHL desperately trying to grow the game after Decades of pandering to the most bigoted group of people and then having to figure out how to deal with the bigoted culture they created I didn't know that hockey had a bigoted culture is hockey some like conservative sport that I just didn't know about scheller is it dominated by like Republicans oh pull it up Jamie shelter and I were just talking about this and apparently 97 of the NHL is white and then the other three percent is made up of other ethnicities and of that three percent 26 of those players are black so definitely there's some white supremacist accusations mixed up in here I'm sure people hate this it's some like rich white sport I have no idea it also just feels like toxically male probably because they're rhyming into each other and slamming each other's teeth out I mean you could say this in for football I guess but anyway I'm sure that they will blame this on like white supremacy and capitalism and toxic masculinity therefore hockey is a bigoted sport I also think it's funny that she used this photo from El Arroyo if you guys don't know what El Arroyo is it's this

based restaurant that always makes fun of fall editions in Biden I don't think you're having the dunk that you think you are somebody else said anyone being transphobic in the comments deserves nothing but the worst y'all are truly such sad people I'm so sorry this is happening to you I don't think any of us are actually sad over here we're just pointing out the fact that this is not biological that the situation is absurd like why on this random November day in 2022 did the NHL did hockey in general decide to go out and be political I have never talked about hockey before I personally have never seen them be political I feel like maybe they've always stayed Above The Fray I talk about football and basketball a ton why couldn't you just let people enjoy your sport without

into the story make sure that you like this video if you are not subscribed to this channel already i hope that this video earns your subscription and then ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode we are at 820 000 subscribers now which is wild because we only hit 700k uh on july 4th a million is coming sooner than i can really wrap my head around definitely feel a little imposter syndrome but i'm so happy that you guys are here i love doing this show so let's keep it going apparently there is something called the espys and the espys were this week to be honest did not even know that they were a thing and apparently i'm not the only person online that could care less or was not interested jason i just randomly saw this tweet he posted this and said what would you rather do than watch the espys they said be waterboarded walk on hot coals chew glass or drink two week old expired milk so clearly before even diving into what the espys are i knew i was in for a treat now i know you guys are gonna make fun of me for how i describe this because i'm sure there are nuances that i'm missing but for the people in the room that like me just need a baseline you know explanation of what the espys are they are a sports award show they used to be hosted by espn now they are hosted by abc which basically are the same thing because they are both owned by disney anyway sports awards show steph curry hosted this year and you know i love him i do like the warriors i've i saw steph curry play for the first time when he was a sophomore in college god love him he is so awkward he and the general consensus online was that his writers failed him and that all of his jokes were dry and so just to give you a taste of what this show was here's his opener slash lebron james roast also it's very clear steph was a little toasted just saying he's even holding the drink in his hands so he's was not even being sly i am the second nba player to host this awards show which is kind of crazy to think about lebron james he hosted the this awards show back in 2007 after losing in the nba finals so yes uh you guessed it this uh this feels better this feels better ab wow i'm rolling on the floor laughing so hysterical just the energy in the room is just wild also you can clearly hear the laugh track that was not all though he did another part of the roast it's just inspiring to see that strategy of you know buying old superstars for a local team around here you know hey but tombow where'd my tombow i heard you're looking for a 10 day yes or no no no no hit up raw police let him know all right oh brother this guy stinks like i'm so sorry like steph i love you but that was so cringe that feels like a drunk guy just got broken up with stumbled into a random open mic night and got on stage just maybe 2 am and there's nobody in the crowd and he's like this is my shot man because i'm so drunk i don't even care am i wrong no that literally he's not even projecting he has no energy somebody said oh the bronze sexuals aren't gonna like this that's actually a very funny name and i had not heard that before today but i do appreciate that because listen the lebron fandom it is both deep when it comes to sports and politics like these people think that the man is a king i think that he is an idiot to be quite honest based somebody said bruh steph is not funny this is painful we finally found something he's not good at and i mean yes like he's he is an amazing player he seems like a great dad he comes from a good family he seems very intelligent guys he finally graduated from davidson last year because he left to go pro until he never graduated i mean he just seems like an all-around good guy not everybody can be good at comedy i could not do stand-up comedy so it's fine we still love you but that was genuinely terrible the ones that unfortunately this is one of the weakest sp openings of all time first who wrote this crap for steph damn i can write material a thousand times better there's so much work to do the producers miss the damn boat and who's deaf stylist black elevator shoes with a lime suit it really does look like he got his top half from bruno mars and then got the boots from kanye and was like this'll do this is fine it was not somebody said y'all had months of preparation with all types of writers and resources and this is what you gave curry who is that holy leave comedy to the comedians yeah listen they aren't even funny these days which is depressing so maybe this is just kind of the baseline of what we can expect you know i guess have you seen the woke netflix specials they make me cry not laugh and not in a good way i love i love angry white man comedy oh so funny it's hilarious you stink now obviously because it is an award show there was woke virtue signaling soccer player megan rapinoe it makes me want to bang my head into a wall she also just won a medal of freedom which is horrifying she preached to everyone per usual they talked about russia and ukraine of course and then they shield for china literally the young woman who won the breakthrough athlete of the year award was the skier eileen goo who made waves when she renounced her american citizenship to go compete for china and the sb goes to who are these people eileen good [Applause] [Music] i will say her outfit is dope now apparently she gave a speech and she talked about you know her mom being so inspiring and you know her mom's from china and so she talked about you know her family her culture it seemed like a nice speech he ended it in chinese don't really have a problem with that but i do have a problem with the fact that somebody that walked away from this country did get the award i mean literally how obvious can espn and abcb like they are owned by disney and we all know that china has disney by the balls china has most big corporations and companies buy the balls but you know they don't have a hold on nimmy skincare nimmy's skincare is 100 american made and they even source some of their ingredients from local american farms they stand against cancel culture and wokeness and they give some of their profits back to organizations with strong american values and even better than that is their products are actually amazing and they work so you can buy with a clear conscience and a clear skin i've been using their products since january i have their daily glow-up routine it is absolutely fantastic and it keeps my skin hydrated and strong even after getting a terrible sunburn like i did in florida i am definitely peeling right now but their moisturizing cream has been saving my rudolph nose if you want to check out nimmy skin care go to nimmyskincare.com use promo code cooper at checkout for 15 off of your order you will not regret it because guys more than ever we need companies that are not bought out by china there was some debate over how eileen goo was able to compete for china because she consistently and very terribly avoided the questions reporters would say like how did this actually happen and she would awkwardly kind of sit there and go oh well i'm just like so grateful to be here and then she would go off in chinese and talk about something else like it was very obvious something fishy had happened because according to the olympic committee you must be a citizen of a country in order to compete for that country and eileen goo's mom is chinese so that would usually give you the pathway for having dual citizenship but china does not allow dual citizenship so people have been up in arms trying to figure out her workaround literally since the olympics happened and either way i do believe the people are rightfully upset with her because she walked away from her country and instead she supported and made tens of millions of dollars off of an oppressive communist government like it was financially more advantageous for her to go and get chinese sponsorships with chinese brands and the chinese government all of those subsidies then compete for america and yes she is an exceptionally talented athlete i'm not taking away from how fantastic she is i mean just watch her ski it is beautiful and she is clearly some kind of prodigy she was the youngest uh olympic champion when it comes to skiing but there are countless others that chose to be here that chose to represent our country that did not walk away because there was more money or more whatever like i guarantee giving her this award that all of this was some kind of political choice and it's gross because we still like to think that we are you know this huge strong country the strongest country in the world but just like disney we are pretty cooked by china we owe them billions and they know that our government is weak they know that the west is falling in front of their eyes i mean like look at all the comments online where people are going what's going on in america like you guys are literally crazy yeah china knows and it's only getting worse do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure

Indonesia yeah they had us the first half I'm not gonna lie well actually sex before marriage is banned in Indonesia and people on the internet are very riled up about it because I think everybody was trying to plan trips to Bali in Indonesia I guess and now they are feeling a bit conflicted about that but anyway before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this

first saw this through a post from Daily Loud they said Indonesia has banned sex outside out of marriage and banned unmarried couples from living together these laws apply to both citizens and foreigners tourists those convicted will face up to one year in jail so then I thought this is is this a joke what is this I never even heard of Daily Loud somebody just retweeted it so it popped up on my feed but this is from Fox News they said on Tuesday Indonesia's Parliament approved a new criminal code Banning sex outside of marriage which carries a punishment for up to one year in jail the new code passed with support from all political parties also prohibits cohabitation between unmarried couples the code will apply to Indonesians and foreigners and comes despite concerns that the laws could keep tourists away and harm Investments the country already bans adultery but had not done the same for premarital sex Melana yusron Deputy Chief of Indonesia's tourism industry board said that the new code was quote totally counterproductive during a time when the country's economy and tourism was just beginning to recover from the coronavirus pandemic quote we deeply regret how the government has closed their eyes we have already expressed our concern to the ministry of Tourism about how harmful this law is he said the tourism factor is actually very surprising to me because like everybody and their mother wants to go to Bali for like a vacation honeymoon whatever so guys when you are planning your next romantic getaway to Bali don't be thinking you can run around naked on the beaches of Indonesia like make sure you are packing some pajamas so you stay fully clothed I actually have some great pajamas for you here from pajama gram this is actually the perfect opportunity for me to announce my new partnership with this brand now a couple of weeks ago Pajamagram sent me a bunch of items from their new naturally nude line and I just have to own up to something guys because in a recent video where I was talking about Christmas gifts I definitely threw shade at people who wear like pajama sets because I I was like I just wear like a big t-shirt like why give people pajamas I am happy to say that I will throw that statement out the window I love these naturally nude pajamas they are available exclusively at Pajamagram they are easily the most

pajamas that is pajamagram.com for these incredible silky smooth pants that you will need to keep on when you are visiting Bali so it does seem a bit weird but you know what I don't really care they're doing what feels right for their culture so you know not up to me to decide but the US ambassador to Indonesia Sun Kim said criminalizing the personal decisions of individuals would Loom large with the decision Matrix of many companies determining whether to invest in Indonesia the code is part of several new laws that critics say imposes on civil liberties along with bans on black magic insulting the president or state institutions spreading views counter to state ideology and staging protests without notification basically what Parliament is doing in Indonesia is just coming down hard on you know legislating what they see as their moral code their moral compass and you know what for their country that is totally fine I saw this on daily lab like I said and I was kind of tentatively scrolling down but I was shocked that the two top replies that I saw were these good to see some countries still being serious about culture and tradition another comment read unpopular opinion but this is a good law we need this in the U.S there will be less one parent households like I did not even have to scroll more than two fingers to see those two top comments I mean I was shocked obviously there were responses like this too somebody said buying my ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend flights to Indonesia somebody else that I can't believe they made the horny jail into a real thing it really is just good for my own entertainment and enjoyment but then I saw comments on like the Fox News article in the New York Times article where people were really getting riled up about it it was all like privileged Americans being like how could they how could they do this this backwards country this is just a glimpse of what rule under Christian nationalism would look like in this country back to the Middle Ages somebody else said Singapore is the same way as if that stopped me like okay good for you dude I guess but what always shocks me is the people in the west think that we are so high and mighty we are so developed we are so Progressive and they look down upon the rest of the world that is much more traditional this is not an abnormal Law Michael Knowles actually just did a debate with an abortion activist but they got into many other issues and cultural issues and one of which was talking about you know the culture surrounding sex and then the woman brought up like well do you think you would just ban sex like you could never do that and Michael was like no in like half of the other countries in the world like pre-marital sex is banned anal sex is bad even in some states here like it's a pretty normal thing outside of our culture and she was like I just don't believe that it just goes to show how this connected we are and it's kind of laughable in a way I mean we talked about that with the World Cup happening in Qatar and all of these you know privileged Americans coming in being like I'm gonna disrespect all of your whatever it's just a normal thing I guess anyway obviously this is a very nuanced issue I think hookup culture is disastrous for society and our physical and mental well-being I've also heard the studies about divorce rates when you live together before marriage versus not I think it's fascinating but like do I care whether you do that no do I care whether you have sex before marriage obviously not do I want to stop people from doing that not really it's your life I do not care well Live and Let Live I say but if this works for Indonesian culture that's totally fine like the Western world does not need to come in with some like quote this is very woke of me like white savior Western savior complex to free these people from their oppressive whatever no we're just kind of like degenerates just saying and you know not every country and culture has the same opinions and values when it comes to sex and how that relates to free freedom and personal choice and that sort of thing and you know what that's totally fine like we can all Let It Go thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this channel turn on your

assume that you asked this question in a way that you really want to learn so i will explain all the ways that it is okay let's say that you're attracted to women well if you're attracted to a woman then you're attracted to sex women trans women without bottom surgery and trans women with bottom surgery if you're attracted to um vj then you can be attracted to a cis woman at trans men without bottom surgery a trans woman with bottom surgery or a non-binary person which depending on their assigned gender at birth having or not having had the surgery but it is that exclusion that makes it transphobic i've said it before but i immediately knew it was going to come out of this person's mouth the moment that i looked at them i also knew that it was not going to be a coherent argument and that my brain was going to be melting and it did nobody said i don't like imitation crab meat i can taste the difference yeah yeah yeah that's yeah accurate", "ABbh-u6txPk": "okay let's talk about the green line test i'm gonna explain it it essentially is showing who is pulling who in a relationship like who wears the pants uh it shows whose access is straight and whose is being pulled in this test can be done on anybody um as we could see here harry is leaning in megan is straight every photo he passes the green light test look at she's trying to pull him into her axis and he says no no no will and jada you can see the green lines right now i don't even have to draw them for you you're seeing them already and guess who passed the green line test oh no the man that jada slept with when she

all right ma'am we'll come back to you daddy sugar daddy one would think that the fact that this woman was trying to get out of jury duty would be the focal point of this video no no every comment is about the judge back to the real story who is this judge your honor can get it i need the judge to be my sugar mom", "f516sIj2yxY": "I just took my kids to the dentist and I'm sitting there filling out all the paperwork which for all my kids it's a lot and on the relationship to patient I'm putting parent for each and every one and after I'm done I give a huge stack like this thick I'm not even kidding because I have a lot of kids papers to the assistant and they're looking through it and then say well can you just write Mom on the paper and I said I'm non-binary I don't use Mom I'm a parent that's what I call myself she literally rolled her eyes at me what is this world that we live in why is this so complicated I [Music] I hate it here look all it's only ridiculous because you are ridiculous I love that that woman rolled her eyes and walked away as she should I really want to know what your children call you do they call you parent parent come here it's freaking weird somebody said why is it so complicated because you make it complicated dingbat she just rolled her eyes and walked off I would too yes based absolutely", "XcR9uZA3pos": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brad cooper do you guys remember leah william thomas the trans swimmer that absolutely dominated the ncaa swimming finals just a couple of months ago we talked about it a lot it was hot in the news well leah is back william leah did a six-minute interview with good morning america talking about thomas's experience of being a trans swimmer and facing all of the hate from people all of that and it's kind of perfect timing that thomas just did this interview and that had just aired because matt walsh's new documentary what is a woman premieres tonight exclusively on daily wire at 8 p.m eastern time there's a backstage live right before it it is truly i think the best piece of content that we have ever put out it is absolutely exceptional welsh knocked it out of the park it's incredible so get ready to watch it and it's really just perfect timing because walsh actually interviewed one of thomas's teammates and it's just you know brings us full circle back to this conversation of what does leah thomas actually think he is when he's calling himself a woman we don't really know and walsh is going to help us figure that out but before we get into all of this make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section segment all right let's just go ahead and dive into this i was going to pull specific clips to talk about but the whole thing is just so good so we're going to run through it let's do it she's the swimmer who created shockwaves across the country 23-year-old leah thomas is pulling away he's not only a man but he's also older than everybody else too throughout the controversy thomas has largely remained quiet until now i knew there would be scrutiny against me if i uh competed as a woman i was prepared for that but i also don't need anybody's permission to be um myself and to to do the sport that i love you're gonna see a common thread in this interview and that it's all about how thomas feels and all of that nothing scientific nothing about the feelings of other ones it's just like well i'm i'm okay it's like great so so happy about that no you don't need anybody's permission unless you are a minor you can do whatever you want but it doesn't stop the fact that it is unfair and that you literally have a scientific advantage thomas began hrt hormone replacement therapy in may of her sophomore year 2019. the mental and emotional changes actually happened very quickly i was feeling a lot better mentally i was i was less depressed and i lost muscle mass and i became a lot weaker and a lot a lot slower in the water still faster than a girl though her critics say she jumped in the rankings between the men's and the women's team there are some who look at the data and suggest that you're enjoying a competitive advantage what do you say to that there's a lot of factors that go into a race and how how well you do and the biggest change for me is that i'm happy you were asked if you have a scientific physical advantage over the women that you're competing with who are two heads shorter than you and you say no no the biggest change is that i'm happy is you being happy making you a fast swimmer i'm a very happy peppy person most of the time i can't swim that fast you've seen me do butterfly oh i'm like a flopping dead fish in the ocean it's so bad but i'm happy just keep swimming just keep swimming no that's a cop-out once again it's incredibly selfish and just saying oh i just don't care because my emotions are more important than truth that's kind of like the quintessential thing on the left to be honest their truth more important than objective truth trans people don't transition for athletics we transition to be happy and authentic and our true selves transitioning to get an advantage is not something that ever factors in to our decisions you didn't transition to win more medals no i don't think that thomas transitioned just so that he could win i think that's a bit outlandish maybe it could have been a small contributing factor but i genuinely think there are you know mental cultural social problems that are at the root of all of this as there are with everything in the transgender craze it's fine if that was not a primary motivator of his you know transitioning over but it is still a result of his transition which he probably hasn't fully transitioned just look at what he looks like in that bathing suit i don't like where this is going the meat is still there and i'm sorry that's kind of grotesque and graphic so you know if we if we want to talk about a different kind of meat we should be talking about good ranchers good ranchers is your go-to supplier of beef chicken and seafood they have rib eyes t-bones chicken and salmon and more their beef earns the highest usda rating and their chicken is pasteurized with no antibiotics it is better than organic i love good ranchers i rely on them you guys should too especially because inflation is raging we can't even get meat on our shelves right now so just know that when you buy a good rancher subscription box your price gets locked in so it doesn't matter what biden and all of these other crazy people are doing the cost of your meat will stay the same if you want to try them out go to goodranchers.com and use code cooper which will get you two free 18 ounce prime center cut rib eyes with your order that's a hundred dollar value so go check them out back to something that is far less exciting even if you did not transition for that purpose that is the unintended consequence of your actions so you need to deal with them lightning rod 16 of her own teammates and some of their parents wrote anonymous letters arguing thomas posed a threat to women's sports the women who i'm sorry just look at that picture i don't have an advantage towering over a woman even if you lost muscle mass even if you were not able to swim as fast as you were as a biological man because you did have hormone therapy changes i'm sure that that happens because when you do that hormone replacement or you do puberty blockers your body gets royally effed up it completely changes i'm not saying that it does not but you cannot change the fact that you are literally a head taller than these girls and your wingspan is probably taller than them i mean guys like five years ago this would have been something that we would have seen on the onion and now the onion is just like an arm of left wing propaganda but five years ago like this tiny reporter and this huge female swimmer give me a break okay we're not done yet i'm sorry that we're not but we're not they absolutely supported your right to transition but they simply think it's unfair for you to compete against cisgender women you can't go halfway and be like i support trans women and trans people but only only to a certain point where if you support trans women as women and they've met all the all the ncaa requirements then i don't know if you can really say something like that trans women are not a threat to women's sports while the science on transgender athletes is new and evolving some medical experts say the effects of higher testosterone during male puberty may never be fully erased what are the physical aspects that trans women may not be able to roll back with hormone therapy obviously issues related to body size airway size hand size foot size perhaps bone density and so forth that's literally all of it if we're talking about sports hand size wingspan height bone density foot size i'm gonna cry how does this reporter sit here nodding her head seriously going oh yeah yeah but that doesn't take an impact because the hormones and some of the muscle mass my brother is 6'3 and he's a string bean i love him to death he's a string bean purely because he is 6'4 and because of things that are different biologically in his body even though i probably have more muscle than he does and that's saying something because noodle arm he can lift and do more than i can science are you saying that years of hormone therapy cannot put trans women in place to compete with cisgender women i think that evidence so far would suggest that period of a year two years three years four years is probably insufficient there is this concept of the legacy effects of testosterone and that that can't ever be zero should that eliminate or disqualify transgender women i'm not a medical expert but i'm not a biologist hey i've seen this one i've seen this one this is a classic there's cis women who are very tall and very muscular and have more testosterone than another cis women and should that then also disqualify them in january the ncaa updated its transgender athlete eligibility guidelines saying each sports governing body could make their own rules later clarifying it wouldn't impose the new rules mid-season clearing the way for thomas to compete at the ncaa's it was an incredible experience to be able to fulfill that personal goal and be at that meet um as well as competing as my authentic self was just such an amazing my authentic self these things i've been working towards for so long all come come together are there olympics in your future it's been a goal of mine to just film at olympic trials for a very long time and i i would love to see that through okay well what i want to see is michael phelps versus leah thomas like phelps is a master but also that feels like it would be a more adequate matchup than leah thomas versus like a 5 6 sophomore swimmer at penn is that like how is that a controversial statement the fact that that is is absolutely insane this comment made me laugh it's unfair as hell but i can't wait until the first mma trans woman has their first fight that's going to be interesting yeah you're not wrong you have a physical advantage in this case because you transitioned maybe that wasn't the intent but it's the result that is a fact exactly it is the unintended consequence if truly you did not transition for this purpose it does not matter good for you live your best life live your authentic self but still there are consequences of your actions and you cannot expect everybody else to put their lives aside to roll over to make space for you that is not how the world works even though the left wants us to think that it's not be trans or whatever but don't take away the spirit of competition so you feel good about yourself it's leah thomas's world and we're all just living in it yeah at this point it feels like it's every oppressed person's world and we're just living in it this person was not a fan of the criticism and said testosterone is the swimming hormone cis women just drown if they come in contact with water conservatives talk about leah thomas using logic that hasn't been updated since the medieval witch trials what logic that cis women can't swim what is that like i don't even understand the point that you're trying to make this is the most obnoxious thing i've ever experienced in my life this is not a witch hunt this is literally just trying to level the playing field i thought y'all were all about equality but really it's not that it's equity and getting those confused is a terrible mistake what was referenced in that video was the mayo clinic doctor talking about how you know one to three years is not a sufficient amount of time in order to level this playing field that's part of a report that was dropped a couple of days before this good morning america and it says that the mayo clinic doctors confirm trans swimmer leah thomas does have an unfair advantage even after taking testosterone supplements testosterone is the 800 pound gorilla which gives biological men an advantage it's great that this came out i'm glad that it is out in the open it's what we've been saying for months now but the fact that mayo clinic doctors literally had to do a study and do a report on whether this was unfair it's pretty indicative of the times that we're living in it's like no this is this is common sense i don't need you to spend money doing a study or report on it i think we know if you guys don't know who blaire white is uh blair white is a transgender woman transitioned at a much younger age but is a very common sense voice on the trans issue talks a lot about the advantages that biological men have over women has been on joe rogan a ton of other podcasts it's just a really fascinating voice and really crosses party lines in a way that not a lot of people can blair said a doctor has confirmed that transformer leah thomas has an advantage over women in sports also breaking ducks can indeed quack exactly it's a pretty good way to sum it up all of this is just absolutely ridiculous i didn't learn anything from watching this other than leah thomas feels happy and that is what is making leah swim faster so apparently i just need to get happy and then i'm going to qualify for the olympics do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're

would prefer to be used because they're seven so they don't really know what pronouns are and we want to help unders everybody understand um what it means to be non-binary and like what the options are your child thinks that they're non-binary but they don't even know pronouns no you know what that means that you suggested that they might be non-binary and they're latching on to it because you are their parent so they're going to listen to what you have to say i think social media really makes people strive for attention these people aren't doing it for their child i think they're really harming their kids they're doing it so that they can get attention and validation from strangers it's like munchausen by proxy yes what else is there to say somebody said we've had it too easy in western society that's why we're tearing it apart from the inside with this nonsense yes people didn't have enough to complain about so they're causing their own problems and harming children",

school year they proceeded to tell me that they had a psychiatrist come to the school and give my kid antidepressants and he's been on them for several months i had no knowledge i knew nothing about

about everyone's least favorite leftist activist organizer whatever he wants to call himself David Hogg you know him you probably don't love him David Hogg is a survivor of the tragic Parkland shooting that happened in February of 2018. he came out of that experience and became a rabid Second Amendment hater and began fighting against it which is why he started March for our lives that has basically snowballed over the last few years into just being a general leftist activist he has barged into Senate hearings spoken in front of Congress trolled basically everyone pissed everybody off and Hog's whole personality online is basically a young man who's very arrogant trying to seem very smart and he tweets all of these things that I'm sure he thinks are very philosophical and intelligent but when you read them they just kind of come across as glorified shower thoughts did you know we spend all of our time watching the time most of the time but what happens when we run out of time [Music] this is what we're going to be diving into today get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection hog made this thread on September 18th so a few days ago and the ramifications of it are still spiraling on social media but he started with this kids are the new boats pets are the new kids plants are the new pets let me explain like yes kids are nice but most people can't afford them so it's nice to have friends with one but not have one yourself pets are the affordable version of kids today for Millennials and gen Z and plants are now the more affordable plants which I think he meant to say the more affordable pets it's kind of written a little wonky but whatever we get the point is it like the number of people I know who literally throw big actual birthday parties for their dogs that they have friends invited to and everything is awesome it's just kind of weird but also very telling of our changing view of having children in our economic condition like me I'm never planning on having kids I would much rather own a Porsche and have a portrait water dog and a golden doodle long term it's cheaper better for the environment and will never tell you that it hates you or ask you to pay for college but that's just me I would love to help watch my friend's kids in the future though and be the fun Uncle friend that helps teach them to skateboard and Surf and stuff also a big reason I will never have kids in the U.S I refuse to race kids in a country that values Guns Over children's lives I know far too many parents who have had their kids killed by gun violence no one should ever feel that kind of pain ever well now I want a Portuguese Water Dog God damn it thanks Twitter to be clear I'm not telling you what you should or should not do deciding to have children is not your choice I am just expressing my own view on it again like philosophical poetry it's just comical to me how people believe that having a dog or a cat is the equivalent of having a child it's so totally different that that does not the comparison is not there at all all these Millennials are like Oh I'm a dog Mom I don't need kids I'm a dog mom no shut up your little Chihuahua is not your child sorry I'm probably gonna trigger people with that I've only had Arlo for a day and a half but if anything happened to him I would kill everyone in this room and then myself I love that we are just boiling down children to being awful leeches that hate you and just ask you for things the terrible twos and teenagers can probably be no fun I however was perfect because I had to stick up my ass thank you very much true fact I only got grounded once um that does not make me sound cool at all I'm very sorry but anyway it's just kind of depressing that that is how we think of children these days first of all all of the grammar in these tweets was absolutely awful and it made it very very difficult to read you're making my job very hard David Hogg he is correct in that last tweet it is the individual's choice but right now two entire Generations Millennials and gen Z are being told that having children is detrimental to the environment and is detrimental to their own happiness that your life is over when you have a child that's why people desperately want the option to have an abortion because if you get pregnant oh my world is over I have no life anymore that is a depressing and awful way to think they've also been convinced that the world is ending and our country has gone to so there is no reason to raise children because we will have nothing to leave them you are never going to do any good work to try to fix our current situation or to better yourselves or your community if you think that there is no hope and you don't even want to try to leave something good for another generation you're basically wanting the cycle to end with you number one that's just selfish number two it's just stupid so yes David Hall you were right it is your choice it is every individual's Choice whether or not they want to have kids or not but we have to change the conversation around this I'm just sitting here thinking about the future that David Hogg has painted for us for his life and I'm just thinking about him at 40 years old living alone in a house childless he has a Porsche sitting outside that he's definitely leased he has his Portuguese water dogs running around the house his golden doodle and he's probably sitting there eating vegan meat because he thinks that real meat is bad for the environment even though we all know that is totally not true thanks to good ranchers as you all know good ranchers is my very favorite meat delivery service and not only are their products absolutely incredible they have incredible values and their meat is of the highest quality they add no hormones no antibiotics it is all so fresh which means that it not only nourishes us but it also nourishes the environment because unlike environmentalists want you to believe natural practices are actually good for the Earth so when you order from good ranchers you can know that you are actually doing something positive for the environment without having to eat bugs or tofu or beyond meat so if you want to try them out go to goodranchers.com Cooper and use promo code Cooper at checkout for 30 off of your order plus free shipping again that is goodranchors.com Cooper promo code Cooper at checkout this meat is just too rich for David I feel like I think if you try to eat it he would literally topple over because he's genuinely a string bean I think that Hogg assumed that people were just going to agree with him on this because so many people who are gen Z and Millennials like I said do not want to have kids and they sort of supported him on it but not in the way that you would think somebody replied and said this is wonderful news never waver from this belief the world will be better off if he does not have a child another person said thank you Jesus this is all under the one where he said he never wants to have kids another person said you not procreating is a win for all I do feel sorry for those dogs though his freaking golden doodle gold Doodles are such a meme white girl and her new fiance has a golden doodle and listen I can't really talk because I have a labradoodle and then I also have a like Terrier Poodle mix I am like fully immersed in the doodle world but even I could admit from the inside they are kind of cliche dogs but it makes sense because they are well-mannered they are easy to groom they're usually hypoallergenic like I get it but also it's so basic David Hogg somebody else says we all fully support your not having kids might I suggest an early vasectomy to ensure that you remain childless good God that's funny but it's also very accurate these days because vasectomies have literally skyrocketed since the overturning of Roe v Wade so many of these guys think that this is basically just male birth control and it's totally reversible and they can have children in 10 or 15 years no you can't you can reverse a vasectomy in the first five years and have a pretty good shot at having children but as the years go on the chance for you to reverse that and actually be able to procreate it gets Slimmer and Slimmer and Slimmer you are literally sterilizing yourself that is not birth control all of these young men cutting themselves off what happens in 20 years in 15 years and 10 years where you meet an incredible woman and you want to start a family what then they are literally allowing this nihilistic doomsday attitude to prevent them from having options and maybe actually having a fulfilling life with a family it really is depressing back to the roasting which is what I actually care about somebody said every time David Hogg tweets the Asian guy he beat out of Harvard cries oh that's just depressing things have really gone downhill so Raj tweeted out and said David Hogg welcome to the international Society of incels and sips better known as Isis oh you can't keep getting away with this I'm never planning on having kids well obviously that would require finding a woman who will have sex with you please go on for Miles I'm not kidding This Thread does not end it's all these people being like okay well that's depressing but also thank you for not procreating it's kind of sad but then Ben Shapiro jumps in [Music] quote tweets hog and says based on the massive success of your pillow company I'm going to say that the Porsche may be Out Of Reach how does a 2004 Kia Optima sound if you didn't know David Hogg wanted to start a pillow company to compete with Mike lindell's my pillow Mike Lindell is the very outspoken conservative he's friends with Trump basically every conservative and their mother has my pillow pillow I definitely do David Hogg wanted to compete with that and started his own pillow company it absolutely tanked God awful like I don't know where he's getting his money from probably some Progressive sponsorships or something like that hog did not like that because he hates Ben Shapiro and he basically spent the next 24 hours firing off awful tweets he said I'm not so mad that he came after me as I am that he gets why does this man literally not know how to write I am not so mad that he came after me as I am that he is radicalizing young men into believing that they are oppressed by women simply because they can't get laid he would do a lot better for the world if he did a video for his followers on how to shower and wash their sheets what you're not even being Sly you're not even trying to hide the fact that you have obviously never listened to Ben Shapiro speak for more than two seconds you're basically insinuating that everybody who listens to Ben is some basement dwelling incel that's just stupid and also Ben does not talk about men being oppressed because they can't get laid Ben does not talk about getting laid unless it is in the context of don't be promiscuous don't sleep around save yourself for marriage have some damn self-respect all of that is in an effort to raise men up to teach them to be better men better fathers to have good masculinity it's all incredibly positive I don't know what you were talking about but in classic David Hogg fashion he could not let it go because apparently all he thinks about is sex so he fired off some more tweets he's said imagine being almost 40 years old and acting like Ben Shapiro dead Emoji the man Brands himself as a hard-working American he literally made a name for himself acting like a 14 year old on 4chan what has he ever actually done besides fail in bed like that is the lowest insult that you could ever come up with you are late to the party people have been making that joke for years and it's just ridiculous because as this person pointed out who quote tweeted David Hogg he said noted ladies and men string bean David Hogg has bedroom advice for married guy with three children I don't think Ben is struggling in that department but David Hogg you seem to not be able to procreate and not be able to find a wife so maybe Ben should give you some advice I think that this tweet really sums it up which Ben also retweeted later on this guy said a lot of dunking in this thread but honestly it just made me sad for him and he retweeted the entire David hog thread because yes David Hogg is so bitter he has no hope for the future he is absolutely nihilistic and pessimistic his attacks are meaningless and repetitive and absolutely unoriginal he has nothing thought-provoking or intelligent to say on the subject so maybe he should just think about getting married and having kids maybe that would motivate him to work to leave a better future for his children and for the world maybe he would be a light or happy peppier person just saying do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure

it's been co-opted by by the queer community um to be a symbol of a safe drop in a pink triangle somewhere in your room makes a huge difference because kids look for that what teenager knows about the pink triangle from nazi germany that signifies lgbtq people so i guess she would be okay if a teacher hung a cross in the classroom right now should probably be real pissed about it somebody says the

when i was 12 years old and liked one direction i shouldn't say when i was 12 years old and liked one direction because i was literally listening to one direction in the car last night but that was probably the last time that i really sat around pondering like who harry styles was after the whole dress charade i just don't even really care anymore and i see all of these tick tocks of girl simping over him i genuinely don't get it he kind of makes me feel like he is just a off-brand walmart elton john kind of thing and i know people are gonna be upset about that puppy breaks kid that man's a national treasure but he is trying to lean into that kind of icon pop star persona and i think he's kind of missing the mark but hey i don't know maybe in 25 years i'll be surprised and i'll have to eat my words but i do have some news about him but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode so harry styles has been trending on twitter for the last couple of days and it's not for the reason you might think you know he's not releasing a new album he's not expanding his tour he's not wearing more dresses than he usually does it's not really about him a school in texas is teaching an entire college course on harry styles this is the advertisement for the course it was in this original post that i saw harry styles and the cult of celebrity identity the internet and the european pop culture seems like a pretty normal liberal arts class kind of weird that it's on somebody that's so current in my opinion but the cult of celebrity that's something interesting to talk about but here we'll get into the details this course focuses on the british musician harry styles and popular european culture to understand the cultural and political development of the modern celebrity as related to questions of gender and sexuality race class nation in globalism media fashion fan culture internet culture and consumerism checks all my boxes literally can we teach a class that is not hitting every single intersectional box all of the pop culture you know review accounts that sort of thing are posting about it and the people in the comment section are very split about it which i was enjoying because they were all arguing because guys harry styles fans they are wild it's kind of like the taylor swift fandom in a way like they will fight to the death let's do this if you thought one directioners were wild these people just take it to another level but i did appreciate the people that were kind of making jokes about it this person said hey mom thanks for paying my school fees and supporting me throughout high school i'm off to college to study harry styles now love you ah it's funny and sad cause it's true it's literally what happens in higher education somebody else said i just know that anyone taking this will end up in unemployment savage he literally only has three albums what is there to study not even hating at this point but genuinely curious and he's not even some sort of legendary artist or something that was kind of my point like i enjoy his music i think he's cool and i guess you can track his trajectory from one direction to this kind of budding you know legendary pop star that he is but i don't think i would take a class on him now i would want to take a class on somebody who was truly iconic that you know influenced a generation and we're seeing the ramifications of that we're living in the middle of the harry styles era it feels like a bs class i don't know maybe i'm going to get hate for this because like i said the fandom is wild but i wanted to see the professor teaching this because academics on twitter these days kind of scary and i was not disappointed this is the professor here he is louis dean valencia his cover photo is literally a picture of harry styles associate professor of digital history at uh this texas university um europe queer youth countercultures and anti-fascism follow for harry styles content checks all my boxes good lord his pinned comment until yesterday was current projects countercultures since antiquity kind of interesting i'd i'd dive into that uh hiv and aids in western europe contemporary far right youth culture online and harry styles on the internet in the cult of celebrity i really hope i get a shout out in the contemporary far right youth culture online if i'm not getting that what am i even doing here because apparently the moment that you step out of the liberal narrative you are a far-right extremist so maybe i'll have a little segment in the syllabi maybe i'll get a shout out but i'll know i've really made it if academics are angry at me he posted this which was the original tweet that got all this attention and now he's basically doing a media tour it's this little associate professor that probably just wanted to teach this course as a fun little hobby i was going on bbc and cnn and doing all of these interviews and getting profiles and articles written up about him it's absolutely wild so he said it's official official i'm teaching the world's first ever university course on the work of hashtag harry styles it's happening spring 2023 at texas state university see description this is what tenure looks like let's go and then he posted the email where he got confirmation that the class was happening and the original poster advertisement that i read at the beginning why do the worst professors get tenure that might get me hate but in my experience the worst professors that i had were tenured just because they knew they couldn't get fired so they would kind of put people through the ringer they also happened to be the professors that taught the wokeest classes in my major he was very active in his replies and i will say some of them were very pure because he's clearly excited about this and it was kind of cute to see people be like oh my god i love harry styles and he'll be like oh my god i love harry styles too like you can't not enjoy that because seeing people happy it's it's good but i liked this person hi have you asked harry styles if he is okay with you teaching a course on his private life yeah we're just gonna call up all these celebrities hey are you okay if i talk about you no they are a celebrity they know that we talk about them literally every day but he replied and said we will not focus on his private life only his art and public activism and the film literature and philosophy and music he has acknowledged as influential just in the way that we study the work of shakespeare tony morrison virginia woolf or any other great artist bro what are you talking about man somebody else replies good grief i am betting they wish the tenure could be withdrawn you're really comparing harry styles to tony morrison virginia woolf or shakespeare yes they are that first comment is really what got me the fact that he literally the first comparison that he made with shakespeare i'm all for doing a whole course on shakespeare jane austen i took all of those milton everything harry styles really is there anything similar but for 1d and stan or fandom culture and the professor replies and says every 1d album will be assigned homework i'm very sorry to any parents out there but yes this is some of the homework that your children are being assigned at college truly a rigorous rigorous academic experience other people were very excited about it this person said let me quick just transfer to texas state and change my entire college plan for this course no big deal this person had an issue and said i really don't want to be a hater but if they wanted an example of a celeb then why not taylor swift she's an icon has won more grammys than i can remember i guess if taylor swift was a man she would get more recognition here's the thing taylor swift already has a college course it caused a whole firestorm back in february i think i have the tweet pulled up here it is the hill nyu offering a taylor swift course in the spring semester the washington post did an article about it there were all of these tick tocks from the students that were in the nyu course going oh my god this is so amazing i can't believe this is my college experience again it weirds me out a bit but if you are in a digital major if you're studying music i guess it makes sense maybe i just have a stick up my ass because i was in a more academic major i have no idea you can call me on it if you want i don't really care but i went back and i was reviewing the comments from all the taylor swift stuff and somebody said i hated school but i'd go back in a heartbeat for taylor and this one said can someone please tell me why we idolized taylor swift so much basic everyday white girl that got famous because of pretty privilege and we're giving her her own nyu course thank you that's all i needed to further my college is a scam point lmao i highly doubt this person and i agree on a lot of things because they're pulling out the you know the white girl and the pretty privilege and all of that crap but the college is a scam point yeah and obviously i do love the liberal arts i loved going to college i absolutely support it if you think that is right for you if you are a nerd if you are anybody that is more academically inclined if you are interested in that but my god it is not for everybody and you can look at the courses that people are teaching you can look at the professors that are teaching these students and you know that this is not the higher education system that we had 50 60 70 100 years ago it's just not uh and so as long as you know that going into it then sure have at it but know that there are other options you can go to trade school you can go to a community college you don't have to go to college you can start creating something you can you know get a job right out of high school it is totally fine do not feel like you need to follow this weird path of just going to a small university and taking stupid glasses on harry styles and taylor swift in order to be successful you do not this stuff is ridiculous it really is do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i

this group so today we're going to be doing a team building exercise that's fun i'm captain juan no we're not splitting up into teams we're working as one team oh well there's just one team then like how do you win you don't win that's not the point of the game why would i want to play a game that i can't win that seems kind of pointless so we can learn how to work together morale if you guys would just let me actually results tend to vary with team building exercises in fact most have been proven to be pointless at a waste of time for all participants you know matthew i would really appreciate it if you didn't talk so much during these meetings oh my god that is so good somebody get this man a tv show these are kind of my favorite white guys in hollywood purely because they're so freaking awkward and real like sometimes you just get tired of like the you know the pratts and the hemsworth is and you just want some like pure comedy this guy's crushing it you know like 15 out of 10.", "aLW0eeriFis": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper big news came out of daily wire yesterday matt walsh's children's book johnny the walrus became the number one best-selling book on all of amazon if you don't know about matt's book it is about a little boy who gets it in his head that he wants to become a walrus and his very nice loving parents say no you are a human child you cannot be a walrus it triggers people per usual even though it is just such a sweet little children's book that is the book that became the number one bestseller on amazon yesterday but we could not have done that without the generous help of amazon employees themselves this is like the disney leaked footage 2.0 like this is even better so this time footage was leaked from an amazon call where employees were literally having a meltdown over matt's book we're all gonna die this is like some amazon employee like screen captured this and that's how it was leaked it's just fantastic let's get into it the uh recommendations that this customer received and that other customers frequently reach out to us about that they're receiving it's about a book called johnny the walrus and i want to be very clear the next two are about books and i saw someone say oh joy we're going to talk about one of them because it's been it's been a very traumatic experience for our transgender amazonians and our transgender customers hold on do you guys hear that we need to go back it's been a very traumatic experience for transgender amazonians transgender amazonians wouldn't it be amazonians he's saying amazonians like the amazon people right that's cultural appropriation they need to check themselves johnny the walrus is a bit of a problematic book uh not a bit it's one hell of a problem and i would preface this about what the book's about but the customer we're going to listen to does a great job so i didn't know we were in here let's go ahead and listen to this customer i just checked your website she sounds awful the book is still up on there i hate to tell you but it is by matt walsh it is teaching kids to kill well to bully transgenders yeah to to bully them into committing suicide she hasn't read the book now the author matt walsh just tweeted this yesterday morning at 804 am i now have the number one anti-lgbt book in the country any further criticism of me or my book is homophobic how's it going you are selling a manual how to teach kids to bully other kids to commit suicide does this lady not have anything better to do also on the side it says customer but we know that this lady's name is karen like it has to be she's the lgbtq karen like this woman has obviously not read the book it's like this it's like the same scenario with the parental rights education bill or the don't say gay bill where people were screaming about it for the last month and a half when clearly they have not even read the bill it's the same thing with johnny the walrus nowhere in the book does it discuss lgbtq anything does not talk about killing kids or bullying or anything these people have so little going on in their lives so so few problems that they just decide to make a mountain of them so that they can feel important i know that that was you know cringe to listen to but there's more so this is after the phone call has finished with a customer now we're getting back to the employees so johnny the walrus this book takes the form of a children's book it's like a cardboard you know like preschool style wait hold on this person talking sounds like a man but they're dressed like a woman look at the person talking this person looks like your quintessential like middle school guidance counselor but then listen to the voice that comes out you saw in the that is a man customer contact how uh she was talking about freaking man what the hell is even that um i got distracted let's actually hear what this man has to say the book made it to number one bestseller in lgbtq books and actually i think was number four of all books for uh a day now number one which is it's bad faith it's basically abuse of amazon systems to promote their particular brand of hate and harm on the community oh wait you're serious let me laugh even harder [Laughter] taking advantage of the amazon systems no all mad did was write a children's book have it be published put it on amazon to be distributed and people are buying it people buying a book because they want to read it is not abusive or hacking your little system he literally did what every other author did except he's much more successful because people are fed up with the woke bs it's that simple not everything that doesn't go your way is abusive news flash no i don't want to talk about it i don't i don't want to talk about anything will you talk about it but yes i will yeah that's kind of how life works a lot of times you don't want to do the things that you know we have to do like this man clearly matt walsh is haunting his nightmares [Music] i love the like pregnant pauses that are happening at this moment in time where they're like it's still being sold they can't even speak because of how horrified they are the other part of this that is equally disturbing is um matt walsh is getting ready to release um i believe um a book called what is a woman and there's also a documentary that comes with it i jamie lee shared some information with me about the movie um the documentary that's going along with it but people are already talking about it he tricked this made us speechless one man's journey to answer the question i mean like does that like let's just back up for a second and say does a man even belong in this conversation no he doesn't that's ironic to say considering there are two men leading this conversation right now this guy's a man and this one is a is a man pretending to be a woman this is they're two men leading the conversation ironic he's not even letting the fake woman speak patriarchy y'all the lack of self-awareness on this amazon call no words it's not even on sale yet and it's number one in women's studies damn right it is this is a case of someone exploiting our systems right our systems aren't like they're not set up to catch you know they can you know the self-publishing authors they can amazon systems aren't set up to catch conservatives the next thing they're going to do is they're going to change their system that is too easily exploitable to make sure that they're filtering out all the conservative stuff i guarantee that's what their next move is going to be we're going to have like little red flags and trigger warnings over these books yeah i want to i just i'm sorry he's crying i want to preface this with i also saw someone mention that this is really tough content and if you're transgender if you're gender non-binary i mean like look at these people they look like this is the worst day of their lives it's like a conservative being successful matt walsh being successful is so triggering to them that it like makes them want to die like they need to have a will in place which lucky for all of you actually my new sponsor is epic will epicwheel.com is our new partner here at daily wire they are protecting us our entire staff so you can go to epicwill.com use code cooper for 10 off of your package they make the process so easy it's literally five minutes and then you can get back to watching my videos knowing that your future is secure because i know that i put you guys through hell with what we watch together but it's not as awful as the day that these two are having clearly this is for education for people who don't get it who don't understand and i would understand if if this was a lot but equally i want folks to know um that we that we're doing this because this really matters um to get this education out there and the final thing we're going to show is a 30 second clip um brace yourself brace yourself my new goal should be to like have one of my videos played at like a corporate town hall and i could be shunned for that i think it'd be kind of fun that's when i will know that i've made it of mount walsh reading his book mommy was told to take oh i'm gonna cut off never mind that video is on youtube if you want to see matt reading the book that was a train wreck but obviously it worked out for matt he ended up being on tucker last night the book shot up to number one i think what is woman is still number one i can't wait to see what's happening in amazon right now they're probably having a meltdown that man started crying when it was at number four the man's probably just having a day off for himself self-care you know i went through the comments on um and libs of tick tock who posted it i'm glad somebody else caught this he says does a man even belong in this conversation says the man dominating the conversation yes with a man sitting next to him take a look in the mirror pal transgender amazonians is my new favorite phrase how many transgender amazonians are there i just have to know they need to worry less about the most accomplished lgbtqi iap plus authors and more about their public speaking skills because that seminar was atrocious yeah yeah it was the disney people had more charisma than that man never go for [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is bad vibes all around i'm sorry but isn't 75 of amazon's business selling chinese crafted garbage made by exploited workers yes all of these posturing progressive corporations they are incredibly hypocritical when it comes to all of their overseas operations they say one thing to american audiences to bend a knee to the left and it's crazy ideology but then when it comes to their operations overseas these mega corporations they they cut lgbtq scenes out of movies for chinese and middle eastern audiences they exploit workers they use labor camps they turn a blind eye to the uyghur camps and then they just come back to america and pretend like they're not doing any of that and then they change their logo to have a rainbow flag and everybody applauds them and says oh my god you are the beacon of light hope humanity and equity like give me a break it's all posturing it is all fake these corporations they don't actually care about your social justice agenda they do it for money because it is profitable in the united states and that's the sad part is that our society has fallen so far that that kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] is what sells they know that and it's making the money it's atrocious maybe elon needs to buy amazon do you want to be the only person that is not caught up on the internet's latest chaos i don't think so so make sure you subscribe and ring that bell so you don't miss out on any comment section content", "Yxswxo6dy-o": "what's up guys welcome back to the comments section i'm brad cooper so as every president does biden had a lot of appearances this week however unlike most other presidents he embarrassed our country at basically every single one mr wise guy over here part of me hates saying that because i genuinely don't know how much of this behavior biden can control like it is truly painful watching a clearly sick geriatric man being propped up like a puppet by his family and all the democrat masterminds it's it's really kind of sad when we think about it but does that mean that i'm going to ignore all of his gaffes and not use them for content absolutely not i mean come on making fun of politicians is basically an american pastime and no one is safe from the comment section i'm starting off strong because this one might be my personal favorite educating the future of this country and it's i've been impressed i've been on a lot of university campuses matter of fact for four years i was a full professor at the university of pennsylvania and this is really an impressive place from a lot of impressive students what first of all guys every time he touches the eyebrow lying lying watch all of his videos lying second of all he was a full professor at u-pen for four years no the man can't even complete full sentences has he ever been equipped to be a professor not in my mind maybe like 150 years ago when he first started in politics so clearly this is a lot of bull crap and fact checkers were quick to jump in obviously not the real fact checkers but just people on the internet and i saw this article from daily caller apparently this isn't the first time that he's made this claim i read it and apparently after leaving the vice presidency upenn paid biden almost a million dollars to be a honorary professor and all he had to do to get his million dollars was just show up at the campus sometimes and wander around i mean it's the perfect job for him that's all he does anyway just wanders and stares at things but what's actually concerning is does he think that that's what professors do that they just stroll on college campuses and that made him a full professor comments were superb this is my personal favorite i bet corn pop was his graduate assistant this person was uh not thrilled with this video being posted yawn he taught at trump university fools somebody responded with that flag in your bio you aren't even qualified for the university of phoenix okay listen the whole trump university thing no that was wild i know but the reply to that tweet is just like chef's kiss it's too good funny no one is really sure what he's doing at 69 at 1600 pennsylvania avenue either this is not as sad as as this next video will make you this is from a presentation on ghost guns and the atf which by the way should be abolished and no you cannot change my mind so let's just take a gander at this a functioning firearm you bought a gun take a look he's on the move you can see the picture down here maybe this is the gun it's not hard to put together a little drill hand drill at home doesn't take very long anyone can order the mail anyone ah god it's just really ironic watching him be like anybody could put this together meanwhile he can't find his way back to the podium also i'm not fully convinced that that is a ghost gun it looks like they just disassembled the glock and set it there and we're like just pretend pretend like this came in a little like lego box for you give him instructions and all day to do it i say there's no way he puts one together i don't i don't watch like twitch and video game streaming but i would pay good money to watch joe biden attempt to assemble a ghost gun or any puzzle for that matter i think it'd be highly entertaining uh this next one i see a ghost holding a gun is that where it got the name i was clever that was clever universal background check didn't keep hunter biden from lying on it to get a gun clean your own closets before you start trying to restrict my rights hell yeah scott sterling i just can't his son had a workaround he got the gun and then he disposed of it in the trash near a school rules for thee but not for me number three of biden's best gaffes of the week this is biden with imaginary friends [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right well he's going the wrong way oh there we go yes sir you figured it out [Applause] so he finishes off with one of his classic you know joe biden line do you guys remember at the end of the state of the union go get him it was that same vibe the icing on the cake with this whole thing is that the band is like joyously playing stars and stripes forever meanwhile this man is like having a breakdown on stage and it's like yes america and he's like zombieing his way off the stage somebody says maybe he saw a ghost gun and was surrendering all of his voters are ready to shake his hand oh no oh yeah when uh when i die don't let me vote democrat am i right i don't really feel more uplifted after watching all of those videos i i kind of feel like crippling sense of dread that i'm masking with humor it's kind of how i live my life every single day in these troubled times but that's why i'm here we're here to laugh about it so i'm glad you guys could be on this ride with me okay last one for the day this isn't a specific gaffe or action it's just every single part of this video is sad so we're gonna watch it and by the way major shout out to greg price on twitter for posting these clips he's dope and he's my favorite source of terrible dc videos so my dude thank you so much because could not do this segment without you okay here we go this is just a hot mess no it's not his campaign here and i made that commitment i don't think anybody heard it but we're back we're back and i uh my name is joe biden i work for congressman axne there she is i learned a long time ago when she says i have a i just say yes i say yes what in the hell is he talking about he's not the president he works for a congresswoman this is news to me might also be news to him like how sad is it that they put this man up on stage who is clearly not mentally there and we're all supposed to act like it's fine everyone look away please nothing to see here somebody if joe biden was a car if he had a full-on stroke on national live tv how would we even know yeah we wouldn't i mean come on like genuinely this man is not equipped to be president and it just goes to show how much goes on behind the scenes in terms of you know pulling the strings and getting him up on stage and you know pushing some script in front of him like biden is embarrassing and filled with bad ineffective policies we all know that but he's not the only one that we should be criticizing like i think we need to be criticizing all of his handlers for putting this poor elderly man through this he does not need to be in the oval office he needs to be like drinking marks with jimmy buffett and margaritaville that's my hot take hey guys we're adding new

you're not actually a lady because if they call you a lady because they see the long hair then they're wrong even if a child did misgender me i would not blame the child because they don't understand the ramifications of their actions i would absolutely blame the parent why the are you raising your child in a binary that's going to oppress them and everybody else get over yourself and don't freaking blame the parents that is not your child you don't get a say in what they teach them somebody said this is a great example of why it doesn't take a village to raise a child yeah the left has

basically everybody is a non-binary lgbtqia plus whatever because everybody wants to be part of some Community especially this week there was a special amount of gayness because there was a special holiday but before we get into that make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection which I am actually wearing something from right here this is the purple cropped hoodie from the binge kit I also have the black one I've literally been living in them and I'm not saying that just because it's my own but like our creative team absolutely crushed it this stuff is sick just saying now that I'm very comfortable let's talk about all these celebrities who have decided to come out to this week pop crave posted it on Twitter they said Shay Mitchell Madonna and Emily umski rat rata jakowski ratajikowski I think that's right I know that my editors are gonna have fun with that they always do anyway have all come out as queer in the past week now Madonna I would have expected that she was already queer and I think that Shay Mitchell has already been open about it and pop crave obviously is just kind of a cesspool of ridiculous pop culture stuff but Emily this one is kind of new and apparently all of this went down with all three of these women on Tick Tock which is kind of sad but also unsurprising because as you all know today's culture and news is all pushed by a Chinese propaganda dancing app so not really surprising there but anyway let's look at Shea and Emily's tick tocks you identify as bisexual do you own a green velvet okay so it's very simple it's very covert but it's a kind of complex if you're not on Tick Tock there is a girl and she posted this thing and she said if you're bisexual you have a green velvet couch because apparently all bisexuals have a green velvet couch Shay Mitchell do wedded it and went oh look here's my green velvet couch and then Emily stitched it and put that on top of Shea Mitchells and said look at me I also have a green velvet couch and everybody in the comments was like holy crap she's bisexual this is such a win for ladies oh my God oh my God literally because of a 10 second video This is how news moves through the world in 2022 it's absolutely wild and like I said Shea was apparently already out so she was you know just jumping on the trend this is new for Emily stands the ladies are very excited and I'm kind of bothered to be totally honest because like I probably would buy a green velvet couch I love colorful Furniture I have a gray couch I don't have one right now but I have teal chairs I have teal accent chairs I have an orange velvet accent chair in my bedroom does me liking very brightly colored eccentric Furniture make me bisexual sorry those are the rules I don't think so so I don't know where this is all coming from but I'm just bothered that they are infringing upon my colorful Furniture culture that was a mouthful Madonna though like I said I would have expected that she was already queer she's a bit nutty these days we've talked about her tick tocks before she gets very close to the camera and does some very intimate things which nobody needs to see and I think she made up her own Trend to jump on I'm not really sure but let's just go ahead and watch this video um what is this at oh it's Jamie's razors when a McLaren or 250 000 cash that is so cool I would pick I actually don't think I've ever asked you guys what you would pick I should do that I want to post it on Instagram let's do a question Jeremy's McLaren or 250 000 in cash let's see what you guys say okay that'll be fun to see where was I Madonna looking freaky I guess here we go here she is [Music] like what is this so the caption says if I miss I'm gay and then she holds up a pair of hot pink underwear that apparently match her hair and she does a terrible toss intentionally missing the trash can and it's like oh I'm gay I don't I've not seen maybe this is the trend that I've just missed out on but can we also just go back a little bit like Madonna what is going on what um like something is going on here I've seen recent photos of her and she looks fine but in this Tick Tock it's like oh this whole thing is just like it reeks cringe Boomer trying to be cool on Tick Tock pumped up with some kind of drugs I'm not exactly sure what don't come at me for that how do you do fellow kids somebody commented and said celebs coming out in cryptic tick tocks is my new favorite genre it's just confusing to be honest and the fact that it is a genre a subset of tick tock is just wild Madonna's though to be fair was not very cryptic she was literally like if I miss I'm gay and then very intentionally missed a lot of people are commenting on her looks though somebody said I thought that was Marilyn Manson somebody else said my sleep paralysis demon like what is going on I just want to know like I said she looks fine in recent photos like she's been out and about with her son recent photos with the pink hair obviously some of those photos are a bit airbrushed she's wearing more makeup but this literally looks like it was filmed on a potato immediately following her Botox treatment and maybe she forgot to paint on her eyebrows I get it sometimes I pick up my camera to film something and I realize that it's you know 8 am in the morning before I've done my makeup and it's like oh Brett you look like a rat mixed with like a baby bird so I understand it but also Madonna honey to fix something I don't know somebody said what do you mean you're amazed Madonna came out as gay where have you been since 2003 and then they have photos of her like with other girls again like I would have expected that she was also such a champion of gay rights in you know the 90s and the early 2000s and she pushed a lot of advocacy for AIDS awareness and all that stuff forward so it's really it's not surprising I don't know why this is news people are freaking out about it somebody else said Madonna has been having sex with women for longer than the internet has existed this is not not news and apparently these people who are commenting about her already being queer are just bigots which I learned because didn't you know that you can come out as many times as you want you don't have to just come out of the closet once coming out is just a constant evolutionary yearly daily weekly event somebody said it is coming out day reminder that you never have to come out you can come out constantly or you can have this wholesome Bliss and let them speculate Linda Carter jumped in and said coming out isn't just a one-time thing for most people nor is it something that everyone feels safe enough to do now I learned this coincidentally and also not very coincidentally because two days ago was National Coming Out day so my feed was like swamped with this kind of stuff so perfect timing for Madonna and her PR team to post that you know potato sleep paralysis demon Tick Tock and just my entire Twitter was just filled with so many virtue signaling Ally posts like this like I see you and you can come out anytime you want however many times you want if you want to change your sexuality you know later down the line just come out again it's great people are competing for which his sexuality was most misunderstood and oppressed I actually think it's um a Romantics that thread I think was most compelling to me because up until today I thought that a Romantics was just aromatics every time I read it I was like why are they talking about things smelling good so apparently I've educated myself as well the other thing I learned is that apparently gay and lesbian is just very Antiquated because now there are fifteen hundred thousand sexualities which is probably why everybody has to come out constantly because it's always changing and they want to be on the current thing so that's why there are hundreds of new coming out Tick Tock Trends very excited to jump on that so excited for everybody's fluidity this just keeps getting worse do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that Bell so you never miss an episode", "tVFRWERu4rU": "how I dated 49 000 women in New York City at the same time step one I reverse engineered all the major dating apps and stored 49 000 profiles database I don't like where this is going they built an artificial intelligence based on the personalities of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho and James Bond in the end I got around 500 numbers and some of the girls really liked the AI like and follow for more big brain hacks this actually looks very cool and sounds like a dope idea but maybe next time you do it don't use the most psychotic men in all of Cinema that just might help you also in the amount of time that you spent creating this AI you probably could have met a girl in real life and gotten a girlfriend because like this commenter pointed out he said I'm sorry to fill this nerd in but he didn't date anybody you really just swiped on 49 000 people you weren't dating 49 000 people I feel like that took a lot of precious time and energy away from dating somebody said pathetic scared to use his own personality a lot of men are these days sadly", "Q-Tizpcsru4": "so per is a neo pronoun that comes from the word person which is why i really like him so i would say hi everyone meet rosie per ask me to introduce per to you since pear can't do it herself right now per is on my bed because per thinks it's purse you know there's that whole graph where it says that as like the political parties move farther away they end up just like coming back to each other i feel like that's what's happened with pronouns that we've we've strayed so far that now we're just coming back to identifying as people in english class they made us diagram sentences and i thought that was the most pointless and tedious thing ever until i tried to watch a video explaining neo pronouns yeah tiller garden do something with your life besides obsessing over your identity and sexuality jesus yeah these people have nothing going on in their lives so they're creating more problems for

are now in fifth grade and they come visit me almost every day after school and a lot of them are queer because i am queer and so and they figured it out and so i've become their safe space and today they found my guest who and i started playing guess who but they didn't play the normal way how did they play it they used things like this person looks like a lesbian batty who's going to come over and make you dinner well which one of these characters is going to be is a lesbian batty that's going to over make you dinner oh olivia is oh great these kids i'm so happy that they are figuring out who they are and that they're happy with who they are and that they found a safe place but man i could never imagine being in fifth grade saying these things out loud even though i know they're all all okay i grew up super religious where nothing was okay somebody said so she's saying queerness is a choice because um how are they queer because you were queer yeah she almost got some common sense so close", "9uKTYFuPPkI": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper yesterday i had planned to talk about the met gala i was sitting in bed with my bag of chips on my chest judging everyone's outfits when the news about roe v wade broke the internet so i quickly changed gears and we did that episode yesterday but i just couldn't let this monumentous event go by without commenting on it first of all the theme for this year was i think was like gilded age glamour i think of like old new york aristocratic style you know the golden age of new york city basically people really didn't stay on theme and i've noticed that in recent years people are taking lots of liberties with this which is weird because you know it's the metropolitan museum of art and it's supposed to be like an artistic thing and people are showing up in really weird outfits that are not even on brand somebody said this year's metgala theme must have been the sheen age not the gilded age is it sheen or shine or sheen sheen sheen it's that chinese clothing website that everybody got super into during cove and i never ordered anything from it because you know screw china fashion in the gilded age is supposed to be about showing off your wealth and extravagance why are these celebs wearing party dresses that look like they came from a czar sale yeah i have a picture for this here are the kardashians uh all excluding kim which we'll talk about later but um and need i say more i call it bold and bright more like belongs in the trash the met has become such like an influencer and rapper heaven it's just kind of weird but i guess those are the times that we live in like tick tockers are invited and now it's like really like i saw you dance on tick tock with your ass out a couple of days ago that's weird the first outfit that really took me back was amy schumer what oh yeah look at that so she has the sunglasses her hair looks like she needs some dry shampoo she's wearing this oversized coat that could be like a men's blazer some weird shoes like literally walk of shame chic not even walk of shame chic just like purely she probably came from some guy's house she also made some very weird comments about the theme when you hear guild of glamour what do you think um i don't know i guess i think about like a vibrator amy schumer making a sex joke real original never seen that before this would be a great time for my newest sponsor adam and eve come on it's matt gala get your head out of the gutter also her weird little like when she pulled out her glasses lady you're not you're not getting any from that oh we didn't laugh i mean i did but it was more discomfort someone else said why they invited that unseasoned poultry dish to this it was good another awkward moment was emma chamberlain who guys i love she's one of the og youtubers for my generation i used to watch her videos all the time she was an interviewer for vogue on the red carpet she did a very awkward interview with jack harlow who is like the latest singer songwriter heartthrob sorry i'm like reapplying my makeup one moment he did a great job she's not even ready yet he comes over she's still doing her makeup a suit did you have any like freak out today did you have like a moment today where you're like actually i might like maybe i am freaked out did you for sure okay then yes okay perfect oh so you're matching my answer i just want to make sure we're comfortable on the same page that's so weird somebody says he gives me where my hug ad vibes me friendzoning every man i meet he was so clearly being weird and like into her she has a boyfriend i think she that she did well of like handling it making jokes about it this pic has great potential and it's him leaning into another girl and her being like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] did i just say uh we need to meme that bad touch stranger danger like look at her face she looks like she wants to die it's me after every awkward

into some of the fashion there was a big letdown of the evening usually the kardashians raised the bar the one i really want to focus on is kylie jenner it's a wedding dress with a odd like t-shirt top and a backwards baseball cap with a veil this gives me like early 2000s say yes to the dress when like some like skater girl comes in is like i want to match my energy avril lavigne avril lavigne but not goth boom there we go didn't know fashion nova was styling people this year yeah that stuff i genuinely feel bad because she looks like she's starting to regret all of her decisions and she's standing there taking those photos and to be fair usually i think for events like this you connect with a designer and the designer really just picks what you're gonna wear and you go with it but i feel like at her level she should have some sway the other part of all of this is that that designer recently died and it was kind of a tribute so maybe she hated it was like oh my god this person just died i can't say no so not the greatest night for her to be honest her sister kim kardashian who went with pete davidson turned heads she was not photographed with any of her sisters probably because she thought she looked better than all of them she wore marilyn monroe's iconic happy birthday mr president dress like the the actual dress they got it out of the archives she wore it she also dyed her hair blonde and apparently she had to lose like 40 pounds to fit into it and like two days ago she went and did a fitting and tried it on and she still had to lose another 16 pounds so i feel like for the last two days kim has been like in trash bags like doing cardio like a ufc fighter trying to you know get into a lower weight class or something the internet has been conflicted and honestly very angry they feel like she does not deserve to be in the marilyn monroe dress there are a lot of comparisons saying like kim is the marilyn of this generation she is the sex icon all of that people are angry new york post says marilyn monroe experts say that kim kardashian isn't worthy that gown is a national treasure someone replied and said there are marilyn monroe experts marilyn monroe fought her whole life to be taken seriously and to be loved by the time of her death no one cared enough to protect her estate and now somehow people are gifting her hair which jesus christ really to kim kardashian she deserves better i agree did you guys ever watch that tv show smash it only went on for like two seasons but it's about the creation of a musical about marilyn monroe's life but through that you learn a lot about her i gained a lot of admiration and respect for marilyn through that show it's a killer tv show highly recommend going and watching it that's just an interesting debate that's happening on the internet right now i don't know exactly where i land but i think i'm more sympathetic to maryland and of course moving on from fashion there were political statements eric adams the mayor of nyc was apparently very inspired by aoc's tax the rich dress from last year so he wore a suit it was so brave of him really it's brave he said end gun violence and then it has all of this art on it a uh pistol with the you know the x through it stunning and brave am i right snaps snaps for eric someone commented and said he should run for mayor and fix the problem i'm guessing because he's the mayor of new york city he probably got in for free but paying all of this money being in there with all of those elites to make these cheap political statements to make themselves look good to get snaps and applause from the progressive left it's just weird it's odd it don't matter none of this matters hillary clinton was there looking like the queen of the chipmunks look at her her dress also looks like it's backwards i'm also kind of giving handmaid's tale vibes so maybe she knew about this roe v wade thing that was happening during the met gala this picture kind of encapsulates the last two years because look at her looking like a crazy demonic freak and then there's a man here with a mask leaning down fixing her dress can we stop this performative virtue signaling coveted fear and in case you've forgotten and you need to be re-radicalized in new york city the only people that have a mass mandate right now are three to five-year-olds three to five-year-olds are forced to be masked in that city i feel like they're probably just keeping that so that they have like a touchstone so that if they want to you know push another mass media then they'll just throw the other ones back on they're not completely giving up their power it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] and it's wrong it's if you don't think that that's harming children i don't know what to tell you to end this episode on a more wholesome note elon musk was there he brought his mother he did a cute interview with her but before i do that you have to see this video of him dancing what is he doing he's so rich it doesn't matter i love him so it doesn't matter but here's the interview with his mom which is just so sweet she's also an icon she's stunning but here we go sir i'd say you are the man that's being much talked about around town and around the world and maybe on twitter i don't know social media is kind of going bananas over you right now i guess that's uh yeah that's probably true there are some critics out there that would say why didn't you use the money that you purchased twitter with to do something for charity philanthropy we're good with that money why is this entertainment tonight reporter trying to ask elon these vague hard-hitting questions that the people want to know about about his wealth and what he's doing with it we're we're over that oh my god who the hell cash stop it it's the matt gala nobody cares he does a good job of answering it though do a lot of things uh philanthropically yeah um and um really uh my companies are intended to do good for the future of humanity uh aspirationally i am trying to do good for uh humanity he's such a class act in that response how does a man that is so tapped into so much that's going on in the world today making the time to come to an event like this the backyard why is it important to be here this evening i wanted him to come my mom wanted to come so uh that i brought my mom that's the reason that's so cute i love it i take my mom to everything so i relate that honestly was probably my favorite part of the whole evening other than that it was just a lot of chaos and weird interactions apparently there were a lot of exes that ran into each other there it's just typical weird celebrity stuff but i do kind of like the met gala because it feels like we're in some simulation because it's not an award show we're not watching the celebrities do anything we just see them going in these outlandish outfits walk up the steps and then they go into a private room with no phones they look at an art exhibit and they all have to sit at tables together and create like weird conversation and then they leave like imagine if you got sat at a table with all of these other celebrities but you didn't know who they were and you had to make like awkward conversation like if you were sat at like the singles table at a wedding like that's how i feel like the entire event is so that makes me laugh and it the fact that they're probably weirded out by all of it makes me entertained and per usual me brett cooper the benevolent host of the comment section watching these outlandish elitist events so that you don't have to i do it for the people honestly i'm a woman of the people hey guys we're adding new comments section content every day so make sure you like

better off when they are allowed to take the lead in exploring and expressing their gender identity we will not be in puberty blockers on our child until they ask us to do so because we don't want to

raise their kids gender neutral slash creative don't dress their kids in quote boys or girl clothes but we actually do we dress them in absolutely anything and everything except items with gender

section I'm Brett Cooper today we're going to talk about liver well I mean specifically we are going to talk about liver King I could actually talk about liver if you guys wanted to because I have recently started taking some liver supplements it's kind of bad timing for me to do that considering what I'm about to tell you about liver King but you know I've seen great results so that's good anyway liver King the Instagram god of the Primal diet and eating the bull testicles has been exposed because the ancestral Primal carnivore lifestyle that he makes millions promoting every month is not as natural as he has led people to believe because he takes steroids and a lot of them and I have thoughts and you have ears but before I get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring that notification Bell and of course if you want more content you can follow me at I'm Brett Cooper on Instagram and Twitter and I also have some Tick Tock pages in Snapchat and you know how to find all of that stuff alrighty so outkick posted this yesterday they said shocking liver King was on steroids linked emails show that liver King was taking almost twelve thousand dollars worth of pharmacist suitable HGH per month three injections per day all while promoting his brand of holistic lifestyle ancestral tenants and eating raw meat on camera now if you have not seen liver King before here's just a taste my editors also might be able to pull some more Extreme videos but these are recent ones that he has on his Instagram what up primals liver King here we just took down a Mongolian yak and where do you think we're gonna start of course deliver first because liver is King uh foreign [Music] God he's so strange now I have to be honest here I follow liver King I think he's entertaining these videos make me cringe but I also can't look away I think it's fascinating here's another one this is him eating bone marrow he also has this wife who is also jacked and his kids all sit around and they feels like a throne at his table or something like that and they sit around like eating bone marrow together and talking about like bone density and how to work on your jaw health and stuff like that it's just so strange it's like I need a reality TV show here we go little King here we just finished butchering our cow and we have this beautiful piece of femur bone and you'll never have bone marrow that's fresher than this so let's have a bite foreign like look at that fresh piece of bone marrow [Music] that's the most delicious butter you'll ever have a king listen I love bone marrow and it's on the menu at a restaurant I will get it I give my dogs bone marrow my dogs eat liver I've been around all of this stuff I will not eat it raw absolutely not that is just that is what he does that is what he promotes it is what he is known for and very few people look like that naturally but time and time again liver King has denied ever taking steroids or performance enhancing drugs he says no it's just because I eat all of this and I take my liver King supplements that you can buy right here that is an outright lie and Derek Fitness that is an account he's great I just recently started following him I found him just yesterday he got to the bottom of it he has a whole video essay about it but this is just a taste but you can go to his channel if you want to see the entire thing because it really is interesting but this is like the trailer he boasted basically leaked emails blood test results and a full steroid cycle breakdown that's what we're going to be getting into in this video and it is shocking to say the least before we do though it only feels fitting to go back to the beginning because it's very much feels like a story that has come come full circle for us on this channel and do what the Justice it deserves by fleshing it out from inception [Music] anyway it's a fantastic video it's long but if you're interested in this sort of thing it is definitely worth watching it tells the liver King story he dives into all of the steroids and hormones and all of that I don't know anything about that world so it's interesting to learn about it but like I said I have followed this guy so I was like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is kind of crazy here is an up close of the email that was leaked and that outkick was posting there's a bunch of other things that Derek talks about in this video but this is the screenshot that has really gone viral now like I said I don't know anything about steroids or that sort of thing I barely even go to the gym but in case you guys are interested I wanted to read them for you and sheller's here and stroller is a former gym rat so you can provide any insight if you know anything about these okay uh he's been taking igf-1lr CJC with IMAP IBU to Morin omnotrope test cyp something per week Deca and wind stroll now I probably mispronounced those I have no idea what I'm talking about you guys probably do and that is great you can also go watch the video and learn more about it now the other important part of this email other than just like the list of steroids is that he literally states that he is only trying to stay in shape and you know take all of these things so that his body matches up with a character that he's promoting with his liver King brand so that he can promote and sell his ancestral supplements like he literally says like I'm the face of several Brands I'm pouring ridiculous resources so I have to stay in great shape year round he's been working out for 35 years he knows how to eat train and rest and recover but I'm in my mid-40s and it's getting harder and the back fat kills me me too man we all have body image issues you know what you're just one of us it's fine then it goes into why he's now started taking all of these steroids it's literally just so he can make more money because he's insecure now if he wanted to do all of this and he wanted to take steroids that's fine it's your life the thing that is making everybody angry is that you are lying while peddling all of your products and then you're hiding it for everybody a lot of people were saying like duh no [\u00a0__\u00a0] just look at him like this guy said in other news water is wet somebody else said the least surprising tweet of the day why would a man lie on the internet this guy said who did you guys and Derek Fitness think that you were exposing like anyone who watches a liver King knows that he doesn't have a natural body it only takes one look stop trying to ruin this man's life like I don't care if people assumed that he was on steroids or they didn't know or they'd you know thought it because of how he looks the man adamantly told people that he never did steroids it wasn't like he's never discussed this before he was honest about it he denied it constantly that is the problem Derek isn't just trying to ruin liver King for his own personal gain or for fun he is pursuing truth and integrity now this comment really hits a nail on the head in my opinion he says that's not the issue the issue is that he was claiming to be natural and promoting and selling his supplements by claiming that they would give people the same results yes because not only did he constantly lie about what he was doing in his personal journey and training Journey but he's peddling his own products that he claims will give you the same natural results that is the problem now if you want to support a brand that actually uses natural ingredients and their people do not take steroids you should try out balance of nature because I'm guessing that most of us are not on performance enhancing drugs and we realize that those are you know not the best course of action but we still want to take care of ourselves we want to eat healthy we want to exercise but that lifestyle is not particularly easy especially when you live a busy life balance of nature fruits and veggies are the best way to make sure that you are getting those essential nutritional ingredients every single day their products are 100 whole food and they use a cold vacuum process that preserves the natural phytonutrients in whole fruits and vegetables and encapsulates them for easy daily consumption I've been using balance of nature products for the last

when you go to their website you will not see any juice jacked scary men eating bull testicles in front of you it's dressed fruits and vegetables now this expose is not the first time that this has been publicly speculated about liver King Joe Rogan actually called him out as a fraud back in August I have this audio clip here the liver King thing drives me nuts because that guy's on steroids I know he's eating really healthy it's clear he's eating all his animal foods and you know he's eating organ meat which is very rich in nutrients well that's true but he's dodging the main bullet it's too late from now because he said no yeah so if he is even on trt he's he should come out and just say it well look at it because yeah I mean just do you know how rare it is to have a physique like that and not be on steroids okay that whole video is great but the most important point is that liver King is constantly dodging that question or just outright saying no I'm not taking any of those drugs like he went on pardon my take which is barcel sports podcast like a few months ago and one of the guys said to him he was like dude no you're definitely on Peds you've got to be taking Peds liver King like paused a moment he was like no no yeah I I'm on Peds I'm on like the Primal exclusive diet so we created some stupid acronym to avoid answering the question that everybody in the room was like oh that's so funny or whatever and then they moved on like no he's bullshitting you he's just going around the question he actually should be the press secretary that's he's good at it okay back to the point that Joe Rogan video caused a whole Firestorm and liver King even made a response video again denying allegations but this time he did it in like a skit form and he said oh I've gotten my blood work from my doctor and here it is certified Primal and with something okay that's been deleted now I found it on Twitter but the video was acting up so I hope we're able to get it it's totally wiped there were articles written about it the links are all broken so liver king is not saying anything about these accusations now he's just wiping the evidence there's also another video of him just being like I'm just happy Joe Rogan's talking about me even though he thinks I'm on PDS the farther I go into this episode the more I just like him while filming this episode I was able to find his response on YouTube shorts but like literally everything is wiped in the original video I found it's now glitching it's very very weird but it's gone off of his Instagram but uh here is his response to Rogan the liver King thing drives me nuts because that guy's on steroids what a private blood work done Doc is on his way to give me the results okay little King I got your blood results show them don't tell him doc we did find something unusual [Music] he's literally such a [\u00a0__\u00a0] people can see through that so easily and now you're actively trying to cover up the evidence absurd now fighter Eddie Alvarez also jumped in because apparently he accused liver king of using steroids last year through Instagram DMS and liver King was privately denying it as well he said the liver King's response to my accusations last year and he said I've never cheated or taken a shortcut into any capacity of life you earn the life and wife that you behold and he's going around and talking about how you have to optimize your testosterone and I'm not taking anything anyway you can read that whole response there if you want just man up and tell the truth is all I'm asking if you want to take the steroids that's fine it's your life be honest because you have a huge community of people that are following you for health advice for lifestyle advice that's not something you can shortcut and lie about some people did have a semi-different take though that I want to highlight because I think it brings up an interesting conversation this guy said this is shocking to absolutely nobody well I'd certainly prefer him to be more upfront about his supplementation that doesn't mean that you can't also learn from the ancestral tendency expect houses there's definitely Merit there I agree somebody else responded and said the worst part of liver King getting exposed for steroids is that normies will discredit his physique and attribute it to a 10K a month of HGH in reality he trained like a madman twice a day and walked 10 miles a day 99.9 of people wouldn't look like him even with steroids somebody else said most dudes could take two times over King's ped list still be built like Pete Davidson because they don't work in our consistent facts don't at me now I think that all three of these commenters make incredibly valid points because we do need various types of strong masculine Role Models especially for young men and I do think that the liver King type guys play an important role but again this goes back to you know the Perils of worshiping false Idols whether they be you know a liver king or some politician that is promising to save you you can't put all of your eggs in one basket I don't care you know who you're following you have to question them you have to think for yourself you have to be critical about who you're trusting like if you actually want to learn about carnivore diets in a more Primal lifestyle like look into people like Michaela Peterson that is certain Peter daughter she's actually been posting very similar sentiments to those last three commenters and just saying you know I've been on this carnivore diet for years due to my health issue do not let liver King dissuade you from learning about it or you know change your perspective about those of us who do promote it Mark Sisson is another great one I've known about him for years because my mom did a primal diet and followed his plan like 10 years ago I think his Joe Rogan episodes are some of my favorite he is also conservative he just has incredible integrity and is a really smart guy he's great but all in all my takeaway and this might be controversial is that liver King being discredited for you know juicing and all of that it doesn't mean that his entire lifestyle and what he promotes is discredited because obviously he did put in the work and much of what he promotes is you know wholesome really interesting content that I think people in

the video because i wanted to have a genuine reaction it has been killing me so i'm doing this for me but i'm also doing it for you because i want us all to be here participating and i get there are bigger issues that are going on in the world i mean nancy pelosi just went to freaking taiwan when chyna told her not to and is threatening us now but hey will smith is apologizing to chris rock so hollywood is back at it again with the distractions as a lefty in hollywood that post cancellation attempt video apology is a huge deal so i guess will just wanted to take his time with it really nail his performance maybe doing it in a timely fashion would have been better though especially since the oscars were in march and it is now august like come on will get it together but you know what will already has their stuff together epic will like they are so efficient that it literally only takes you five minutes to set up a will and that is incredibly important because guys you might be minding

leave that up to the government so if you want to check them out go to epicwill.com use promo code cooper for 10 off of the epic will complete package and yes it literally only takes 5 minutes so go check them out it is incredibly important to be prepared because the woke people are out on the loose they are everywhere we have to protect ourselves but let's go ahead and get into this video i've reached out to chris um and the mesh the message that came back is that uh he's not ready to talk and when he is he will reach out so i will i will say to you chris i apologize to you my behavior was unacceptable correct i spent the last three months replaying and understanding the nuances and and the complexities of what happened in in that moment what complexities and nuances are there to discuss the man made a joke because he is a comedian and then you walked on stage and you punched him in the face i'm gonna understand the complexities and nuances yeah okay you might have some like internal struggle that's going on but literally you walked on stage and assaulted a man in front of millions of people so save me with the [\u00a0__\u00a0] okay moving on after jada rolled her eyes did she tell you to do something no um it's like you know i'm i made a choice on my own from my own experiences okay can we all just acknowledge the fact that his voice literally just started squeaking and he sounds awkward here like we all know the jada is a piece of work i got into an entanglement with august an entanglement yes yes a relationship the entanglement even if she did tell him to do anything he would never reveal that online she would never allow him to so this is the part where i actually do kind of feel bad for will smith like he's a man man up but also there are so many men that are caught in relationships with absolutely terrible women and i feel for you because this man looks like he's being squashed like a bug okay from my history with chris jada had nothing to do with it i'm sorry babe um i'm gonna say sorry to my my kids and and my family for the heat that i brought on if this is the first time you're apologizing to your family then we have a much bigger problem like i doubt that it is but if a video public apology that you are putting on social media to get brownie points from people online is the first time that you are really making a sincere apology to your kids that's probably the bigger issue that we should be discussing now obviously i get if the kids are super mad at him and they don't want to talk then maybe that's the only way to communicate with him but i highly doubt that's the situation we've literally seen them all together since then so just saying i'm trying not to think of myself as a piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] um so i would say to those people i know it was confusing i know it was shocking um but i i promise you i am uh deeply devoted and committed to putting light and love and joy into the world and you know if you if you hang on i promise we'll be able to be friends again okay and that was it i will say at the end i mean i don't think that this is a fake apology i don't think that this is one of those like oh i was canceled for saying the wrong word and i don't really feel bad about it but i need to do it to save my career no the guy screwed up he punched or slapped somebody on stage he had some kind of you know blind rage break in the middle of the oscars he lost it like obviously if he is any kind of empathetic normal person he's going to have some kind of remorseful reaction to that why it took so long for him to do this i have no idea i really don't care i'm not trying to be the apology police here it is interesting that he said he's trying to be remorseful without shame maybe i'm alone here but i think shame is kind of a good thing it is a normal human reaction we make mistakes we are ashamed of it it is how you grow and how you learn because shame is very uncomfortable but it's kind of a necessary feeling but my takeaway is that at least some of that was real what's going on behind the scenes literally no idea chris rock sort of responded to the apology this is the first time that he's ever addressed the slap directly at all because before he has obviously made snide jokes about it people have brought it up with him and he's kind of skirted around it but this happened right after the apology was posted online and he was at a show in new jersey and he said anyone who says words hurt has never been punched in the face rock said later adding i'm not a victim yeah that [\u00a0__\u00a0] hurt mother [\u00a0__\u00a0] but i took that [\u00a0__\u00a0] off and i went to work the next day i don't go to the hospital for a paper cut which is true and badass because he's absolutely right he was a comic he was doing his job he got slapped in the face and he showed up the next day and he kept doing his comedy shows and he was unfazed and to his credit he never really slandered will smith he made some mild jokes but he could have gone out there and done this whole crusade saying this guy's awful whatever yadda yadda he's been silent i have a lot of respect for that because he's keeping his head down he's doing his work and he's letting will smith deal with whatever crap is going on at home now obviously there were some very conflicting thoughts online i mean it is literally like a seesaw it's back and forth and back and forth like somebody said watching will smith's video apologizing for that situation and i'ma be so honest with you he's a better person than me because chris rock wouldn't get one apology till this day has chris apologized for the nasty jokes he made regarding jada that night and before no he is not because he's a comedian he doesn't need to apologize for his jokes have you ever heard of humor or comedy in your life one man assaulted somebody on stage the other made a very honest and funny joke also for the people saying that we can't joke about jada's condition or whatever there are literally tick tocks of her saying she does not care about her hair and her making jokes about it so we've somehow lost communication in the middle of this about what is okay to joke about and what is not okay to joke about but that's 2022 for you somebody else said i don't agree with will smith slapping chris rock but his apology to me is clearly so genuine and sincere i'm also not really surprised the man snapped like he did he has been constantly berated by the media for years now and made a mockery whenever he was vulnerable and sad i mean this person does have a point because i think we all remember the meme of will smith crying and you might not know the context of that but it is from a video where he was sitting in front of jada where she told him the details of her affair which he calls an entanglement with a man who is the age of their son like the family is massively screwed up and it's true i don't really know if he's been berated by the media a ton obviously people took that clip and they ran with it but he's been berated by his wife there are other tick tocks where she's yelling at him while they're on live streams that kind of thing like it is a whole mess he obviously is a broken man in some capacity and i think he has a lot to work on first and foremost should maybe be getting out of jada's hair the hair that she does not have somebody said why is will smith apologizing to chris rock what is there to apologize for besides the fact that his wife was assaulted where is chris rock's apology for jada no will assaulted chris rock you fool you cannot get assaulted by a joke this entire world needs to toughen up like stop being so sensitive it is called comedy for a reason i don't know how many times i need to explain that somebody else said will smith lost me again dude chris said he'll contact you when he's ready why are you pushing him you attacked a man on the global broadcast you don't get to pick the redemption schedule and by doing it publicly you made it about you again back back bad boy [\u00a0__\u00a0] just got real that is actually a really interesting comment i would like to think that will's apology is very sincere and genuine and i want to have empathy for and i do have empathy for him but he's also a huge celebrity in hollywood and he probably had to make the video so he could you know check off that box with the mob and he also probably did it so that he could get the attention so he could re-center himself using a woke you know word in that but re-center himself in this narrative but i like literally nobody online is on the same page like it's a whole bunch of hubbub and we are being pulled into some celebrities drama that honestly should be handled between them like men chris rock is fine he shows they're still epic he's crushing it will smith got a 10-year oscar ban but he also just made 35 million on a new movie and barely anybody is talking about it so i think he is also doing fine this is probably just all for attention it is another will smith cry for help maybe i don't know he needs a therapist a therapist that will get him away from his crazy wife that is my that is my take away guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "z0IbJLa11gY": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper guys we talk a lot about teachers and the indoctrination of the school system but I have yet another reason for you to be concerned about who is teaching and caring for your children at school and I'm very sorry to do this but these people are literally Psychopaths but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to the channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection at a preschool in Mississippi some teachers thought that they would have a little spooky season fun as a way to punish some of their students who had been misbehaving I really don't have another way to describe this video you might have seen it because it was a couple of weeks ago and so let's just watch [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like not one kid is having a good effing time [Applause] monster high this has been good until they go into another classroom so she's saying she's been good don't do it to her this is how you're disciplining people three-year-olds [Music] [Applause] that [\u00a0__\u00a0] is just laughing [Music] foreign [Music] I draw the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Line in the Sand when it comes to Children these are not high schoolers and you're putting on a silly mask going this is crazy even middle schoolers these are three-year-olds I feel like there's just a general consensus in the country right now people think that three-year-olds have the emotional availability to understand that this is a joke that they have the emotional availability to like oh I'm trans I can understand gender ideology no they cannot these are children they are three years old they are being traumatized and are not being sensitive saying that look at their faces like this Society is just deranged parents are dropping off their kids four four six eight hours a day while they're at work expecting they were going to protect their children care for them and instead you're running around classroom to classroom cackling maniacally as you torment them like absolutely not somebody commented and said that's evil and going into each of their faces while they're crying and screaming that's pure evil and what else are they doing there this isn't the end of the abuse those children have suffered somebody else said my thoughts exactly what else have they done that wasn't recorded these poor children this breaks my heart God it's not my child I'd be in jail right now yeah absolutely Sam I'd rip somebody's head off this guy is just apparently a psycho and said brilliant these are the things when you look back that you laugh at how adults made Halloween really scary and fun no not at three years old I don't think these kids are gonna look back fondly on this incident and laugh and I guarantee their parents are not going to be bringing up this story and trying to preserve this memory for their children's future but actually if you guys are interested in preserving your family's memories you should try out Legacy box now I personally wish that I had known about Legacy box sooner and that Legacy box had been around forever because so many of my family's printed photos and our film photos were actually lost in a flood in my grandparents house I don't want that to happen to you guys like imagine how cool it would be if you would be able to digitize all of those film photos and film film reels and videotapes for your parents for the holiday season like they would literally love that so if you want to be the favorite Child this holiday season go to legacybox.com Cooper to redeem my special offer just for you guys again it is legacybox.com Cooper and hopefully these parents will not digitize this video for these children forever because it's genuinely horrifying my earliest memory is me being dramatized my brothers accidentally set me on fire when I was three years old when I was 12 years old this was the time when like scary clowns were huge when that movie like it or up whatever the [\u00a0__\u00a0] was the clown in the balloon came out and there were all of these adults running around La with chainsaws dressed up as terrifying clowns and I was 12 years old and I got chased down by two adult men for like two blocks my mom will completely back me up on this because she didn't realize it was happening turned around and I was screeching and running I was terrified and I was 12. imagine being three years old and not understanding what happening not having your parents nearby and everybody's screaming around you oh God oh God uh here's some political humor for you somebody said I saw an old American man sneak up behind a young girl and sniff her not much news about that oh God yeah this is just a normal thing apparently of screwing with the children that's sort of what America is known for now it's just is incredibly sad and gross so like I said this happened a couple of weeks ago it happened on October 4th and it was filmed by another preschool employee because allegedly she had wanted to talk to the owner about how these other teachers were treating the kids but she didn't think the owner would understand or believe her so she filmed this video so that she would be taken seriously and the complaints are definitely being taken seriously now thankfully because those current updates as of yesterday is that the five women involved have not only been fired but they have all been charged four with three counts of felony child abuse and one with failure to report that's when we filmed and simple assault of a minor and the one who took the video also got charged like I said but she posted this on Facebook she said I have contemplated making this post because I know I don't need to explain myself to anyone no I think you do I think you do actually if you're involved in that you definitely do but since y'all want to make me viral before you know what actually happened here I go a couple of weeks ago some girls with a daycare bought Halloween masks to scare the kids and they did it and I never got it on video the kids were terrified but if I knew I told the owner it would be a slap on the wrist for them as I've complained about other things in the past and nothing ever got done so when I heard she was going to do it again I recorded to get the proof and then the video was sent to the parents to show them how their child was being treated I did not video this for shits and giggles it was not funny to me I did not get Amusement out of this the one screaming in the faces of the kids is not me the one standing next to the girl screaming is not me the one laughing in the video is not me and then she continues on the post I don't know if that is real or not she might just be covering her ass I'm sort of glad that she's lumped in with the charges just so that she can be at least questioned and make sure that this is normal that she was not complicit and is not just trying to get out of it because all of these women are legitimately Psychopaths but she was not the only one who posted on Facebook the youngest of the teachers made a 19 minute video begging for forgiveness trying to explain herself and crying we're not going to watch the entire thing I just have a couple of moments and I know most of you will have no empty or understanding I want to give someone like me um a chance to ridding themselves or you know accept my apology and that's okay I did lose my job there and I'm at my own choice um I'll never step foot in a daycare it wasn't meant to harm anybody and it wasn't ill-intentioned I don't care if that wasn't what you intended or you were trying to do something else within one minute of putting on that mask and walking into that classroom you knew what the result was going to be and yet you continued on apparently two times going into multiple classrooms and doing that to other people's children so no I'm not accepting you're like oh I didn't mean to apology this girl is 20. she's my age grow up mature and move on like I'm glad that you got fired I'm glad you're getting these legal slaps on the wrists because this is deranged Behavior the same day this happened literally the same a GOP candidate in Arizona was arrested for masturbating in his car a few feet away from a preschool literally the same day like what the hell I don't know if there is something in the air if it was a whole astrological like Venus aligned in motion whatever those people say things are happening here's the headline it says Arizona GOP candidate arrested for allegedly masturbating in truck near preschool officials say that it is too late to remove Randy coffin from the ballot in the race for a College District board oh yeah he is running for a Community College District board he was adjacent to that community college's campus while also being adjacent to the preschool like dude none of this was a good idea whatsoever he apparently didn't know that the preschool was nearby but like come on dude you're still in your car you are gross like could you have not waited until you got home apparently during the arrest and this is written in the report he said like oh I effed up I was just really stressed I'm sorry I'm just really stressed like dude if you're stressed go take a walk go buy a smoothie all I can say after seeing both of these stories is that this Society is sick and it is disrespectful and is gross my best friend Amir actually when he gets exasperated he always goes like this planet is ghetto and that is how I feel right now and this is just all the more reason to pull your kids out of school hey hey I can't believe that you're about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "UpoHymQkv3o": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I have been going to a ton of concerts recently it's interesting because my first like six months in Nashville I didn't even try to go see live music I didn't know where to go I was like I didn't have friends yet really to go to concerts with but I feel like I've been to more than I ever have in my entire life and it's just been cool because like I lived in LA and there's tons of Music there but I just really wasn't in that scene I was not cool at all so this has been fun albeit it is kind of stressful because there are so many people around and I often get a little bit overwhelmed and like worried about stuff and just like getting there and ubering and driving all of that stuff but you know what is not stressful buying a car with Karzai because they truly make it easy whether you are an experienced car buyer or this is your first car or maybe you don't even have any credit karzing puts the power back in your hands and make sure that you have all of the information before you walk into the dealership their Innovative technology makes it so that you can pre-qualify and get all of your financing secured before you even walk in and have to deal with a car salesman in addition to partnering with these Financial agencies they also partner with over 25 000 car dealers trips Nationwide so you can truly do everything online with Karzai once you have found your dream car on carzing that's in your budget you've done all the financing all you have to do is take that voucher into the dealership sign the paperwork and you are ready to go so if you are in the market for a new car and you want transparency to the max go to carzing.com Cooper to get started again that is carzing.com Cooper and even if you do have a fantastic car I'm guessing that you will still end up ubering two concerts because parking gives me anxiety truly honestly ubering gives me anxiety too I'm just like a bundle of nerves at concerts to be totally honest but this made it all more fun this past weekend I saw a band that I've loved since early freshman year of college The 1975 and one thing about me is that I'm not like a band junkie I don't know everything about all the you know singers and musicians I will just be like oh I really like this album oh y'all kind of follow this band but I don't get like super locked in I'm just my whole music taste is very weird but anyway I've liked them since freshman year of college a very good friend of mine introduced me to them and I was actually really bummed because I wanted to be able to text him and say like this band that you introduced me to I still love I saw in concert and I went on Instagram and I realized that he had unfollowed me and I remember there were not really friends anymore for ideological reasons which is a bummer but you know that's life that kind of comes with the territory with what I do and what I talk about but anyway today we're going to talk about the 1975 because there were some interesting things that happened at this concert but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection first of all at the beginning of the concert I was very concerned because the lead singer Maddie Healy looks like he was struggling a bit he was you know chain smoking cigarettes which granted you know sex drugs rock and roll whatever I don't really care and was also like very drunk looking and he had a flask and he just kept drinking and he was like falling and that sort of thing and I was like okay this is just a little uncomfortable and it is a pet peeve of mine when you go see somebody and they are not like doing the thing that you are paying to see them do I was like dude get it together but then halfway through the con concert everything like cleared they went off stage and they came back and it was like the second act because their concert is very theatrical it's kind of operatic in a way and it really like tells a narrative story anyway he comes on stage and he sits alone at this piano and he's like doing a the Prelude to this song that I really really love called be my mistake and he stops they looked at the audience and he goes I don't know what it means to be a liberal man anymore so I have stopped trying and the audience was like what what the heck then he sings this song and then all of these TVs pop up on the stage and he eats a piece of raw meat and then starts doing push-ups in front of the TV and guess who flashes on the TV Ben Shapiro and I was like I'm sorry you they're my bosses on stage right now in the middle of a 1975 concert I have so many questions I left the concert there were some daily wire people there that I was with we were all like what did that mean like this is very weird 1975 is so lib they're so Progressive I mean just listen to their music and look at the stuff they do on stage this is interesting so anyway I decided to do some research mattah Healy even posted the image of Ben Shapiro and him doing push-ups in front of the TV these on Instagram and his caption was like the 1975 at their very best and somebody commented The 1975 at their very base people were losing their mind somebody said I'm still trying to figure out what your message is behind this whole bit but needless to say everybody was very very confused about the entire thing but it got me thinking is he hinting at some maybe based opinions or is he just you know working with Ben and the whole political right so I decided to dive into even more research first of all mattah Healy is not the most clean-cut person by any means he's always been a bit wild but I really didn't pay much attention to that because obviously he's a musician I like his music I simply do not care now I come to find out he is not only wild but people think he is problematic especially liberals which means that I am very excited and I love this you had my curiosity but now you have my attention just look at some of these headlines the 1975's Maddie Healy called out for problematic coronavirus joke here is the threat of mattah Healy being problematic there's a ton of Reddit threads about him like he apparently follows Kyle Rittenhouse on Instagram and when he did back in January everybody lost their damn mind and there's all these people being like how could he do this he's like our Beacon of like the woke left anyway stuff like that here's another headline the problematic activism of the 1975's Matt Healy basically to sum it all up this guy just does whatever he wants and does not give a crap in 2020 he got canceled for allegedly using BLM to promote his own music and for making jokes about coronavirus that people thought were out of touch and elitist he will have also called him islamophobic and sexist and racist because there is one video one that he boasted on his story where he was singing along to a song and said the n-word the hits just keep on coming they've really got some dirt on him there that has not stopped him he often posts things on Instagram that are poking fun at extreme wokism and this is all saved on his Instagram if you want to go look he put a quote and he was like I think I found the episode Center of nauseating lib memes and years like this meme you can read it me working on dismantling my internalized capitalism colonialism and understanding my trauma theory of political abolitionist lens my inner child scared as [\u00a0__\u00a0] my other inner child hopefully curious after my urge to fall back on unhelpful lifelong trauma responses and patterns and he was like this is ridiculous here's another one and he took a screenshot of this Institute of post-colonial studies is eating a settler Colonial act and he was like I don't know if this is real or the best meme I've ever seen and then he realized that it was real and it was a course being given at a university and he said kill me now this is ridiculous obviously he's kind of done with all the [\u00a0__\u00a0] I don't have time for this [\u00a0__\u00a0] I also read interviews from the last couple of years where he continued to explicitly state that he was a liberal that he was on the left but that he's tired of this quote revolutionary wokism that wasn't doing anything in the Ridiculousness of cancel culture because obviously he has been a victim of cancer culture this reporter asked if a hyper-conscious online culture and Community had created a sphere with the burden of never being able to make a mistake and he replied yeah but that's a standard thing that an entire generation is set up for themselves the problem with Gen Z is that they have set up this moral standard that they can't even live up to they're starting to realize that as they are getting into their mid-20s that's absolutely base and regardless of whether he is a liberal or not this is basically common sense and it's something that people have seemingly forgotten because cancel culture just runs rampant and everybody thinks that you need to be the most anti-racist the most woke the most politically correct at all times that's literally not possible in other interviews he has also talked about masculinity and its current failings there's a quote he said what grips the imaginations of these young men is a clear directive of traditional and patriarchal ideas and the absence of anything else meanwhile in mainstream pop culture privileged men are often praised by their stand social media users and aggregate websites for wearing dresses skirts and nail polish empty signifiers when paired with a celebrity not speaking out on political issues related to gender and sexuality basically saying that they are just playing dress-up what is being a man for men who being a man isn't some meta performance art piece about deconstruction the only form of masculinity that is celebrated is one that deconstructs it so in address I don't know what it is to be a man if you are not just deconstructing being a man and having that celebrated obviously this is like a very circular whatever but it's clear that he is questioning everything that is going on in wokism and on the left and he's making an incredible point because in Hollywood in entertainment in music the men that are celebrated are people like Harry Styles that do walk around in dresses that say the gender isn't real that it's all a spectrum that is what is celebrated and it's confusing especially for a lot of the world that just does not fall into that tiny little pocket of weirdness which then brings us back to the Ben Shapiro bit in his current tour because not only was Ben on the TV screen but he was mixed in with Mark Zuckerberg and Kamala Harris and board ape nft's Liz truss Vladimir Putin and Logan Paul and after he finished those push-ups in front of the TV he like dove into one of the TVs was very weird but another Variety article talked about that as well and they said whether the interlude was pure nonsense or an avant-garde presentation of toxic masculinity seems irrelevant to even Healy himself who went on to apologize for the black pill performance art and acknowledged that the show might be a hard sell to those who weren't already big fans of the 1975. the fact that variety is like oh it's all it must be toxic masculinity it must be whatever I don't really care but I do like that he said black pill because this man is obviously making political statements but he is not locked into some political party he's obviously making broad sweeping statements about important voices in her cultural landscape he is questioning things he is obviously pushing back against this Orthodox mainstream narrative that is running rampant basically in my opinion it seems like he's gotten tired of the [\u00a0__\u00a0] and he probably just has done a lot of shrooms he honestly reminds me of my friends back in La that would go do trips or whatever and then come back and be like Brett you're right the elites are out to get us like we can't trust the government and I'm like okay yeah you're definitely like still a liberal but at least you're realizing we can't trust anybody that kind of is what he reminds me of but anyway lastly I want to wrap this up by looking at some of the lyrics from the new songs we heard on this tour because I think that they kind of tie into this and the album's Prelude which is always called 1975. he says I'm sorry about my 20s I was learning the ropes I had a tendency of thinking about it after I spoke we're experiencing life through the postmodern lens or call it like it is you're making an aesthetic out of of not doing well and Mining all the bits of you you think you can sell whilst the fans are on that feels like he's going back and talking about gen Z again and how we have created this culture we have to be politically correct at all times I also like that he's talking about the aesthetic of not doing well which is this like mentally ill culture of like oh it's cool to be depressed it's cool to be on anxiety meds it's cool to be you know a shriveled wet cigarette man basically anyway that he goes on to say Whimsical political liberal with young people is collateral you see I can't sleep because the American dream is buying up all my self-esteem a q Anon created a legitimate scene but it was just some bloke in the Philippines obviously he's talking about again gen Z being the poster child for liberalism I love that he brings Q in there it's just ridiculous I think he's basically saying that people thought that Q Anon was some big thing but then it ended up being a random Filipino guy who I think moved back to the Philippines I'm not really sure but anyway next song this one is my favorite this is part of the band and this is towards the end of the song and he says I know some vaccinista tote bag Chic Baristas sitting East on their communista keisters writing about their ejaculations quote I like my men like I like my coffee full of soy milk and so sweet it won't offend anybody while staining pages of the nation oh yeah vaccinista is now one of my new favorite words it's such a good way to describe the covet freaks the people that literally wear have you seen the pins people wear like I'm vaccinated shut the hell up I do not care you deserve to be made fun of basically so I love that he's doing that talking about not offending anybody the soy milk stuff God it's so good and not to be explicit but I think this line is important the ejaculation one it's interesting one friend here at work thought that it was about abortions I thought that it could be because all women are basically men now so it's a woman talking about our calculations because apparently women have dicks like Dylan Mulvaney then he ends the song with this line am I ironically woke the butt of my own joke or am I just some post-coke average skinny bloke calling his ego imagination and I want to be clear about something I am not trying to claim Maddie Healey in the 1975 it's like oh we got a right wing band this is so cool because they are definitely not conservative and that is totally fine there are a lot of times when I disagree with a conservative bass and I think trying to you know bottle yourself into one political party it's often not great because there are nuances to life but what is important here is that this is an artist who is still pushing boundaries and is making art for the sake of true political commentary he is not writing his songs to appease a mob he is not writing with any political gender other than questioning things and pushing back against boundaries that people are putting up in front of him he is not cucked and I love that that is worthy of respect in this world when so many men are it's the bare minimum but you did it I don't care where you land on the political aisle at least just be brave and think critically and be consistent and find inconsistencies with your ideology and don't have false Idols that is what we need and so I'm pretty stoked about this new revelation because it just makes me love Maddie Healy in the 1975 even more I hope it does for you too thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this

"welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper so i have some entertainment updates for you today if you did not know there is a new movie adaptation of matilda coming out i believe it's coming out later this year if i'm not mistaken but the first trailer just dropped and people on twitter have some thoughts specifically this one woman who was a reporter for metro uk which is a magazine and so she did an opinion piece about the matilda trailer and you guessed it she's angry because it is not woke enough and to make sure that you never miss updates like this don't forget to subscribe to this channel like this video if you have not already and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode because the world is getting crazier on a daily basis which means that i have great content coming down the pipeline too much to make videos on basically but today we are focusing on a fat phobic film you're just mad cause i'm skinny i'm not well the film is not fat phobic but apparently the casting choices are because what is trending on twitter right now is do we really need another skinny actress in a fat suit oh my god and then there's a picture of mistrunchable from matilda so here is the article when i saw actress emma thompson in a fat suit the shame of being picked last in pe suddenly came flooding back already i'm so emotional for you so she says for the upcoming musical fantasy film matilda emma thompson has been pictured reportedly wearing a fat suit for her role as the fictional headmistress agatha trunchbull of course how else will the film industry portray an antagonist who is evil ugly and has a nasty disposition than with a slim actress in a grotesque fat suit why hello everybody then she starts attacking him at thompson moore saying and it's not the first time thompson has been pictured in a body altering prosthetic either she was photographed boasting some fake bingo wings and jowls for her role in the legend of barney thompson and it was revealed that she wore a fat suit for her role as karen in love actually i'm sorry wings in a fat suit you're trying to lump those together no she's playing a character if she's the right fit and actress for the role they will figure out how to make her look the part it is called acting for a reason you are playing something that is not yourself and then she goes on to make some big broad sweeping statements saying that it is not ethical authentic or representative of any lived experiences whatsoever because that is truly what qualifies whether a film gets woke checkpoints are not if it is representative of lived experiences you know that's the problem with the american cinema can't handle any complexity in it god forbid we have a fantasy film fantasy and magic all outlawed never again everything must be based on the life experiences of oppressed peoples in america that's how we are going to win hollywood that's also how you're going to lose audiences and money and most of middle america and it's how daley wire is going to start making lots of money because we are making films that are not like that thank you very much and listen dare i say it's good to be humbled sometimes and i think that that is something that our society could use a little more of because we are all so sensitive you know it is fine to be roasted boom roasted i actually think that that's very healthy keeps you in check makes you not get a big head everybody right now is so damn narcissistic and arrogant it'd probably be good if most of them were taken down a peg but obviously that is triggering an offensive and they are far too sensitive for that obviously that could never happen again yada yada this woman apparently has that point of view then she talks about how it has impacted her career saying that she has felt like she has had to work twice as hard to make her voice heard and for employers to take her seriously because she is the fattest person in the room i'm sorry maybe it's just that you need to actually speak louder people are not going to call on you or just give you a promotion or give you more responsibility at work just because you are fat [Music] then she just rounds it all up about saying so yeah seeing slim actresses in fat suits hurts it's fat phobic and proves yet again that plus-sized women have to work harder to be recognized for jobs that should by right be theirs my god no you are not entitled to a job just because you are fat well there's something you don't see every day you are not entitled to a job because just because you're a woman or just because you are whatever inherent thing about you you have to work just like everybody else to deserve it and earn it being able to work is a privilege and it is an honor and you should work your ass off in order to give something that is productive to society so obviously this is trending metro did a huge thread with quotes from the article and photos of emma thompson but the comments were a massive white pill i was expecting to go in and hear a bunch of sob stories from other people thinking that they were being victims whatever no it was fantastic this one woman immediately hopped in with a threat of her own and said trunchbull is described as large and strong in the story some female villains are described as skinny tall short beautiful ugly and some heroes are described in the same way this isn't victimizing you stop it and then she continues by saying christian bill's appearance and thor is yet another reminder of how badly pale people are treated by society oh good for you so good so funny literally yeah so is every prosthetic is every actor that plays a character that you know deviates from them slightly is that offensive somebody else said isn't transport meant to be muscular rather than fat yes trenchable is a what is she she's the hammer thrower she's the hammer in the olympics she's bulky she's huge tyler says but if it was cast differently there'd be complaints about how plus-sized actresses are always the villain or comedy relief you can't please everyone emma thompson is a talented veteran trenchbull is not plus size it's not a mean stereotype she's a beastly monstrous woman there we go and yes and he made a great point about how if a fat person had been cast there would be complaints about that like i said literally you cannot win they will always find an issue with something so stop apologizing emma thompson better not apologize this whole this whole production better not change anything because the moment that you start bending a knee that you start apologizing that gives them power you have to just say go kick rocks i don't care go cry in your corner and i'm going to continue doing what i feel is right another one this is probably my favorite comment bumble72 says i'm fat i don't care that i'm fat i can spread joy and love and equal to any size human people can wear fat suits if they are playing a fat person life is simple don't complicate it literally that is the attitude that we should have with everything mumbled 72 gets it i love him he is right don't over complicate it so this whole thing is just an example of a much broader trend because hollywood as i said at the very beginning has become increasingly less about acting and a lot more about having to be the exact character that you are playing i literally got cut from a job because i wasn't actually a lesbian and the character that i was supposed to be playing was a lesbian and hollywood is cannibalizing itself because of how woke it is trying to be so that is why we are going to make our own movies and tv shows that don't have all that in it and that actors can play whatever characters they are best fit for acting wise not because they look exactly like this not because they are the same body size or what like it's acting literally in the name that's as simple as it gets i don't even know why i had to make this whole video when literally we can just look at the definition of acting and you can see how ridiculous this is do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "d_3cvDEWXHk": "are you looking at me close your eyes i feel like oh welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper i think this is gonna be a fun episode i have been having to tread lightly on some topics recently not for any like self-censoring reason but just because they're kind of personal and medical like i just did a whole episode on periods basically and now guys i'm gonna do a whole episode on vasectomies and i'm not sorry about it i'm really not sorry at all but before we get into it make sure you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already go check out my merch at dailywire.com brett i hope you love the collection i have been so grateful for all the support and the excitement around it it was super fun to make so thank you all this whole channel i mean everything about it is so much fun and i i say it a lot but i'm so grateful for you all being here and i'm grateful that you all are hopefully going to sit through like 12 minutes of me talking about men sterilizing themselves because it's a trend well guys my vasectomy is tomorrow this article was at the top of twitter's trending page for a good 48 hours that's from insider news and it says meet a canadian man who's sharing his vasectomy experience to encourage men there and in the us post roe v wade his name is oliveir oliveira charbonneau i'm gonna just say that's it mr samir not going to work here anymore anyway if you're canadian you can correct me on that but he's 28 he's from canada he got a vasectomy in november so he was ahead of the trend this man was taking one for the team even before roe v wade happened but now that abortion has been made illegal it has not and the fact that he's literally in canada where all abortion is legal this man is literally just trying to get clout i'm not even into the weeds of this episode yet and i'm just going to go ahead and say it this man just wants clout he just wants attention really he just wants a lady to have sex with him we have sex with me so when the supreme court decided to overturn roe v wade he shared his experience on facebook even though he doesn't even live in this country what why are these canadians trying to get involved in american politics like y'all be happy with your trudeau if you are so angry about our politics l-g-d-p-l-g-t lgbtq2 plus quote you are not dancing tango alone so we have to share the responsibility he said encouraging other men to get one too he said vasectomy is a safe alternative to female birth control contraception is not only on women but on us men be smart and make the right choice god this man is such a  okay my first problem with that is the vasectomy is not birth control like yes you are controlling birth in a way but that's sterilization yes it's reversible but after a few years the percentage of it actually being reversible and you actually being able to reproduce it goes down after like five years it's like a 20 chance that you can get that back like imagine jumping on this trend sterilizing yourself and then wanting a kid in five years it's like when women tie their tubes in some cases you can get them untied or whatever the medical word is but that's a very very small case and according to some medical professionals i actually did talk to one of my doctors about this the amount of tubes that are getting tied in young women these days since roe v wade was overturned is skyrocketing i mean you can even see it on twitter where people are saying oh i'm talking to my 20-something-year-old daughter about getting her tubes tied because this is just a scary world you're sterilizing yourself what the hell is wrong with you people i mean i guess with roe v wade plus the climate crisis everybody is wanting to you know keep themselves from having children i don't know the whole thing is just wild to me anyway that was not his only quote in this facebook post he also said i realized that we had stepped back for the progression of the women's right we are taking a step back we're taking away rights like dude facebook is not a dating profile put this on your match.com if you're trying to get a girlfriend so badly like this is this is turning me off i don't want to date you so you're telling me there's a chance there's this quote you are not dancing tanko alone we have to share the responsibility he goes it was painless it was free it was covered by the health insurance i mean like good for you but like in the off chance that it kills you because you're such a beta cuck it's probably good to be protected which is why you need epic will because if you don't have a will in place the state is going to decide who gets your belongings your money and your loved ones are going to be hit with a massive administration fee but are we surprised it's the government they're awful they mess everything up and they take all of our money so if you want to avoid that which i know you do go to epicwheel.com use promo code cooper for 10 off of the complete will package guys this literally takes five minutes to do five minutes to protect your future because the vasectomies are getting out of hand if you're getting it done if you're getting snipped gotta be protected my boys somebody said congrats on man being a savior of women somebody responded to her and said if he doesn't have siblings he just ended his familial line to virtue signal to the world good job dude that's kind of embarrassing nobody said highly recommend the snip when you're done you're done yeah unless you're michael scott step stop stip stop step step another person said i 100 support this guy not having children kudos to him another guy said at this point if you're still following cope vid rules then just go ahead and get the vasectomy as well that was back in april but when i was looking at vasectomy tweets that one came up and there seemed to be this consensus of some people going like this is ridiculous why are you virtue signaling but there were a lot of very base people who were going listen you don't want to have kids if you are willing to snip yourself to virtue signal to women because you think that they're being oppressed maybe we're okay with you not having children it's kind of a harsh way to look at it because you know i think that starting a family is probably one of the most wonderful things that you can do i'm very excited to do that in my future and it's too bad that these people are cutting themselves off from that literally but also maybe not the worst thing but anyway there is more bizarre tick-tock trend men getting vasectomies on camera and then i see these two cucks posting videos so obviously i had to go look but before i watch these videos with you because guys we're watching them trigger warning we have to look at these comments tyler this is the ceo of the blaze he said what the explain this to me like i'm masked fully vaxxed triple boosted on my second course of paxlovid a guy responded to tyler and said men that aren't eating cake put on a bit so that if they ever do get cake none will spill on their shirt they're hoping that the bib will help them get cake but it won't if you catch the drift of that salmon literally what i'm saying it's all about attention it's like look at me i'm progressive i'm sterile you don't you don't have to worry please please come date me it's not gonna work somebody tagged discovery and said at discovery dr pimple popper is a huge success this might be too i mean listen they've got some weird shows i sometimes i'm scrolling on tick tock and i see clips from these like tlc shows and everybody's getting full medical procedures on camera so maybe this is the future also speaking of this did you guys see that hbo and vice are bidding on who is going to be able to do a reality tv show on bama rush this is a callback from my episode that i did the other day like reality tv is apparently starting on social media dr pifflepopper was just an instagram and youtube account now they have their own show literally next fall it's gonna be vasectomies on tlc and a bunch of like crying beta men with their wives forcing them to get the snip somebody else said bro they're still not gonna sleep with you seems to be the general consensus here patrick love this says it's good for humanity that this part of the gene pool is eliminating itself unvaxed live rounds are going to be the new bitcoin he's not wrong are those live rounds other people were less humorous about the whole situation there were a lot of women uh and men going i love this like you're protecting women so maybe this is gonna work out for these guys maybe they are gonna get a girlfriend after this i don't know but this lady in particular tweeted out and said if you are forcing women to carry unwanted children men should be required to get a vasectomy until they can financially prove that they could properly care for a child for 18 years hashtag snip em like these people are unhinged is this all part of population control is this all part of the great reset that we are just brainwashing people into sterilizing themselves like the government isn't even doing anything this society is doing it to themselves they are taking it upon themselves to wipe out our population i'm not going to fall for it never now as i promised we are going to watch some of the videos and we're going to cringe together because why would i talk about a video trend if i wouldn't show you and force you to be on this journey with me that's what friends are for oh god here we go i'm in no pain right now i'm walking i filmed the entire thing face up of course yeah no pinch here oh [Music] that was not nearly as bad oh yeah i thought it was going to be like i'm losing a ball i'm giving you a front row seat to my procedure no good join me so that was his preview he wanted everybody to know that he was about to release the full video and if you thought i was gonna end with that no no no we're gonna we're gonna watch the procedure video trigger warning surgery great there is light pinching yeah obviously slight discomfort not fully asleep right yeah but it's it's like it's i've been kicked in the balls worse than this you can already hear that yeah like we all have i gotcha why are you looking at me close your eyes i feel like oh the worst part of this is when he opens his eyes and looks dead into the camera as a doctor is down there like bro like nobody wanted this but this was a while ago it took me a hot minute to scroll through his tick tock to find this because for the last three weeks he has been making videos about the procedure arguing with people who don't want to get vasectomies arguing with women who are you know pro-life all of this come on what a pathetic beta cuck the man's entire identity is now revolving around his vasectomy proving that he is an ally proving that he is shooting blanks like no abortion with me ladies that's not attractive mike oh god his eyes are still looking at me all right well we have one more we have one more i don't think this guy shows the video i think he's just talking about it so hopefully this is less enticing also before we watch this there was another kind of trend that i saw in the new york post article semi touched on it but there were these men you know filming themselves face up getting this whole thing done but the majority of these videos were wives and girlfriends filming their boyfriends waddling out of the clinic or getting being on the table getting it done and they were like okay honey okay and then getting like little fruit baskets after the procedure you're a good good boy good boy like men wave some kind of flag if you need help like you were so cucked all right we had this last video this is keith i got a vasectomy a couple weeks ago and i wanted to walk you through the process just in case you were considering getting one yourself it started with a phone consultation it was super easy barely an inconvenience they set the appointment for a couple weeks out they answered any questions that i had uh day of i got valium for the anxiety uh walking in um i got local anesthesia i was awake the whole time through the procedure which was really weird but it only lasted like 10 to 15 minutes so it wasn't that bad um afterwards i basically didn't really work out for about a week the first three days or so i used a lot of heavy ibuprofen icing didn't really move too much but then after that i like was pretty good to go um and um can do everything at this point so i'm good um following the overturning of roe v wade i'm way more confident in this decision than ever um and i think that as men it's time that we start to support women and support our have our weight of birth control i know the thought of getting your nad sniffed can be really anxiety-inducing but it's less nerve-wracking than an unwanted pregnancy i would have been okay with this video until he decided to slap the roe v weight i need to carry the weight of birth control on my shoulder because obviously if there's a man who for real reasons wants to get one like he there it's family planning that sort of thing and you want to know what it's going to be like it can be nice to go on social media and go like okay this is normal but then these guys have to make it a virtue signaling thing so that they can get a damn girlfriend like guys we understand but again it's like why do i need to be scrolling and seeing everybody filming themselves from the face up getting procedures done there was a really good comment that i think spoke to me and julie said i long for the days when decent people kept private matters private that's none of your damn business and i'll thank you to stay out of my personal affairs we all don't need to be up in each other's business i'm just saying do what you want get the medical procedures that work for you but stop making it political stop posting it so i have to see you groaning when you're getting a vasectomy nobody wants that and i mean i do want to end on some kind of lighter note because there is a sort of positive note to all of this and that is that at least men are taking some sort of initiative and realizing that they can't just rely on making a girl they knocked up go get an abortion i mean if they're going to be sleeping around they might as well fix the situation it would be better if everybody just kept things in their pants and acted responsibly but maybe this is a necessary situation i just wish i didn't have to watch the videos all over my for you page that's my request my god that man hey hey i can't believe that you're about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "Rse8sOmDmSw": "foreign [Music] this is so cool all right guys we're here come on let's go do it so I've been brought out to this abandoned strip of road to test drive the god Kings McLaren what's up Michael hey Brett do you know is the god king gonna be here uh no he sent his regards but uh I think he sent

yeah thank you come on let's show you the car oh my gosh that vanity plate is awesome that is incredible who came up with that It's gotta be the god cake I've asked you today I'm gonna go I'd say well it's up to you but I'd like to see at least 120. all right hey go ahead and get in okay watch the head watch the head it's a lot smaller than Mike oh you're ready to rock and roll right now I am all right let's go all right first break [Music] is that all what if I need to wait for this everything in here is so techy it's insane like there you don't even like have to touch a parking brake it just knows I click that off like do you think a McLaren has like Apple playing or whatever it's probably way too much time all right let me stop talking I want to do this doing this for Jeremy all right [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my God you like feel that this car makes you feel like a man like I'm a woman but driving this makes you feel like a man kind of like shaving with Jeremy's razors to be quite honest I started obviously down there I don't think I slammed it as hard as I could right at the beginning I did and then I was like oh this is going very fast I think I got up to like a little bit above 100 and then I saw the flag waving immediately slammed it the break was easier to slam than I was expecting because I had been warned that it is not like a regular car but if you just like slam it down pedal to the metal it works and honestly the thing that I was worried about most was if I was going too fast like swerving whatever literally it keeps you on track it's insane the technology is wild I've never experienced anything like it would 10 out of 10 do it again probably I'm gonna go do it again so let's go I want to do it again so I'm going to see if I can reset this myself and turn it around I don't know why I didn't expect it to have like cameras to help you reverse like I'm in a McLaren Brett it's gonna have like assists that actually was not as bad as I expected that was not as bad see women can be good drivers don't listen to your friends everything's fine we're going back we're going back [Music] okay so I think I did 130. that was insane that was like actually that crazy holy crap I did 130. I didn't expect myself to do that but I was saying in the car you still like feel secure like have you guys done this before I drive a lifted car because I never want to be the smallest person on the road but I would compromise that for this switch it's just it's just wild y'all freaking done this I hit 140 this time that's all I'll say I wonder if Jeremy would be super pissed if I just drove off at this car I'm just saying like it's that sick I don't even know if I want Michael to have a chance to drive it because I kind of just want it [Music] I don't know why they needed me to set up that table it's always Michael set up the table Michael polished the car okay fine I'll do it a job's a job [Music] okay that McLaren is literally incredible and I wanted to join the contest with you guys but legal said that as a daily wire employee I am not eligible to participate blah blah blah whatever actually when Jeremy boring first gave me the keys I even thought that it might be a gift for me

detector tests and take lots of quizzes because that's basically what i do at home on my couch with my dogs so i'm just bringing you all into my personal life basically which is sort of normal at this point but anyway um one of my producers has pulled a quiz that is um can we guess your type which is ironic because a family friend i was on a walk with her the other day and she was like brett what is your type and i was trying to explain but i really don't have one and it was very confusing and i basically just gave a bunch of attributes that were not really physical but it was like an energy that i feel like i do well with um so maybe this quiz will clear things up for me i don't know which word would you use to describe your best friend uh nerd sweetheart jester professional um probably a jester i'm thinking about madison right now if you guys have been on my social media you know madison um she's like in between a nerd and we'll do jester that's you love you madison alrighty what do you like most about your job um i like my work i love my office i like my coworkers i love the money um i like my work i love what i do and no i'm not just saying that like i genuinely do um which animal might be your spirit animal definitely not an owl um mouse horse bull maybe a horse well i was gonna say i am a horse girl but i don't i get maybe yeah that fits like actually like personality wise more than the other ones although maybe i could be a bull that's me all right um what are you most likely to do on a sunday afternoon um read yes play video games no go for a hike go to the gym probably more go for a hike because i never have time to do that i don't go to the gym sorry to disappoint not a gym rat it stresses me out i don't know why i'll go to work out classes the gym finish these sentences in the mornings i'm fast asleep grumpy as a goat chipper as a bird most productive um i'm pretty productive in the mornings to be honest if i can get myself up and like get all my things done by a nice 7 30 then i'm on it i remember in college i always had 8 a.m classes because i did best in adam classes but i was a commuter at ucla for my last couple of years and so i would drive in at like 5 30 or 6 and there was a great coffee shop that always had a fireplace and it started up really early in the morning and so i would sit and i would do all my homework and my studying before my 8 a.m which is kind of a freak thing to do i know um but i was awake and got it out of the way before my day started it was fantastic so i'll do most productive uh wouldn't you say that you were romantic um i give what i get as kind of a good answer i'm not like a hopeless like everything in my life is romance and i'm not like fantasizing about romance in a way but like yeah i think i give what i get is good is that bad i don't know hmm probably that okay what kind of television do you watch most often um honestly reality tv which i know probably sounds awful but i don't really like any television that's out right now it's very rare that i find one that i actually really enjoy but a good season of you know love is blind it's always going to be entertaining it never fails and it's usually not too political so there you go um what is your most dominant facial feature are you kidding me the nose obviously guys i almost got a nose drop i did when i turned 18 i had been saving up for one and my mom knew how like much trauma not trauma i went through when i was growing up about my nose because i had friends i feel like i'm really just putting it out there now but i think it's best that i at least lay it out so then you all know but i everybody was always like brett you have a boopable nose and i had friends that would come up starting in elementary school they would just go like this to me they're like oh hi brett and like pop me in the face which is like kind of cute and whatever when you're small but it gets to a point when you're like 16 years old and you're like wow do you really think my nose is like that huge so anyway i was talked out of it because i've had friends that were like no like i actually really like your nose it's okay but i was very insecure about it so i'm just gonna say that i don't actually know if it's the most dominant but i personally think that it is okay what job might you have had in a former life mathematician that's a funny joke librarian stunned person ceo um i'm too loud to be a librarian and submersion would be fun but that's just kind of chaos maybe ceo um where would you like to go on a first date is there a gun range option um ooh rock climbing would be fun i like that that's an activity i like doing activities i think it's so weird especially when you're getting to know people even with friends like if you go on like a friend date if you're starting to get to know somebody like why just go watch a movie or do something where you're just like silently having to awkwardly sit with them i want to be doing something like i think that the cliche bowling date that's fun you eat the fried macaroni balls my mom always says that you need to take amanda home depot early on while you're dating them so you can see if they pass the home depot test so this is just my advice coming from me from diane is have some kind of project going on or like oh hey i need to go to home depot for something bring the guy to home depot see if he can find it in under five minutes but get what you need i've done it before and you just figure out if a man's capable or not just saying so i don't know why that's not on the list but anyway so for the girls do that for guys you better go be spending some time in home depot figuring out those aisles where the nuts and bolts are okay um what drives you craziest people who lie make me nuts don't like loud people people with no ambition driving the craziest yes that oh my god people seeing people shopping in their pajamas is that acceptable okay leave me alone leave me alone i had somebody like early on in the show starting to take off um i was in my pajamas at costco and somebody danned me and was like oh my god i saw you i saw you at costco and i was like oh crap damn it like i was literally in like flannel pants so no don't attack me for that okay um what do you find most attractive in others um laughter confidence thoughtfulness intelligence definitely confidence and then laughter probably next all of those are good though um are you more of a cat person or a dog person i love dogs oh my god i'm more of a hamster type person no that would be sheller that would be sheller he actually is just cat person um where do you see yourself in 10 years i'll be starting a family it's hard to say i will be traveling more i'll be at the top of my company probably starting a family that'd be nice um do you kiss and tell um i don't do anything i don't want to tell i'll never tell i never kiss and tell in my kiss and tell my best friend probably that but i do think it's very unattractive for both men and women i always hated the culture of i don't know if it's locker room culture or whatever um and i don't want to completely just you know attack guys from being like oh yeah dude like i kissed or whatever but it's like girls do it too i remember being in my sorority and everybody would come back and like dish out all the stuff about guys and often it was not positive and it was like that's just such a toxic culture and i hate the word toxic too but it's a good way to describe it it's like you're wanting these guys to treat you well and to you know respect you when you go around and you slam them to like 10 of your friends talking about whatever whatever it's just not great keep it personal i don't like you will never see me posting publicly with anybody if i was ever dating somebody it's just like especially if you have a public image it's just very weird it's like your personal life is your personal life you don't need to go expose it to like your entire sorority um okay are you more of an introvert or an extrovert that's literally not even a question um okay what kind of music do you listen to most often probably pop rock um how would your mom describe you perfection i don't know probably she would literally be like perfection but i'm not um i'm not really that serious do i sound bad saying that i'm not a slacker i'm not serious i take my life seriously but i'm not like a serious person [Music] thanks diane i'm saying that you think i'm perfect okay what role do you play in your friend group um the wise old owl i'm the peacekeeper i'm the baby and the mom well i'm literally younger than everybody so probably the baby but not in like a bad way it's just based on that that probably fits most how do you feel about first impressions um i try to give a good first impression i don't think i always make great ones i mean i'm pretty solid but you know things happen um what time of the day do you feel most productive like mid-morning time of year do you like most the fall always are you a patient person um i have patients for certain things uh what do you most like to shop where do you most like to shop for clothing walmart there we go that's like the appalachian in me um uh probably nordstrom i like i wish that there were better thrift stores in nashville i feel like i exclusively shopped at thrift stores in l.a because they're so so good but i've not had great finds at goodwill so i've mostly been shopping at the mall recently they're just kind of weird because i was never a mall person they kind of stress me out they feel so sterile and they smell weird but okay describe your laugh um probably cackling except when i'm really laughing it goes silent and i feel like i sound like a dying seal okay which flavor of ice cream do you like the most mint chocolate chip what are the four elements which of the four elements do you relate to most oh i don't know probably earth i feel like i'm pretty grounded what position do you sleep in oh my god guys i sleep like a freaking dead frog and i have for basically my entire life if you're a dancer you know the dead frog which is like a stretch like i'm face down like a leg all the way like super weird but i feel like it's also because i always had big dogs so i was like contorted around them in a way so maybe that's an answer um i see my stomach though that's oh that was more simple than i expected what kind of car do you drive economy car minivan crossover suv i drive into cv what disney princess do you like most i don't know any disney princesses yes correct all right oh you like the adventurous type all right you love to have fun you also love it when you meet somebody that shares your mindset you truly believe that you only live once and that you need someone that appreciates a good time as much as you do you are not the type to pass up a good laugh and your friends love the fun you always bring to the table oh my god thanks guys my friends love my fun um that actually is very true i get so bothered by people who are not really i'm not like spontaneous but i do like planning fun things and if i want to go do something crazy i want to have somebody that will like you know dive into that wholeheartedly and not just like jumping out of a plane but that wants to live an unconventional life i've never been somebody that's like oh i'll just do like the ordinary thing like my whole upbringing was so non-traditional and so i think adventurous can kind of fit into that box as well it's like i've always wanted to be extraordinary i've always wanted to do things like very like in a not normal fashion not because i wanted to be different but just because i think it's more exciting so that's actually pretty spot on you guys can take it and let me know what you guys get um i thought that this was gonna be a lot more about looks and that type of thing so i still don't have answers about that and i think that's kind of less important i don't really care as much about that so now you know before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribed to this channel and ring

everything that you saw over the weekend was pre-recorded i've been at home with my dogs as you probably saw on my instagram uh but i hope you guys enjoyed uh the off the clock content and the episodes that we did release but i am so excited to be back here talking with you guys uh there was a story that broke on friday i believe and i shelved it i texted it to myself and i went ahead and picked out the comments then because i was so excited about this because it involves blm [Laughter] here we go and you all know by now that blm is basically a dumpster fire they are corrupt they are power hungry and all of the leaders at the top really don't care about helping people they just care about getting rich which is what we are going to talk about today but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already or ring that notification bell and of course you can check out the first capsule of my merch collection at dailywire.com brett and my giveaway ends on september 12th so go ahead and do that now if you are interested in having the chance to hang out with me over a zoom call you will find out if you have won by receiving one of these personalized hand signed polaroids in the mail from me possibly some other goodies in there not totally sure yet but i think it'll be tons of fun so go to dailywire.com brett to enter if you have not already alright now that that's done back to the most exciting part of my day which is talking crap about the leaders at blm uh so new york post put this up uh at the beginning of the weekend and said activists accused blm leader shalom why what the hell is this guy's name all right i am going to try [\u00a0__\u00a0] shalom yeah shalom yeah shalomia bowers there we go shalomia of stealing 10 million but if you have been following the story you know the new york post was not the one to originally break the story it was the l.a times which is hysterical to me because the la times is one of the most lefty publications out there aside from you know the washington post and new york times and for basically the entirety of 2020 and 2021 i mean the blm riots the summer of love they were cucked by blm i mean so much of the publication was talking about you know police reform all of this justice we need to help blm yada yada and now they also are realizing how corrupt this organization is well well well how the turntables but of course the whole story is not as simple as stealing 10 million dollars because there is also racism involved of course because it is blm so for a little back story and to set the stage for you all the blm global network is the parent organization of all blm all of the local chapters blm grassroots all the protests there is one big parent organization they have a board and that is who manages all of the money any money that is donated goes straight up to them like in the last six months of 2020 they raised 90 million dollars do we know how that was spent no where's my [\u00a0__\u00a0] money of course not because nobody will reveal any of their tax documents and they are stealing and lying about everything so the man shalomia bowers who is accused of stealing this 10 million is a leader at the blm global network and the people that are suing him are blm grassroots so they are one of the organizations under blm global network now in response to this lawsuit the blm global network is fighting back and they issued this statement they said they the black lives matter grassroots would rather take the same steps of our white oppressors and utilize the criminal legal system which is propped up by white supremacy the same system that they say they want to dismantle to solve a movement dispute so apparently the legal system is white oppression can't believe i did not know that already thank you so much blm you're welcome so they are so upset that the smaller organizations that they are supposed to be supporting uplifting funneling money into are turning on them and holding them accountable for their actions and for stealing millions of dollars and instead of taking personal responsibility and saying wow this person that we hired is awful and stole this money they're going oh my god you white supremacists how dare you apparently accountability is white oppression now obviously if you know anything about blm this is not the first time that they have been in the news for their money issues uh and not because they are going broke well actually they might be going broke because of how much money people are stealing from them but patrice cullers had to step down because she was spending all of the donated money on property everywhere sean king is constantly under fire because he spends millions of dollars on you know private security and guard dogs and his fancy mansions cullers bought a six million dollar property as a blm basically hype house where they would make content and house blm refugees or something like that cullers also described the 990 tax document form as unsafe and harmful to black people that's interesting but that of course just scratches the surface of their money issues i mean people around the world not just in this country donated hundreds thousands of dollars to this organization believing that they were going to make some kind of change in society and whether or not you agree with their message or not when you're donating money to an organization you should be able to trust that your money is going to be used for good not going to be you know funneled into real estate or laundered or stolen i mean this parent organization did not even give the money to the grassroots to the local organizations that might actually be doing work in the communities i don't know what work they're doing i haven't seen any of it but maybe it's because they have no money because it is being stolen by shalomia somebody said all of them at the top used it for personal gain man just terrible literally could have told you that three years ago but i'm so glad that people are waking up now um cnn even reported on that i mean you have l.a times talking about it cnn reporting on it somebody said great right-wing reporting cnn and somebody else said unfortunately this isn't right-wing it is just factual some people took advantage of the situation but it's important to remember that this does not reflect the values of the movement i would love to agree with that but the blm movement might have started off as something that was very genuine and very real but it has been politicized for years now that is a fact and politics is inherently about power we're going to talk about that later uh somebody else said i guess it's nice to know that the grift isn't limited to the right yeah idiot wake up your eyes maybe this will be helpful and you can see that the people stealing your money and funneling it to people like nancy pelosi and patrice cullers and democrat elites are not right-wingers obviously there are grifters on the right but to deny that their grifters on the left is just moronic somebody else said so i have this straight blm stole from blm then blm sued blm for stealing but blm then stated it was white supremacy to sue blm bringo yes eddie teach 44 you have that correct that is how backwards this organization is i feel like maybe they are just doing all of this for press because nobody is paying attention to them anymore because we basically weeded out all of the terrible people and the grassroots organizations are failing and there's you know there's no riots there's no protest they need more money money money i want more money so they're going to get themselves back in the news but it's kind of backfiring right now because everybody hates them uh somebody else said actually one of the best scams next to covid really and somebody said better actually you're not wrong like we'll see how long people hang on to kovit and you know fauci says he's not fully retiring so we'll see if he can make people be scared of it for years to come but at this point blm has been around longer than covet and in the midst of the worst fear surrounding code when everybody was locked in their homes it was blm they got everybody to throw caution to the wind and stop quarantining and join protests in the streets so i would argue that yes it is probably a better scam than covid and much more powerful to be totally honest but this 10 million dollars is not the only 10 million that has been seemingly pulled out of thin air this weekend we're going to talk about something else now because have you guys seen this as you know the good news is in august the economy created 315 000 jobs which is important we have created nearly 10 000 million jobs since president biden took office which is the fastest job growth in history so you're asking me where is the success here it is let me finish wait hold on i will say cringe on pair she is not saying circle back like jen saki was but she does use the wait wait wait let me finish because i've noticed she obviously does not answer the question but rather than saying i'm just going to circle back and collect my thoughts later and come up with some lie to gaslight you she just keeps talking in circles until she inevitably gets to her point so she just has to keep saying wait wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on and then she talks for a few more minutes and then maybe you'll get a sort of answer that's kind of the tactic that i'm seeing from her but back to the meat of this actually have you guys ever heard of good ranchers they are my very very favorite meat delivery service and right now guys it is football season so i know they all are going to be needing a healthy supply of meat so that you can have sustenance throughout all of those games and the best way to do that is through good ranchers good ranchers is 100 an american company all of their meat is born raised and harvested right here in the united states and all of their beef is primer upper choice so that you know that you are getting the two highest grades possible go to goodranchers.com cooper to check them out you will get 30 off of your order plus free shipping and you are going to be supporting an american company that supports our values and loves the daily wire what could be better goodranchers.com cooper for 30 off and free shipping all right now we're actually gonna get back to the meat of this video where karine john pierre says that biden created 10 000 million jobs somebody said and you've spent 11 70 bazillion mick mcdollars too yeah and most of that was sent to ukraine uh somebody else said is that more than gazillion i don't really know like guys blm and kovid were both great gaslighting schemes but the biden administration honestly takes the cake they're taxing us to high heaven to send to other countries we're really not receiving any of that money back except for people who have ten thousand dollars of student loan debt that they can get paid off that's helpful the economy is tanking inflation is continuing to rise gas prices are still high the supply chain is still screwed up and they are lying to us making us all think that oh everything's great biden is the greatest president things have never been better and people are seemingly eating it up i mean there's a great portion of americans even on the left that do not want to vote for biden again so i think that their scheme is kind of falling flat thankfully over the last couple of months but still the fact that there are still people out there that think he's doing a good job is wild to me um somebody said you're creating jobs because people are having to take second and third jobs to make ends meet but we're not in a recession somebody else said all of those jobs created yet people still couldn't pay their student loans seems a little sus yeah things don't add up my friend another person said by created they mean reactivated after the panic ended yes so no you did not just create 10 million jobs out of thin air people got back to work and now they are so broke that they need more jobs and just because jobs were created does not mean that people are filling those job positions so no things are not great biden i mean listen politics is a game of power and influence and people will utilize every single crisis and spin every story and use every mode of persuasion in order to get your votes and get your money and then in the end they will steal your money for themselves or tank the economy leaving you broke and indebted to them oh me i'm poor right now the whole idea with government is to make you as dependent upon them as physically possible that's not a conspiracy it's literally happening to us every single day so really all that you can do right now is vote for common sense think for yourself become self-reliant and most importantly reject their gaslighting do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "uUqIJ_h5WZk": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper y'all I am so excited to get into this segment because we are talking about one of the show's

excited to see you all in the hoodies and the shirts Dylan who is the trans woman on Tick Tock who does like the days of girlhood whatever posted this on Thursday night and I was so excited because I wanted to wake up on Friday morning and do it as a segment on Friday but I had to wait until Sunday night for the story to really round itself out so that's why I had to do this today but anyway this is what he posted Thursday night it's day 222 of being a girl I'm in Washington DC and I'm going to the White House to speak to the president of the United States you know that phrase I fear I may have girl boss too close to the Sun well that's how I feel today because I get to sit down with Joe Biden and now this news and I get to ask him a few questions surrounding trans issues in the United States y'all are obviously wondering what I'm gonna wear to meet the president here you go it's the trans flag colors cute right it's the heels okay Dylan you're gonna be great I love you let's go just knock on the front door let's go our Queen love you I love you we're about to go is there anything in my teeth leaving on cloud nine the president of the United States gave me a cookie he gave me a cookie in the Oval Office also if you live in the U.S and can legally vote this is going to be one of the most important elections of our lifetimes Mr please get out and vote next month but vote for commentary there is so much darkness in this world I mean sometimes the bat actually outweighs the good but we have to get in the mud right now and we're gonna clean up some messes that have needed cleaning for hundreds of years and we've got to protect each other and I have your back and I really hope you have mine and I love you God bless oh no no no no thank you that is all do not need to hear any singing so that is what I saw on Thursday night so obviously Joe Biden leaving somebody with hope and optimism for the future that has literally never been heard of in the entire world that man cannot even put together a sentence that would instill anything positive in anyone two words made in America what did he say and like I said in the middle of the video my main problem with this charade with the ACT is the caricature of Womanhood women do not act like that we are not a costume we are not a personality trait we are real biological human beings and just flipping around and raising your vocal register and squealing and acting like an idiot does nothing to help us or represent us well that is my main problem here the fact that Joe Biden is taking this seriously in his watch days of girlhood no that is not a win that is very upsetting and I don't even know what he thought while watching it like did he even comprehend what was going on he probably thinks that Dylan is like some 12 year old girl that was actually a comment very similar to that somebody commented and said Dylan Mulvaney going to the White House to speak on trans issues has got to be one of the best comedy sketches ever unfortunately it's real life actually speaking of Comedy sketch it reminds me of the intern sketch that they did to get people vaccinated I actually have it here like this is the same energy and this is a guy being a parody this is how Dylan acts one sec democracy's calling hi my name is Cooper and this is a day in my life as a White House intern [Music] we did a joke actually I start off with a big coffee sorry they're like really strict in here hey Jenny I booked you a nail appointment love yeah I didn't tell you to do that it's called initiative hi White House is a scooper I don't think so oh it doesn't matter our country is a joke I can't watch anymore I genuinely forgot how awful that video is like that is something that our federal government put together I mean it is genuinely terrifying it is almost as scary as meat recalls but you know who has never had to do a meat recall good ranchers this is because their products are of the highest quality their beef is either USDA prime or upper Choice their chicken is better than organic it has no added hormones or antibiotics our Seafood is caught fresh and then flash frozen and vacuum sealed so that when it arrives to your door all of the freshness is still locked in you literally cannot get that at a regular grocery store I actually bought some steak the other night and I tried to cook it last night because I ran out of good ranchers and guys it was just Brown it was disgusting I threw it away and I was very sad because I didn't have any good ranchers in my freezer I do not want that to happen to you which is why it is so great that this month good ranchers is hosting a special October face where you can get up to four pounds of free meat when you go to goodranchers.com Cooper and use code Cooper to check out with your order this special discount code will get you two pounds of better than organic chicken on any order and two pounds of ground wagyu if you spend over 300 so don't wait go to goodranchers.com Cooper use promo code Cooper I don't want you to end up with any gross brown meat in your fridge that was horrific and it genuinely made me more freaked out than that weird intern because at least I know that that guy is fake but you know what is not fake Dylan Mulaney this is real what we're gonna watch is now real The Forum came out on Sunday night and Dylan was not the only person there asking Joe Biden questions that I think there were like six other people who were talking about big Progressive issues and they were leaders in their Arena or their specific topic Dylan is introduced about 20 minutes in though and he only talks for like five minutes so we're just gonna watch this whole thing you're with us today is still in Mulvaney who's welcomed us into her life by you know showing on social media her girl hood series let's take a look my name is Dylan Mulvaney I am a trans woman and I am documenting my transition publicly on Tick Tock for the world to see when people started watching and the numbers kept getting higher I realized quickly how public my transition would be of course I knew that there would be backlash and negativity I try to not let the internet's words hurt me or my spirit but do you know what does hurt seeing people in power in authority figures creating laws and bills that are actively trying to harm us transhumans especially trans children children we're actively trying to become not harm children actually lawmakers in many states want to exclude us from participating in sports or getting proper Health Care some folks want to decide where we can use the bathroom you know it's interesting that they talk so much about protecting people we don't want anybody to have any harm done to them we just want to keep everybody safe that's literally what we're doing as well we're trying to protect children we're trying to keep them from mutilating their bodies Do no harm it's very very simple okay anyway now don't start talking and just watch Biden in this whole thing like he's half asleep the entire time this is my 221st day of publicly transitioning I love it uh thank you I am extremely privileged to live in a state that allows me access to the resources I need and that decision is just between me and my doctors but many states have lawmakers feel like they can involve themselves in this very personal process do you think States should have a right to ban gender affirming health care I don't think any state or anybody should have the right to do that as a moral question as a legal question I just think it's wrong you know I think I was saying before we started that my son my deceased son used to be the Attorney General of state of Delaware he passed the most the broadest piece of legislation that he as attorney general even Dylan was like let's say chair the governor to sign that dealt with all gender affirming capability I mean there's a lot of you know you sometimes they try to block you from being able to access certain medicines being able to access certain procedures and so on none of that should be available I mean uh you know no no State should be able to do that in my view so I feel very very strongly that uh that you should have every single solitary right including including use of your gender identity bathrooms but public thank you thank you and it it feels like Republicans have turned trans and non-binary people into this thing to blame society's downfall on in some ways and this narrative is not only dangerous to our mental health but also our physical safety and particularly trans women of color are being murdered at an alarming rate more than any other group of people good job Joe Democratic leaders be more effective in advocating for us trans people and our families and our lives and our opportunities I'm not being facetious when I say this being seen with people like you know I mean it I genuinely mean it is it just me or is Joe Biden kind of self-censoring here like he keeps saying things and then he has to backtrack and go oh I didn't mean that about trans people I I didn't mean that like Joe Are You Afraid Of The Well radicals are you afraid as well are you one of us do you not want to say the wrong thing and get canceled by Dylan Mulvaney you seem very worried it seems not genuine whatsoever because you keep messing up what you're trying to say I mean that's actually pretty normal but you know considering the situation seems like you're pretty worried about it but anyway this is the last question do you have any messages to the families of trans folks that are seeking you know options for their children but are struggling okay I just need to stop again if you were talking about adults I would not have as big of a problem with this you keep bringing up children children that mentally cannot make these decisions children who are indoctrinated in schools children who are impressionable if you would just talk about adults making these decisions for their personal lives we could have a totally different conversation but you consistently bring children into this in order to push your agenda forward stop exploiting children for your political agenda it is disgusting we used to be able to draw the line in the sand and say the children are a protected class and now you are using them okay we'll see what he has to say but I'm just like you are an adult focus on adult issues this does not involve children this is blood of your blood bone of your bone and um it is uh again speaking to my son when he was he was spent a year in Iraq and he was a decorated soldier he volunteered to go and he had to give up the Attorney General's job then came back to it and uh he started a a foundation I'm not allowed to talk about now because I can't raise money for it any longer but it was for abused children and one of the things he did is raised millions of dollars this organization to basically educate parents as to what they should not be afraid of um and to educate the community as to what is what what is just pure Hyperbole and and uh well obviously I just think it's a matter of leaders speaking out and uh and saying as I told you I mentioned a young woman used to being his staff used to be in my staff who is now a state senator a number and she's trans and she's a you know a state center in the state of Delaware in an area that was historically very conservative the part of Delaware and she uh she's running on a pose this time so things are changing things are changing but it's a matter of us acknowledging that there's nothing to be just because it's different there's nothing to be fearful about I mean listen that answer barely made any sense and it was not really an answer to the question which I actually appreciate I appreciate that he did not go in depth about trans children and that he instead just you know rambled on about Beau and basically tried to do the trans version of like I'm not racist I have a black friend I had a a staffer who's a trans woman look at me I'm so great so I appreciate that he tried to do that so that he could avoid being being canceled but the rest of it it was just absolutely ridiculous somebody said I reckon no one told Biden that Dylan Mulvaney isn't actually 11 year old girl that's the comment I mentioned earlier somebody said trans women with penises deliver the message of Hope for the Biden Administration somebody said when was this the election is less than two weeks away and this is what the Democratic party wants to have as their primary message yes wasn't there a report that came out a few months ago that said that these big social issues that are very radical were actually losing the Democrats points and yet they are trying to go ham on them like ice don't you know that this is awful for you nobody likes this except the one percent that is invested it worked out for us but guys this is just idiotic this is terrible strategy somebody said there's a whole lot of playing make-believe going on in that video yeah let's make believe that Biden is actually mentally there another person said the left believes that men make better women than actual women yes that is because third wave feminism is toxic and not real another person said Dylan Mulvaney does not represent the trans Community they do not represent women and they do not represent girls they represent creating a carefully crafted comedy act to profit off of using the trans narrative while exploiting women's and girls lived experiences could not have said it better myself but of course as you saw in that longer video clip Dylan was not the only activist there asking Biden question so I have pulled a couple of shorter Clips just so you can get a taste of some of the other hope and optimism and knowledge that uh Biden was dropping here we go so he was first asked about abortion do you support a federal fund for individuals like myself who need to take time off work obtain Child Care the answer is absolutely but guess what we need the same votes we need to overrule that to reinstate the uh the decision that was struck down by the court I mean I do some Robbie Wade do you remember the name searched publicly urge companies to do that I've urged them publicly as president of the United States saying this is what you should be doing I urge you to do it oh my God his eyes look how aggravated he's getting because he can't even remember the name of Roe v Wade that decision that was struck down by the court he's like sitting at his chair like oh I'm gonna remember it but that's not all he not only forgot Roe v Wade but he forgot what OB GYN is while speaking to an OBG YN that woman who was asking the question is a doctor here we go don't teach you OGBYN about the health and safety relatives she is trying so hard to keep a straight face while this man is spewing utter nonsense and like becoming an agitated old dementia man I could not do it I would not be able to stay there I would not be able to sit still he also had some rich things to say about the environment that took up a large portion of the Forum here's the first clip to the industrialized world has to not only clean up our act where we've got to help these countries do what they need to do without further hurting the environment and we have to pay them in my view I have to compensate them no for what they're doing I'm sorry those are our tax dollars you want to pay Taiwan and China and Ukraine more money to clean up their acts when our act isn't even totally cleaned up no not no not in the slightest that is not our problem but that wasn't all he also said this the biggest thing is though that we have to change what we are those things that are affect the environment that was so profound that is very profound we must change what we are the things that affect environment we must change those we must do that that was that was some you know spitting true facts thereby and you really are discussing some hard-hitting policy changes right there to really make meaningful tangible movements in the environmental world just change just change the things that's great it's kind of like he's getting influenced by Kamala more and more as the day goes on he's not just like a man who can't construct sentences he's now going in circles just like Kamala the whole thing is just a hot mess the comments on the YouTube feed though were absolutely rich like they are so based I did not say one person that felt hopeful or positivity coming from that form whatever Dylan said at the beginning this person said it's hilarious how they sit there taking him seriously again I could not do that the anxiety I would feel bubbling up in me sitting there not being able to like scream at this man it would take me out somebody else said is this real life I'm seriously having psychological issues accepting that this is really happening oh it's happening because we live in the upside down you know The Truman Show whatever you want to call it reality TV that is our federal government somebody else said reading these comments gave me so much help yes exactly this because even though this stuff is coming out of the White House and Ulta is you know uplifting Dylan saying that he wants to be a mother and he can be like no sir you cannot even though all of these corporations and institutions are pushing these delusions the normal people like you and me the basis of society in this country we have woken up we are tired of being mocked and preached at and lied to and that is evident in all of these comment sections so that is a major white pill hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "Gv-AG5jBY6o": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper Avatar the film came out in 2009 and it has been a standalone film since then there has been no sequel until now Avatar the way of water is coming out on December 16th and audiences are relatively excited because Avatar is a great film and they have been waiting over a decade to get a second film it's been 84 years but director and Creator James Cameron who is super famous and very well respected in Hollywood is now causing people to question their excitement for the film and for good reason but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can follow me at I'm Brett Cooper on Instagram and Twitter for extra content I have only seen Avatar the original one once I think but I liked it visually it's stunning I feel like it was very ahead of its time I have not really thought about it since then I have no real thoughts on this other than it looks cool I'm not riveted and emotionally invested in this but you know what looks like a cool film but that's basically all Avatar is in my mind like if you want to make a sequel to a movie that came out in 2009 that basically everybody has forgotten about then go ahead do it and that's dope now on top of this coming out like 12 years too late and being a sequel people are also anticipating that this film is going to be woke especially because James Cameron is saying things like this here's a headline line Avatar director James Cameron says that testosterone is a toxin that men must terminate from their system germinated quote a lot of things I did earlier I wouldn't do career-wise and just risks that you take as a wild testosterone poisoned young man I always think of testosterone as a toxin that you have to slowly work out of your system chill out what the hell the man who directed Terminator and Aliens thinks that testosterone is toxic but your entire career is built on testosterone this is like some weird toxic masculinity versions of like reparations shut up critical Drinker who is an awesome non-cocked voice and entertainment reposted this and he said this is not filling me with optimism for Avatar 2. Elon Musk even replied to this and he said testosterone rocks not gonna lie Suraj said if optimism is testosterone then my body is completely devoid of it cat turd posted it and said now we know why I took James Cameron 13 years to film a sequel low T somebody else said he is proof of male menopause that is accurate like literally James Cameron if you are so worried about your low testosterone

made some of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all time and worked with people like Schwarzenegger I must be missing something somebody replied and said he also shot a chase scene for Judgment Day himself and defied death he beat the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of Harvey Weinstein I'll let you know if that happened I know that he like threatened to and that was a whole other deal I'm they actually fought anyway and he saved Guillermo del Toro's father from kidnappers that is true Gamo del Toro's father was like kidnapped and was held with Ransom and then I think it was James Cameron who just went and like got a million dollars out of his bank account and got his dad back back to the point the commenter continues writing and he says plus writing some of the best female characters of all time this just disappoints me yes that is all true and it is just sad the statement about the toxin testosterone comes from a profile that The Hollywood Reporter did on him last week the full paragraph reads on Titanic in the first avatar Cameron clashed with Fox execs over budgets and the film's potential to earn them back but his relationship with Disney has so far but a smooth one quote maybe it's a honeymoon phase Cameron says I don't know we'll see if the movie doesn't make money then maybe the honeymoon's over he cites his transparency telling the studio early on that if he feels something may shift about the schedule and says he respects Disney's marketing prowess it may also be that his era of F-bomb lead and shouting matches with Executives is behind him and then here's the quote a lot of things I did earlier I wouldn't do career-wise and just risks that you take as a wild testosterone poisoned young man I always think of testosterone as a toxin you have to slowly work out of his system so apparently he has been working this testosterone out of his system for the last freaking 30 years of making these epic masculine films and being this insane badass on sets I mean I say badass but he's also known to be like an absolute prick an [\u00a0__\u00a0] on set so take that as he will apparently though risk taking and passion are now toxic that is going to go well for our society because we are utterly lacking that right now that's it man game over man this game over but here are some examples of that toxic masculinity according to the post-millennial they have it all here in this little article is that according to cracked young Cameron broke into the editing room of his directorial debut Piranha 2 to recut the movie after the film's producer had him removed from the project in the early 80s he was set to pitch an idea for the sequel of the movie Alien he walked into a room filled with Executives at Fox and when they asked the young director whose film The Terminator was an unexpected success what his pitch was for an alien sequel he reportedly walked up to a chalkboard in the room he wrote the word alien and then added an s at the end he paused and then drew two lines making the s a dollar sign and then he confirmed this story in 2021 when he was creating the female heroine in Avatar apparently uh right from the start right from the beginning I said she's gotta have tits which people were very upset about on the set of Abyss he apparently got into a fight with Ed Harris and Ed Harris punched him on set he also said that he made Titanic because he wanted to dive into the Shipwreck not particularly because he wanted to make the movie and because of his interest in technology and science fiction he has always been known to be pushing Innovation pushing the bounds of what Hollywood has been able to do in a very very short time frame and he's been unwilling to compromise on that in an often very ruthless way according to many people but apparently now in 2022 he has totally you know given up that lifestyle he has abandoned toxic masculinity so we don't need to worry about hearing any more of those horrific stories anymore why none of that actually offends me those are all really funny and it just sounds like somebody in Hollywood who is passionate and he is determined to have his way and have his art produced the way way that he wants and honestly that is how most stuff in Hollywood gets done you don't make a name and keep creative control for this long by just being a doormat for Disney and fox and this whole thing is even more disappointing because like that earlier commenter said James Cameron has always been thought of as a force like just listen to him talk about how we got to start in Hollywood and it is not the traditional route at all I went straight from being a truck driver to being a film director is it true what happened yeah no kidding exactly all you got to do is stand there and say I'm the director did you go to film school or something no no nothing no I would Xerox all these like doctoral dissertations on optical Printing and film stock film emotions and all that stuff build up these big binders of like how everything was that was like a total Gearhead so I gave myself like a full college education Forum about 120 wow so you're saying your whole while you were a truck driver yeah you were just fascinated with sort of uh how they did special effects and that kind of stuff but it was a hobby for you yeah it was a hobby the fact that Howard Stern can't get over the fact that he was a truck driver Howard Stern just annoys the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of me but the elitist people sitting here listening to James Cameron be like oh yeah I made something of myself like I worked my ass off I changed my career I made it work I didn't go to film School you were a truck driver shocked go kick rocks Howard Stern you imbecile he's so weird he's also so creepy okay sorry let's continue you're driving a truck yeah how do you make the transition to be the director of how do you get on a set and was your first movie Terminator one uh I got I got hired to do this film called piranha too and they fired me after 10 days and what did you get hired to do directed directly he was just a lowly toxic truck driver just taking control of his career working his ass off like this is a story that we should be able to look back on and admire he had grit and he had determination you cannot get more masculine than his origin story at all and yet he is completely throwing that to the wind he is now a soy boy beta cuck who is working that out of his system it's interesting though because you would think that you know after this big Revelation about his masculinity he would become more docile maybe he would walk back some of those you know rumors about him being an absolute [\u00a0__\u00a0] on set wrong he is still basically a troll doing the exact same thing who feels like he has something to prove since he is releasing this film 13 years after the original came out here's a little tidbit from an interview that he did with Empire magazine James Cameron's long await to return to Pandora Avatar the way of water comes out in just two weeks and the director is using the Press tour for the movie to address the claims made by some critics and movie fans that his 2009 smash left no lasting mark on the cultural landscape quote the trolls will have it that nobody gives a [\u00a0__\u00a0] and they can't remember the characters names or one damn thing that happened in the movie he said in an interview with Empire then they see the movie again and go oh excuse me let me just shut the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up right now so I'm not worried about that to be honest I don't remember a single character's name I like sort of know the gist of the film but again it was in 2009 I probably watched it in 2012 I would say it's not my fault it's just been a long time people are not amused somebody commented and said I've seen Pocahontas I don't need to watch blue Pocahontas somebody said God I hope this bombs anyway after that interview he is still convinced that everybody is going to see it Gizmodo tweeted this out and said James Cameron doesn't care what you think of Avatar 2 he knows you'll watch it I mean that headline is just ridiculously accurate and he's also convinced the normal audiences are also going to see it twice hears about us from IGN and they said Avatar the way of waters a three hour and 10 minute long run time had some wondering how to time a bathroom break but James Cameron said that audiences go anytime they want and they can see the scene they miss when they come back to see it again you will be lucky if I even watch your film when it comes out on streaming services I truly feel like the tides are turning a bit like the box office numbers are so low for even huge Disney films like he is flailing and I feel like he is worried that people are not going to want to see Avatar and that this is going to like ruin his reputation since the original Avatar in his other films were such huge raging successes and I understand that because he wants it to work but also dude you took 13 years and now you're some pansy talking about masculinity and he's also been saying that like environmental sustainability is the most important thing to me that does not make me feel great about wanting to run and see this movie The Day That it comes out in theaters I really don't want to see some of your like anti-masculinity propaganda I got a little dick it's pathetic the Hollywood Elites they are so out of touch that they're convinced that we will all just fall into line and go see their woke nonsense endless sequels and remakes and when we don't then we get blamed because we're not Progressive enough or elevated enough to get their art start making original films again without all the political agendas and then maybe you will get your audience back oh my God how can you be like a normal person how could you how can you be one of those like lowly truck drivers thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this channel turn on your notifications like this video and of course if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper see you next time", "t7hR4Bxg5vU": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper everybody knows demi lovato and if you don't you probably do but you've just pushed her out of your mind because she's kind of gone insane over the last five to seven years she decided that she needed to make headlines again but this time it is not drugs it is not a new disney movie it is not singing to aliens i woke up in my room and there was like three beings and then and they they were oh do you want to see your planet and i was like oh sorry it is her pronouns again yes as you might remember demi became a they them last year here's the video she posted this on her instagram page last year in a brief moment when she had a podcast she has since stopped that i think everybody started a podcast during covet i mean here i am but it's post covid so i'm giving myself that i can't really say it's postcode because i literally had kova two days ago so you you get my drift i'll allow it over the past year and a half i've been doing some healing and self-reflective work and through this work i've had the revelation that i identify as non-binary so then she goes and she says that we all need to call her they them pronouns which is what most people have been doing since last year it was a huge ordeal and it was apparently part of demi's journey towards healing and self-discovery because if you also remember demi has a very serious history of mental illness and addiction and overdosing and all of that is incredibly real and if you look at any of her past you can see that she has a lot of childhood trauma that she is you know attempting to work through but maybe it's just me i don't know i don't think that changing your pronouns would really you know get down to the root of that issue that's just me maybe it worked for her actually it really did not because then demi had her little stint where she had a ghost hunting show where she's saying to a traumatized non-binary star person do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me i did an episode about that a couple of months ago and it is just still one of my very favorite videos ever other than that she has barely been in the press at all until now last month she announced that she had a new album coming out on august 19th i believe and it barely made a splash like it all i have all of demi's albums downloaded i follow her on spotify because listen whatever you want to say about the girls politics how crazy she is she has pipes like she can sing so obviously i'm going to listen to her music spotify didn't even send me a notification that she had a new album coming out like i feel like barely anybody knew about this apparently if you look at her instagram she's been posting about it a lot but that's literally the only place that i've seen it so it is certainly coincidental that this weekend a podcast episode came out where demi revealed that she has gone back to using she her pronouns that is what is making media waves way more than her album announcement is it's also like i'm such a fluid person when it comes to my gender my sexuality my music my creativity i've actually adopted the pronouns of she her again so for me i felt like especially last year my energy was balanced and my masculine and feminine energy so that when i was faced with the choice of walking into a bathroom and it said women and men i didn't feel like there was a bathroom for me basically the gist of this entire little podcast episode where she's promoting the album is her talking about how fluid she is she says that she's not really doing pop music anymore because she's creatively fluid and she's going back to using she her pronouns because she's really feeling some fluid feminine energy who knows maybe she started wearing white new balances and got into grilling she was grilling i hope she was grilling good ranchers good ranchers is of course 100 american-made their meat is born raised and harvested right here in the u.s and then it is shipped directly to your door not only does good ranchers support american agriculture but they are huge fans and supporters of the daily wire they love us they love you and unlike demi lovato they do not flip-flop on their identity and their values you see what you get and you love it so if you'd like to try them out go to goodranchers.com cooper to get 30 off of your order again that is goodranchers.com cooper this month is especially incredible because good ranchers is doing a back to school give back campaign where they are giving out a hundred thousand meals to kids in need i love this i'm getting lots of warm and fuzzy like motherly feminine energy with this maybe that's what demi lovato was feeling and maybe that's why she decided to go back to she her i don't know i get your creativity can be fluid i'm not saying you can't explore other like music genres but when it comes to your gender figure it out or you don't and leave all of us out of it i'll need to be pulled in a bunch of different directions because a new celebrity has decided that they are identifying in some different way depending on the way that the wind blows it's exhausting these people need to get a life that's all i'm saying the gist of it is that she was feeling more masculine and androgynous last year but now she's back with her feminine energy a lot of people on the internet were claiming that she had now totally abandoned they them and was no longer non-binary she hasn't done that exactly yet like daily mail posted and said demi lovato admits that she is no longer using they them and reverts back to she her it looks like she is just slowly adding the feminine energy back into the mix if you look at her instagram she now has all of the pronouns listed first of all her profile picture is just so scary says demi lovato they them she her i don't know if that means that she isn't non-binary anymore or if she is just non-binary with a little bit of a twist my personal opinion is that she's gotten over this moment in her life but she didn't want to completely abandon the non-binary label for fear of backlash from that community oh my sweet summer child what do you know about fear i saw this post on reddit it is from the r slash non-binary subreddit and somebody says about demi lovato this is just a couple of days ago just heard that she changed her pronouns back to she her after a year of being non-binary she said she just wants to feel human and that recently she's been feeling more and more feminine again help me figure out why this feels disrespectful to the community or am i being disrespectful by questioning why she flipped back and then she says edit thank you lovely humans i appreciate that people are allowed to try things and find out what is and what isn't for them i guess that even high list celebrity struggle with gender identity and have to move through their truth to find it so apparently because this person questioned this they got slammed in this subreddit and had to put in that edit here's another response that they said which got removed by the moderator they said thank you this puts it into words better than i could have it does feel like she made a big commitment announce it in the news did various interviews about non-binary representation and then a year later she drops a non-binary because she wasn't feeling it i get she's a fluid person but it really leaves such a bad taste in my mouth that she made such a huge deal out of it only to revert back but yeah people are people and are allowed to experiment to find their true identity it just doesn't help that she was writing the non-binary hype train so publicly you know it's very confusing because i kind of agree with this person because it all feels like some sort of publicity stunt and in a way i guess that means that i'm sort of supporting this non-binary subreddit because really i feel like all of these celebrities are just doing this for attention because it is trendy at least they are not a-list celebrities swaying back and forth depending on what is going to get them the best you know pr clicks or whatever and it is just such a perfect example of how you can never be woken up and you can never question the narrative because the left will always eat its own this person that is literally a non-binary person in a non-binary subreddit is simply just posing a question and got absolutely ripped apart in this subreddit demi lovato is probably worried about becoming a girl again because she's going to get ripped apart by the non-binary community literally here like you can't even do anything right anymore political correctness is a cancer online obviously there was a lot of energy over the pronoun change on instagram people just seemed over it in general like somebody said everyone should use dude dude the universal pronoun um somebody said whatever keeps her in the headlines yeah literally another person said demi changes pronouns as soon as people stop talking about her i'm glad people are catching my drift somebody else says i was really enjoying calling her femi i like that that's good but it was interesting because on twitter when i typed in demi and i was kind of looking at the trends most people were defending her like this person said the way the media just blatantly twists demi lovato's words for headline clicks is so weird because demi has never said that they stopped being non-binary or dropped they them pronouns they just said that they added she her again because they are a fluid person what is not clicking another person said demi lovato was completely valid in her search for identity gender is not black and white why are people mad other people were pissed off by this tweet from blair white who is transgender she's good friends with joe rogan and alex jones that whole crew blair said demi lovato is now de-transitioning which for her means switching pronouns again many kids she helped misinform about transgenderism are not as lucky and won't make it out without missing body parts i get why some people are upset about this tweet because demi isn't really fully de-transitioning she never became you know transgender but she is backtracking and blaire white is making a valid point and she's addressing the earlier comment of why are people mad they are mad because she spent a year going around parroting gender identity and non-binary talking points to her fan base and pretending like that transition to gender fluidity would solve all of her problems and suddenly she was like a healed human being but news flash it didn't like it usually does not because people who often change their gender identity or explore all of this whatever all of the pronouns are often people who are seeking some kind of healing and they are thinking that they can you know get it from this trendy solution it really does not work that way you need to get to the deep rooted issue is all i'm saying but lucky for demi she did not chop off any of her body parts or hopefully not take any you know irreversible hormones but impressionable young people who listen to her and look at all of these trends on social media and see this you know gender identity craze might not be so lucky they won't be able to backtrack so easily and that is what is so terrifying about this entire thing we have no idea what might happen in 20 30 years to all of these kids that have literally been chopping up their bodies that is why people are so upset it's also you know a more dangerous version of how kids used to you know become goth or emo or whatever but back in those days people weren't taking medicine and chopping off their body parts in order to fully be goth or whatever now people are literally changing their gender because it is trendy and it is cool and they think that it is going to solve all of their problems and back in those days this wasn't validated by the medical world by celebrities by their parents by society by social media it was a phase that you went through and then you know you worked through it you fixed your problems later on you went to college you got a job you had a family demi might be able to go back and forth and flip-flop because she's a celebrity and she can do whatever she wants but other people they can't and that's what's dangerous do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "HvDyFJhbp7s": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper you know some big things were happening on the internet last night joe rogan decided to drop a surprise episode of his podcast joe rogan experience with mark zuckerberg this surprise episode is also three hours long and people are already watching it they are already commenting on it but there is one specific thing that zuckerberg talks about that has everybody losing their [\u00a0__\u00a0] for very good reason but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode and you can go check out my merch at dailywire.com brett i'm getting so good at saying that i feel like i say that as i'm falling asleep at night to be honest all right so here's the clip that is going viral basically the background here is the fbi i think basically came to us some folks on our team it was like hey um just so you know like you should be on high alert there was we we thought there was a lot of russian propaganda in the 2016 election we have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump of of um that's similar to that so just be vigilant so our protocol is different from twitter's what twitter did is they said you can't share this at all we didn't do that what we do is we have if something is reported to us as potentially misinformation important misinformation we we also have this third-party fact-checking program because we don't want to be deciding what's true and false and for the i think it was five or seven days when it was basically being um being determined whether it was false the distribution on facebook was decreased so there you have it it is confirmed both twitter and facebook are enforcers of government's deep state authoritarian agenda like i mean what companies can you even trust anymore well actually i do know one nimi skin care because unlike facebook and twitter nimi's skin care will not bow to the progressive mob in order to make a political statement because they know that they should stick with what they do best making skin care and let me tell you it is literally the greatest skincare i have ever used i've been using it for almost nine months now my skin has never been happier i use their daily glow-up routine i literally cannot recommend them more so if you want to try them out go to nimmieskincare.com and use promo code cooper at checkout for 15 off you will not regret it literally and especially for the guys a little moisturizer try it you'll love it my god what i really appreciate about this is that zuckerberg is clearly out of his element he's like oh my god why did i do this why am i here and rogan is probably high out of his mind like censorship let me let me just ask you these questions like he looks so unbothered and is desperately trying to be so casual as he is asking these literal bombshell questions that people have been fighting over for the last three years so immediately after this was posted it started getting traction like i said it has 8.3 million views now people on all sides of the internet are tweeting about it but obviously it has more of a presence on the right wing side of twitter somebody said joe rogan is about to be canceled again for having the ability to convince zuckerberg to admit how corrupt the fbi is by just having a casual conversation with him exactly it's incredible another person said i'm no joe rogan fan but no one should have to talk to mark zuckerberg for three hours that is relatable the man is a weird alien freak i'm just saying another person said you know you're living in an oligarchy when mark zuckerberg has more political influence over your country than any elected official yes and when unelected government agencies have more power than any elected official like we are not being represented by the people in dc we are getting toyed with by random government agencies like the fbi and the doj and the atf and all of that crap who are having massive government overreach and just toying with our lives basically another person said i'm going on record saying that zuckerberg didn't kill himself yeah watch out you're about to get killeried by the fbi my dude just saying we came we saw he died but obviously as you saw in that video he was trying to cover his own ass and switch the blame onto twitter because rogan mentioned twitter and he was trying to be like well we censored but not it's not as much as twitter no they did totally different thing so a lot of people started picking that up as well so new york post who is the first one to break the hunter biden story uh tweeted out and said mark zuckerberg criticizes twitter's handling of the post-hunter biden laptop story which cracks me up that that is getting the media attention but i kind of appreciate it because it was quintessential blame shifting yes twitter is bad but facebook and instagram are god-awful you can get kicked off with no explanation videos get demonetized literally every day they will suppress you in the news feed like you said like they are just as bad as twitter i'm going to say it somebody replied to that and said i'd suggest a steel cage match between zuck and jack dorsey but that would end as soon as one of them broke a nail and the thing is weirdly jack dorsey has been not really based but has you know said some common sense things since leaving twitter it's like once he got out of that bubble he's been able to say like oh yeah we kind of we didn't do some great things i don't really agree with that it's like dude maybe you could have had the balls to say that and acting according to whatever you're saying your values are while you were the ceo of twitter that would be great okay but i digress now that we have confirmation that they were censoring and suppressing the story during the 2020 elections i think it's important that we just you know shine a light on what they are currently censoring because now we sort of know what these systems and processes look like behind the scenes prove it so the story that is in the hot seat right now conveniently right before the midterms is the validity and authenticity of ashley biden's infamous diary now ashley biden is biden's 40 year old daughter and she has a diary that has been making the rounds in the media project veritas got their hands on it and then they got raided by the fbi to get it back people have said that it is false that she never wrote it it's not a real thing but its validity and its authenticity was just confirmed by both the fbi and the doj that's not true and we know that this is authentic because the two individuals who stole the diary and then sold it to project veritas to begin with are now being prosecuted you're a lion dog face pony soldier and even the new york times is willing to admit that say the florida pair pleads guilty in theft of biden's daughter's diary amy harris and robert kurlander admitted to participating in a conspiracy in which ashley biden's diary ended up in the hands of a conservative group project veritas near the end of the 2020 campaign ashley biden's diary it is a real thing so what james o'keefe had his hands on when everybody was slandering him saying you don't actually have her diary but i didn't actually do those things to her no that was all true but what all of these media outlets including the new york times will not discuss and what we are not allowed to talk about on social media are the contents of this diary which ashley biden allegedly wrote in 2019 while she was in rehab and if you want to know why they're censoring it let's just read these lines where she is talking about her complicated relationship with sex we have this highlighted in red she says was i molested i think so i can't remember specifics but i do remember trauma and then later she says i started having sex with friends at a young age and had showers with my dad probably not appropriate so she is speculating about being molested we don't know if she's referencing biden or somebody else in her family some other person but then she talks about inappropriate showers with her father are we shocked that big tech is suppressing this are we shocked that the fbi did everything in their power to make the masses think that this was not real no not at all i mean if you have had any doubts that big tech is simply an arm of government in 2022 this is your proof i mean why the hell did biden even need his disinformation governance board when he has the fbi and the doj telling facebook and twitter what to suppress and censor in order to protect his image i mean yes twitter and facebook and instagram are all private companies and many believe that that allows them to ban and censor all that they want but they are literally bought out and cucked by the government that is a different conversation they are not private at that point especially not when mark zuckerberg is donating 400 million dollars to biden's campaign to protect his image across the country [Music] their arm and arm they're doing this together so don't tell me that they can just do whatever they want because it's not that simple guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "oMxPx-m68B4": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper today we are talking about John fetterman I have seen your comments you have said Brett why have you not talked about him yet have you seen those gaps it's basically like Biden 2.0 I know I know but you know what we're almost at the midterms now this seems like the perfect time to dive in and now we have like an entire campaign of content to review now if you do not know who John fetterman is he is running for Senate in Pennsylvania against the well-known Dr Oz who's running as a Republican and his campaign has garnered a lot of attention and not just because he has that every man stick where he exclusively wears Carhartt hoodies to literally every single event and basketball shorts it's an interesting thing but instead it is because of what many would call some cognitive instabilities and the fact that his wife might be taking advantage of him now before we get into this episode make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and I know you thought I was going to talk about merch I actually have a different favor to ask of you guys today so we're doing some planning for next year and my team and I would love to get your input on advertisers that we have on common section what brands you would like to see me talk about what you want to hear from me we have a survey that I'd love for you guys to fill out it will be linked in this description for this video and it'll be on my Community page it'll literally take like two minutes to do I want to make sure that I'm promoting things that you guys are interested in and that you like so go fill that out and we'll make sure that we have everything prepped for next year let's get back into it now John fetterman is not new to the political scene he was a mayor in Pennsylvania for many years he's been the lieutenant governor and now he is running for Senate however fetterman had a stroke in May and he took a couple months off from his campaign but he and his handlers most likely his handlers were determined that he finished the race and that he continue running and it is not going well like at all just listen to some of these recent Clips they show what's going on better than I could ever say what do you think the biggest cause of inflation is and should the Biden Administration be doing more no I I just do I I think that that simply is also we have this talk about the trillions in in massive tax uh tax uh cuts to the corporate uh tax structure as well true you know trillions of dollars that have added to the deficit and and now they still want to support those as well true I think in terms of being very serious about addressing inflation is is making sure that those rates are brought back into a line with what they they should have been uh where they're able to uh fight uh the the the deficit summer of 1986. I uh everyone that ever plays I'll uh football in in high school was you know at a kind of like a trade -up kind of um football camp there is that 2018 interview that you said quote I don't support fracking at all so how do you square the two I I do support fracking and I don't I don't I support fracking and I stand and I do support fracking what when listening to that imagine that is what non-english speakers hear when they're listening to my channel why is this girl babbling nonsense at me in this random language sorry I don't speak Italian it sounds like he is doing the Sims language I did that episode about simply that I expose that I have played Sims the only thing that I clearly got out of that is that to address inflation seriously we need to bring the rights down well well if it's that simple let's just break them down let's just hold those that does not work that way so not only am I concerned for his like actual cognitive well-being because this man has had a medical emergency but also do you even understand how the economy or how inflation works I really don't think so and those two combined it's not a good combo he probably has CTE that could also be a cause of this but he can't even pull any thoughts together he cannot complete a coherent sentence he's taking a long time to answer the question because number one he has auditory processing problems he also has speech processing problems where he just can't get the words out meanwhile I don't really know if he knows what he's saying this is somebody that people in Pennsylvania want to be representing them in DC they are so terrified of Dr Oz and like you know listen I don't really like Dr Oz either but they hate Republicans so much that they're choosing to vote for him and I have a problem with the established Democrats that they chose this guy to represent them even after he had a medical emergency they're like ah it'll be fine will it I don't think so it's more sad than anything else the people are still pushing for him that they are putting him up on that stage when he should be resting and getting better and spending time with his kids because mentally I don't think he's there imagine having him and Biden and Kamala in a room together that would be absolute hell that's a nightmare for me I mean at least Biden and fetterman have like legitimate incredible health issues I think Kamala is just an idiot but the other two like I actually feel sad for them but that has not stopped people from comparing him to Kamala somebody said he must have stolen that one from kamla that was about the inflation where he said let's just lower the rates I can imagine her cackling after that somebody else said I want him to win so if he and Biden can have to talk to each other and we can get that on a hot mic yeah I um I would love that from my own personal content and enjoyment but I don't want that for the country that would be an absolute train wreck yes yes great point now let me just fire up the five translation apps I have running and we'll again it seems like a different language another person said I do feel bad for him I remember seeing him on the news as a kid and he seemed like a pretty likable guy with a strong personality now he looks like a shell of his former self this man has been in government for a long time I don't care that he's a Democrat we need Democrats and Republicans and independents in all of that jazz I care that this man is not mentally stable and they are pushing him out in front of everybody when he clearly needs help somebody else said I wish him a full recovery but he is not fit for office some said it perfectly it's cruel and it makes us Americans look like fools like I can't even take his platform policy seriously or even understand it for that matter because he is unable to communicate it or even work through his thoughts he literally uses computers to answer questions NBC had to approve that for the debate with Oz when you see him pause for a long time before answering it's because he's reading what the person has just said correspondent Dasha Burns even confirmed that after they did an exclusive interview together here is a clip from that he's reading off the computer in his home can voters stress that you will be able to do this job on day one yeah of course now according to her after the interview she gave a quote and she said you'll see in the clip that I'm about to play he has a screen in front of him and that he is transcribing my questions as I ask them he's reading those questions and once he can read he can fully understand what I'm asking and he's also still suffering from some of those speech challenges he's doing speech therapy every day his campaign says he's still recovering and I'll tell you we've been to several rallies since the stroke and it does seem like he is improving every day that seems like a pretty positive quote she's not saying that he is totally unfit she's just acknowledging the fact that he needs assisted and people attacked her saying oh you're so ableist how dare you run this hit piece how could you do that it is not ableist to be concerned about a candidate's cognitive state or to have transparency in how he is going about conducting interviews and debates that is something that voters have a right to know now that I'm thinking about it like reading off of those screens all day long is probably not good for his brain I bet that he could benefit from some boncharge blue light glasses to help with that eye strain I actually have my pair right here Bond charge is an incredible Wellness brand that has a huge array of products to help you have more energy balance your hormone Islands recover faster reduce eye strain you name it they have a product for you but out of all of these products the one that I rely on the most are their blue light glasses these are made in Optics Laboratories in Australia and they are actually backed by

off your order again that is boncharge.com Cooper promo code Cooper at checkout after doing this ad read I really feel like I need to send a pair of these glasses to fetterman because it really is sad like I don't dislike the guy I just feel bad for him this is not the case of somebody who has a disability has overcome that is thriving is killing it this man is still recovering he needs rest he needs care I believe that he is being used and it's totally fine if you need assistance if you have a disability but I mean this man is wholly relying on this and this isn't just the case of somebody who might have hearing problems and need a hearing aid or need additional assistance this is that plus a candidate who seems like he does not understand his own policy cannot communicate effectively at all the things that he is supposed to be promoting and representing and helping people with somebody commented and said I'm not going to make fun of him that's classless those that continue to think that he should be a U.S senator and are still going to vote for him should be ashamed of themselves you are an embarrassment to the country and are the problem but it's not just the voters it's the people that are pushing him to do this because I do think that he is being used like Biden by his family and by the establishment who knows that he is a palatable every man candidate for Pennsylvania he kind of represents the old Blue Dog Democrats but with a radical Progressive agenda and because of his weak mental state he is easily controlled which is what they love his wife I believe is an important part of this her name is Giselle she is an immigrant from Brazil they have been married since 2011 I believe I think they met in 2008 I'm not sure she has spent the last decade working alongside of him doing non profit activist work in Pennsylvania here's her bio from his campaign website meet Giselle Giselle fetterman the second Lady of Pennsylvania or she prefers slop is a trailblazer in her own right born in Rio De Janeiro Brazil giselle's mother took her and her younger brother to the United States when she was seven all of them undocumented immigrants they lived in a one-bedroom apartment in New York City and were teaching themselves English while her mother worked cleaning hotels and houses after 15 years of living in the shadows Giselle received her green card in 2004 and became a United States citizen in 2009. also an important Point here Giselle has shamed Dr Oz for not being from Pennsylvania and she you know talks about how like she and fetterman are true pennsylvanians like lady you came from Brazil you lived in New York City then you moved to Jersey you still have a New Jersey area code she's like Jersey in every sense of it here's another picture of her doing her activist work here's some pride stuff all of that and she really is like a younger Latina Jill that's really the only way that I could put it just look how she intervenes with fetterman Mr fetterman are you satisfied with the progress of the bridge [Music] we're not taking interviews we're here to celebrate meanwhile fetterman's like did not even acknowledge that there was a reporter there has no idea it's like Biden when he gets off of the podium and goes oh do I exit this way or this way and Jill's like help these sad unhealthy men are being controlled by these women I mean even Biden thinks that she is control I don't know why I said even Biden because I don't really think he's thinking about anything but he believes that she is the one in power Ron and I really do appreciate it and Joe you're gonna you're gonna be a great uh a great lady in the center he didn't say that fetterman's going to be a great man in the Senate that he's going to do a lot of good things but Giselle you're gonna be a great great lady in the Senate behind the scenes pulling those strings because he knows how it works because that's what's happening in his presidency every single day Kamala and Jill back there ooh pulling the strengths It's upsetting it's wrong it's elder abuse and guys just so that you are warned I don't think we want to live in a world where Giselle is a senator because she holds opinions like this you know historically um swimming in America is very racist and usually when you look at drowning statistics it usually affects children of color because of lack of access I took offense to that swimming is racist how do you how how now obviously people who are lower income might not have a pool in their backyard but there are community pools and obviously it's a different situation if you are a parent that never learned how to swim but if you want to protect your child if you're going to have them around water you take responsibility you figure out how to swim and then you teach your kid and you take care of that because that is what a parent does do not blame it on racism that's just ridiculous the Santa says press secretary responded to that video and said nothing more relatable than this entitled clout Chaser being chauffeured around in a taxpayer-funded SUV and lecturing us about how she is a victim of racism literally it's just ridiculous another person says oh my God if fetterman gets in she shall shortly take his spot buyer beware another person said that is the de facto candidate to you sir yeah it's not going to be like first lady Senator Giselle it's about to be Madam Senator Giselle and I'll say it once more just to drive the point home no matter what the people say on Twitter or on Reddit or on Tick Tock screaming at people who hate fettermen it is not ableist to be concerned about the cognitive health of an elected federal official it is not ableist to call out behavior that could be harmful for him and for this country and that's not just because we are on different sides of the political aisle this could be detrimental for the people who are voting for him to represent them but I also have to say now that we are you know on the topic of political parties why is it that the establishment Democrats are pushing candidates like this like Biden who clearly have health issues I mean I know the answer it's because they are easily exploited and controlled and that should tell you a lot about their agenda and about what they want but as Americans regardless of our political affiliations we deserve intelligent and capable Representatives not this not Biden it's not just bad for us but it is bad for them it is just morally wrong and they need help thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this channel turn on your notifications like this video and of course if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper see you next time", "-C1SzpBt4s8": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper guys we literally just talked about aoc on this show two days ago and yet she has already given us more content because truly this woman just lives to be in the spotlight when all of that stuff with alex stein99 was going on she tweeted that he was just somebody looking for extremist fame no i'm sorry aoc you are the one looking for extremist fame but before we get into it you guys know the drill make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode we have surpassed 800 000 subscribers which is literally insane because i think we hit 700 000 maybe three weeks ago actually i know it was over fourth of july weekend and we have not even left july yet you guys are wild i am so so grateful thank you for being here continue sharing the show and being here commenting i have tons of fun doing this so it's a wild ride but i'm happy you guys are here all right what is even more wild is this story that was so cringe but i really don't even care so yesterday there was yet another abortion rights rally outside of the capitol because they are not tired of screaming about killing babies yet maybe one day they will be i highly doubt it but anyway many many democrat leaders were in attendance because obviously instead of doing actual work for their constituents they want to protest and make a spectacle and then text you asking for donations i am looking at you senator warren anyway the demonstration started to grow and police had to get involved and start clearing the roads here is some footage from the event aoc there you are my queen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's just chaos [Applause] first of all aoc is just having her vocal moment really leaning into the chant whatever band thing is going on they are off-key off tempo they did not coordinate this whatsoever i'm also enjoying her outfit she is in a winter coat in the middle of july that seems like a bad decision but anyway i digress the capitol police posted this on twitter they said demonstrators are starting to block first street it is against the law to block traffic so officers are going to give our standard three warnings before they start making arrests they continued in this thread saying you know the three warnings have been given we're going to start clearing we've arrested this many people so their final one was correction we made a total of 35 arrests for crowding obstructing or incommoding dc code whatever uh that arrest number includes 17 members of congress but right as this was going on this video of aoc getting escorted out of the demonstration popped up online here we go she's walking [Music] gotta get her light [Music] classic fists in the air so that has 8.8 million views miss aoc you are getting the extremist fame you are putting yourself right in the spotlight but let's just you know break down this video quickly she is not even handcuffed she is walking around pretending like she is flipping her hair for the perfect angle getting that light she looks so smug i mean she is literally as fake as vegan meat which is why you need to try good ranchers they are actually real they are 100 american grown and they don't subscribe to this woke bs goodranchers cares deeply about providing american families with high quality meat at a reasonable price and moreover they love daily wire they sponsor all of our shows they are huge fans and we love them here and so i have gotten a great deal for you so if you would like to try them out go to goodranchers.com cooper and you can get 30 off of your order plus free shipping and i want to see what you guys are making so if you order good ranchers post it on your story on your instagram tag me and goodranchers in it we are excited to see what you make i personally made both chicken and steak this week and i am very excited for my next box to arrive so i will keep you all updated on what i am cooking because i love real things which is not aoc getting handcuffed look at the end of this video once she gets her little photo op with her hands behind her back she turns to the other cameras to the other side of the people she raises her fists she does the blm social justice warrior whatever pose for another photo op now obviously you don't have to get handcuffed to get escorted out by the cops to get arrested and maybe he just told her hey keep your hands behind your back keep them visible but come on like it is such a media moment it is literally the fake tears at the fake border all over again and everyone immediately started calling her on her [\u00a0__\u00a0] which i was very happy about someone said and yet she managed to shift her hair back into place and keep that smug smirk on her face the entire time i only hope i could be that brave just once in my life me too james me too stunning and brave this person says i wonder if she'll pretend to be strip searched dear god another guy says i'm surprised she didn't just claim that she was killed by the police yeah literally i mean it's going to be her january 6th performance all over again [Applause] you were murdered okay you obviously weren't murdered because you're alive and you're basically intact and side note for someone who claims that they hate the police so much she seems to be pretty happy being walked out great for her brand apparently especially since literally three days ago she called the capitol police five times because alex stein trolled her so figure out your messaging aoc people online then started saying that the cop who's arresting her you can see him in that video resembled suraj hashmi who runs the infamous list on twitter and he took that and ran with it timpool first said uh is that suraj hashmi arresting aoc he then retweeted one of the pictures and said you're welcome and then he changed his entire profile he is now suraj hashmi sheriff of sharia he put tim's comment behind him he changed his profile picture to be the cop with aoc it's kind of iconic and then of course because their stories are so intertwined the greatest love story people brought alex stein into it because obviously aoc is his favorite big booty latina somebody said where is alex stein99 when you need him and he commented back and said on my way to the courthouse to bail her out and then he retweeted the video of her getting arrested and said don't worry baby i'll bail you right out of jail and then people started taking the video of him trolling her originally and put it over her arrest video so it was like my favorite big booty latina and she's like walking away waving getting her photo op moment the internet is just a a beautiful place it's just beautiful they also photoshopped his face on the cop arresting her just endless memes i love it but there's more to the story aoc was not the only one there like capitol police said 17 members of congress were arrested 16 women one man and they also created their own kind of spectacle here's ilhan omar apparently arresting and escorting herself out of the protest so there's aoc walking she got the fist up all right there we go what is she doing like i'm just gonna i'll take myself out goodbye she's also not in handcuffs because end of the video she lifts her fist so this is just ridiculous she sadly did not get her sheriff's raj escort out of the protest but by golly she was going to get her photo up if it meant that she had to arrest herself which apparently she did she also is not handcuffed like i pointed out when we watched the video because at the end she raises her fists but the reporter who posted this asserted she was it was breaking she was arrested you are fake news yeah and she had to issue a correction like five minutes later because everybody on the internet was going i'm sorry are you daft and they wonder why we don't trust the media thank you very much you literally just exposed yourself now last but not least this was the one congressman in attendance rap andy levin i think he's from maine and just watch this [Music] so this is just a short video showing him talking to the press the caption says as protesters wait to leave rep andy levin tells gathered press that the senate must abolish the filibuster and force through abortion legislation so they're all saying right now but just look at what he's done with his pro-abortion bandana does he look familiar to you i'm prison mike it is literally prison mike and thankfully i was not the only one who realized that somebody took a screenshot from another angle and said the worst thing about prison was the dementors now in addition to the countless screenshots of prison mike somebody else had a different opinion and said why is he in an elf costume somebody else said produced reality tv show i say this all the time but politics truly is reality tv it is theater it is whatever you want to call it it is produced for our outrage and our entertainment because they do everything for show and this was the democrats but it's on both sides of the political aisle nobody is excused from it except rand paul i love you rand paul you do no wrong in my eyes and it makes sense because it is how they get media attention so that they can get more donations they can get more votes they can get more expensive speaking engagements they can get more book deals whatever yada yada it's all a game to them and i don't know if we can change that anytime soon so the best thing that we can do is just be aware of it attempt to hold them accountable vote them out and the best thing is to be able to laugh at it because if we're not having fun if we're not laughing at all this ridiculousness it's just going to be depressing and we're going gonna feel like we have no power and there is no hope so at least we can find some comedy at least there is content for me and i get to keep my head above water because if not i would probably be very sad that these are the people that somehow we have elected to represent us so let's just focus on voting the reality tv show stars out that would be a great first step do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "PPmCxKJomw8": "I always have felt like the girls and I hated being separated because I was one of the girls you were one of the girls because you were gay why can't people just be gay anymore welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper guys we are basically doing a part two of a story that I did back in September August back to school era we're talking about Grant Sykes from the University of Alabama but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper Grand Sykes is a biological man and he went viral back in early fall for trying to go through the University of Alabama's sorority Rush here is the video that he is known for I did a whole episode about it but just in case you're new here in case you didn't remember this is great hey y'all it's Grant and this is my OOTD for Bama Rush day two today is philanthropy round one so I have a skirt that I got either from Amazon or shin and the shoes are from I don't know I have a diamond anklet and some random jewelry and the panhell shirt and also my makeup is Again by me so wish me luck today and so if you don't remember that story Grant did a whole video series documenting his Rush Journey doing outfits of the day talking about his different meetings with different sororities and in the end he ended up getting cut by the entire panhellenic council did not get into any sororities he gave a whole statement saying like he was trying to be himself he wanted to find community and inclusion he was so sad that he didn't get in dear a man obviously you are not going to get into a sorority I don't care if you put on a skirt it does not work that way actually it kind of does work that way at many universities now because they are letting men in but dude if you want community on a college campus there are so many clubs University of Alabama is huge there are fraternities for you and co-ed fraternities and it's just ridiculous anyway that is the back story but now he is back and before he was just a cute little gay guy in dresses and skirts but now he is fully trans now earlier this year Grant didn't say anything about his sexuality or his gender other than he was basically just gay he was like I said just grant in a cute little skirt doing his dances every day before rush and to many people he just looked like a very feminine gay guy which apparently in 2022 does not exist anymore because you were either CIS and straight or you are transgender or non-binary gender confused there is no middle ground nobody is just a lesbian or gay anymore apparently and the same goes for Grant because he just came out here's his video hey guys it's Grant and I'm transgender I'm a trans woman and my new pronouns are she her well they've always been that but I really don't know how to like word this or how I'm supposed to say these things but I'm so excited it's actually a trans awareness week so it's literally perfect time and I feel like this is my coming up video so while I haven't really ever publicly talked about my sexual orientation or like gender I've always knew them some was something there you know there was something there and I've always struggled with it but since after rush you know I was going through a lot prior and it kind of just Amplified it and I took a little bit of time to like set myself aside and like not like listen I felt kind of outed to be honest from rush because the news and everyone was calling me transgender when like I wasn't even ready to like tell people that and it was just like I just like remember making that video after saying like I'm not trans because I was scared and I didn't want to like come out and especially not on my terms like hello I fell outed basically and I made that video saying that I was non-binary and looking back I could have not even told you what non-binary was at the time always have felt like I'm getting closer and closer and closer to like being a girl okay I just have to pause right here because this is an incredible point and an incredible example he just said that he came out as non-binary but didn't even know what non-binary was this just illustrates everything that is wrong with this generation who desperately wants to fit in and do what is trendy and like discover themselves so it really does not even know the reality of what they are choosing what they are labeling themselves as the long-term ramifications of taking medical steps to affirm their gender they have no idea none and he literally just explained that okay I always have felt like the girls and I hated being separated because I was one of the girls you were one of the girls because you were gay why can't people just be gay anymore I I remember being in PE and I would literally die inside when we were separated by our like sex I was like what is going on why am I over here with the boys like this is so not cool again that doesn't mean that you are trans it means that you get along better with girls and that you're gay if you're in PE and you're a gay feminine guy you don't want to be like rubbing shoulders with all the like high school guys and PE are the worst they are disgusting filthy monsters they are stinky here we go basketball basketball basketball obviously you don't want to be around them and you want to be with the girls that smell nice and are cute does not mean you're trans just trying to explain this for anybody who might be confused out there about their own gender Tick Tock is like not enough time to like explain all this stuff so I also did an exclusive with Insider you can click the link in my bio to go read my story and learn about a little bit of the behind the scenes of Rush like this is going to be a journey and I'm gonna take you along with me and we're just gonna roll make fun of me I'm making fun of myself and we're gonna go with it okay it's just really I'm just overwhelmed with like excitement to really just go into this next chapter I'm just so excited for you guys to meet girl Grant she's ready to be here and she's honest it's giving Elwood it's like you know what I'm saying like I just feel like I'm just so excited and I just want to say I love you all and of a coming out video and more of like a celebrity taking people along as they like unbox some new products does that mean of me to say but this is literally him being like everybody follow me we're all gonna we're gonna be so cute I'm gonna go buy dresses you're gonna see what happens next because he basically does that like I want people to be happy I have empathy for people who are confused and don't fit in and they see these labels and they see people you know getting famous or you know getting clicks and likes I understand that we have this innate need to like fit in and receive that and receive you know the dopamine hits that come with all those likes but it just doesn't even feel genuine and it just makes me sad now like Grant said in the video he sold his coming out piece as an exclusive to Insider which I mean we're gonna get into this later but it feels a bit grifty to me not gonna lie but you know what in this economy I get it times are tough so that's why buying from good ranchers is so important because not only is inflation On The Rise but beef prices are expected to rise

about selling your soul to Insider for some kind of exclusive but what he said about everybody assuming that he was trans was absolutely real I pulled some of these headlines this was from New York Post transgender student grant Sykes rejected from every University of Alabama sorority this was from the pink news it says trans student cruelly rejected by every single University sorority this chapter is closed here's another one transgender student rejected by every University of Alabama sorority and this is how the media painted it even though he never even mentioned his gender as he was going through Russian doing that video series and I even pointed that out in my original video and I said that him not being transgender while going through sorority Rush seemed even more offensive to me because he was just a dude playing dress-up with girls I couldn't even have empathy for a trans guy trying to fit into this weird society and thinking that he needed to be in a sorority again it was just a dude trying to do female sorority rush and that was the weirdest part but anyway now apparently he has realized he's trans he posted that thing on Tick Tock and then he mentioned his exclusive Insider piece here it is it says I was outed as trans while going through the University of Alabama's competitive sorority Rush before I was able to come out to myself that's the key come out to yourself it wasn't like you were closeted and you weren't ready to come out you didn't know until everybody else told you it's the problem with social media and our current Society they're all of these kids that are just quirky and maybe you know dance to the beat of their own drums and that is totally fine you are allowed to be different and not change your gender I can't believe that I'm having to say that but anyway let's just take a look at this article he said Greek life is kind of a big deal at Bama Bama Rush a two week long period in August when sororities decide who they will let in the upcoming year it is a huge event it became even more heightened since 2021 when the hashtag Bama Rush went viral and took over Tick Tock he talks about how people follow it like a reality TV show again if you want more information on it I did a video about him and about Rush In general give some more information I also talk about my sorority experience which is fun anyway then he talks about joining in to sorority rush and he said taking part in bama Rush had unintended consequences at Bama there is a divide between geeds non-greek Affiliated students and those in sororities and fraternities I didn't understand the separation all my friends at the time were in sororities and I wasn't I would go home while they went to date parties and football games as a group and I felt so left out but then my grandma passed away earlier this year and my friends came together to support me and be there for me and it made me realize that I wanted to join a Sisterhood but I wasn't sure if I was able to as a biological male I never openly talked about my orientation or gender identity before rush it was personal for me and I was only 19. I didn't have it all figured out and news flash I still don't this is the most honest paragraph of this entire article he's saying he's only 19 he doesn't have it figured out dude you still don't have it figured out like you said I still don't have it figured out at 19 you're very confused at 21 I still don't know what's going on I'm just flying by the seat of my pants hoping that things work out also obviously you were craving community and Sisterhood after somebody really really important in your life dies that is human nature that does not mean again that you need to change your gender identity I love that you found community and that you wanted to have a Sisterhood but the things don't really connect if that makes sense he goes on and he says according to Alabama panhellenic Association any student who consistently lives and self-identifies as a woman can rush but each chapter decides on its own bylaws I could rush and be a part of the process at UA but UA wouldn't Force any chapter to not discriminate against me so he submitted his packet he paid his application fees and waited talked about posting on Tick Tock here we go but the attention came with a downside as I was going viral on Tick Tock my story was picked up by several media Outlets many of which identified me as transgender despite never having publicly labeled myself that way which is interesting because now he's going through Rush as a woman because at the University of Alabama you have to identify live as a woman in order to go through rush but then he's saying he wasn't actually identifying as a woman anyway then he talks about getting media attention the Fox News article which was the first one to Break apparently daily mail showed up at his house which I don't care who you are without the political aisle you are on that's not appropriate nobody deserves to be doxed especially their family and then he goes on to talk more about his gender identity prior to rush I had been going through a personal journey of looking into my gender identity something I had internally struggled with for years I had always wanted to be just like the other girls but I told myself that coming from a small town like home in Alabama it was enough to be openly Femme and gay now his gender identity was being discussed by International media and millions of people on social media that was hurtful and made me feel exposed I hadn't been able to tell my story when I was ready in the way that I wanted to make this worse the University of Alabama panhellenic Association rules basically forbid us from speaking to any Media or revealing anything that goes on during rush over social media we weren't allowed to post anything other than outfit of the day so what's in my Rush Bag videos I remember I vlogged the first day and posted it to tick tock and the AP a told me to take it down but yeah I reposted it since then then he talks about being pressured to expose his gender identity here we go now we go to the end and he said since going viral I've gotten thousands of messages from other lgbtqia plus teens telling me that they have always wanted to be in a sorority fraternity but were too scared and now they have the courage to rush it really makes me feel hope for the outdated system I wanted to join a sorority so I could feel like I belonged unfortunately we all know that I didn't find a Sisterhood in a sorority but I did find one online that's nice very happy for Grant going viral on social media gave me the confidence to be myself and Outlook back I finally faced those feelings I pushed down on the football field in first grade I have learned so many lessons through this whole experience and I wouldn't ever go back lgbtq icons like Dylan Mulvaney sharing their Journey online gave me more confidence to be myself and share mine the biggest lesson I've learned is to be thankful for what I have and what I don't have and I want to thank everybody who supported me and I'm so excited to start this next chapter together now it is important that he talks about Dylan Mulvaney at the end here Dylan because Grant is now also going to be documenting his his transition online and not just documenting it online and on Tick Tock he is doing the days of girlhood that is what got Dylan Mulvaney Super Famous it is what Dylan Mulvaney is known for he is literally doing the exact days of girlhood here's the first video hey guys it's Grant it's day one of being openly a girl and I'm gonna go get my nails done I've got my nails done before and This Time It's Different because like I feel like growing up I always wanted my nails done and I felt like I would never be able to get my nails done and like I feel like it's such a staple of like femininity to get your nails done obviously whatever but that's a stereotype but I want to live that and so I'm gonna go get my Nelson and I'm not have them in literally forever so let's go I'm glad that he openly admits that it is a stereotype it's the same thing with Dylan everything that they talk about like Dylan's first video he was like oh my God I couldn't decide where to eat and then I ordered a bunch of things and I put them all in my shopping cart and then I didn't check out any of it and then I ordered pizza and I sat in my bed and I cried and I watched a rom-com I'm such a girl that's not being a woman that's like mocking women and feeding into stereotypes male stereotypes about women you don't have to have your nails done to be a woman if I wasn't doing the show and I was not on camera all the time I would not have my nails done it's expensive and it takes hours out of my week not all women want this okay we're moving on Okay so yesterday I went got my nails done I got like a lavender such a pretty color for a pretty girl anyways um yeah I've got the Almond like shape because I just feel like that's more practical I feel like eventually I will move into a girly like Khloe Kardashian where I have like the stilettos and coffins and stuff don't do it but not right now because the sister has to type and it's hard typing on a computer and live with like last night I was like you know my Nails Hurt probably because I won't I literally am obsessive about stuff I like I will literally be fidgeting all day long with my nails now anyways I got this pretty color and yes it makes me feel like a little bit curly and what do we think what is that oh my God period slay love anyways love you oh yeah I had a really good time in there it was really funny and I think it's always funny when I go get my nails done I've not gotten them done in like over a year but uh when I sit down and like they figure out that I want my nails done they just like joke and they're just like funny you know what I'm saying like I can tell that they're funny I guess anyways I hope you're having a good day okay here's the thing I'm like really missing Dylan right now I'm just gonna say it when I watch Dylan's videos I want him to be happy I obviously have my critiques and my concerns like as a woman and as somebody who does not feed it and affirm all of this stuff but he feels more genuine he makes me happy and like I laugh at some of those videos like I loved Dylan as a tick tocker before he started all the transitioning stuff this makes me angry why are you doing this after ever what is that what no stop it I don't even care about your gender you're annoying is that mean I'm so sorry I'm just like Fed Up Now this video isn't done also no matter what you look like and if you think that you're not allowed to get your nails done literally I promise you you can get your nails done there's no rolls to nails or like any of this like at all um and so I figured like you know since I'm openly trans now and like I'm starting this whole long process and whatever I was like nails are a cute little celebration so I just wanted to say that because I feel like some people need to hear it like me as a kid scared that I was never gonna have nails or that I wasn't allowed to have nails God it's just so aggressive the whole tribalization of this too like I guess I'm trans now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna start this long journey if you're actually going to go through with all of this do the medical transition that is not something that you can take back we know now that puberty blockers they aren't reversible going on hormones that's not reversible you can't just stop and go back to normal you are permanently changing your body in the direction of your life and this whole like oh it's just so fun I'll just I'll just decide right now it's so silly I'm just gonna get nails I'm gonna be a little girl and it's gonna be great I'm just the cell phone at least have some respect for the process you are making a huge life change this is not just something that you throw away know the severity of what you are doing and if you choose to do that as an adult because you are an adult that is totally fine but posting it on social media as if it is just this quick easy thing that you can take take back and just decide on a whim that's harmful especially for young people this one is also pretty similar to Dylan's style he's doing like questions about being a woman which Dylan has done some videos like that 86 of being a girl and I wrote down questions that I have for myself right now and my Diaries so do I want big boobs and are they going to be hard um what kind of bra do I need because this one I could not tell you where I got it from I think someone left it in my apartment and yeah I don't even know anything about it it doesn't have a name on it and I think it's a sports bra anyways um do I respond to hey comments how do I flirt with boys what do I even said am I do I just be like oh you look really hot today Jacob um and do I tell them that I'm trans um and what do I say like anything will I ever be loved and why do I have crippling anxiety what even is anxiety am I dying am I too tall to be a girl my biggest fear is being rejected do I need to start a juice cleanse like every other girl is my forehead too big um well no it's not my forehead to you just watching Rich one day again this all feels a bit contrived it feels like I'm going to be ADHD and talk like girls talk and go all over the place and use like flowery language and like oh maybe we'll do a juice cleanse again it just feels like a female stereotype the thing that did make me sad in this though was why do I have so much anxiety am I gonna die whatever maybe we should address that first maybe that's the root problem you talked about it in your exclusive Insider article you've talked about it in other videos about how you don't fit in and you want Community you want Sisterhood you just lost one of the most important people in your life last year and you've been grieving obviously you are going to be emotionally going through something grief is awful it completely changes you it completely changes your perspective on life anxiety is understandable I have anxiety I deal with it all the time that should be the root problem that you are working through not just changing your gender and hoping that that fixes things now most of the comments on all of Grant's videos are pretty sugary sweet affirming and they're all like kind of sadly boring like I went through them trying to find some funny ones even some funny affirming ones there weren't many it was just all like oh my God you're so inspiring this is so amazing whatever but this one did stand out this person said honey you don't have to upfront tell any man you are trans unless you feel safe with them you are so loved no you should tell guys especially when you get further along in your transition like I think many times you can tell if somebody is trans or not but also don't fake it that on principle that is just wrong I don't think you're going to have that problem right now because you still look very much like a guy on principle yes you should be transparent you should have integrity when you are considering going out with somebody or dating somebody bringing somebody else into your life this video oh my God this killed me this was posted by Libs of tick tock Grant went out and bought tampons just like Dylan I mean literally copying Dylan to a t watch this video day 12 of being a girl and we're gonna go buy tampons well let's go where is that what the I don't know which one should I get at the Tampax Pearl um I think these are like little dots to see how much you flow is what somebody said online I don't know let's do an unboxing um it literally has instructions okay this is a tampon this thing does not go up inside you like where does that go oh my God what the hell okay so it says you pushed the plunger up and yeah kidding that just hangs out inside you how does it how do you get it out is that what this thing's for oh oh it comes open oh oh do you like oh where does the string go I bought tampons because I've never bought them before if you need one love you that made me incredibly uncomfortable and I am an actual woman that was kind of fun to see a man look at tampons and have to work through that anyway but here's the thing this is day 12 of Grant's Journey let's look at this look at the comparison gate 12 of being a girl and I just picked up some tampons y'all are probably thinking Dylan where are you gonna put those they're not for me but this last weekend I was in the restroom and the girl in the stall next to me was like hey do you have a tampon and I froze I was like sorry no but in that moment I decided you know what I'm always gonna have one on hand for anyone who needs it you come over to my house and we're having a glass of wine I got a tampon for you if we're in the club together and then we go to the bathroom I got a tampon for you women supporting women love you he's even doing the love yeah at the end just like Dylan does again this makes me miss Dylan because Dylan's whole thing was a little more authentic like I want to have it to give to girls grants was like let me just unbox this [\u00a0__\u00a0] let me love you take this apart where do I stick it then it was after this video that Dylan got offered a Tampax sponsorship still so ridiculous God this world is so stupid I just can't get over this though because not only is he just following like the days of girlhood structure he's following some of the days to a t somebody replied to the lips of tick tock video on Twitter and said are we sure this video isn't a troll of Dylan like who thinks of doing a full copycat video even to get likes I everybody on tick tock tick tock's whole thing is like copying and pasting and hoping that you go viral like Dylan was a moderately well-known tick tocker he was a Broadway actor he was living in a tiny La apartment back in June but after making the days of girlhood videos when they first blew up like that tampon video has millions and millions of views there's like five million likes so the views are even higher he went viral he has met Biden he rubs shoulders with the Kardashians on like a monthly basis he's moved into a much bigger La house he's up for huge acting gigs it worked for him so I wouldn't be surprised if Grant hoped that it would work for him too I mean he literally sold his coming out story two Insider as an exclusive and that is why I think it is so important to talk about social contagion surrounding transgenderism and The non-binary Craze it is the influence throughout a population based on interactions and it kind of defines what is cool what is trendy all of that it pays to tap into gender confusion right now it is cool to be confused it is cool to be lgbtq that is why we see so many pre-teens teens and young adults posting about their gender dysphoria and Euphoria online because it gets likes and it gets people applauding them and affirming them and saying you are so brave again it's a dopamine hit it's the mixture between getting likes online and having just a bunch of people say you are so cool this is so fun this is so trendy a few years ago the example of this was anxiety and depression it was cool to be anxious people started throwing the word depressed around like it was nothing oh this made me so depressed oh I'm so anxious about this that's still a thing but it's grown into now I'm trans now I'm non-binary I'm all for working to normalize taboo subjects especially mental health things for people who truly suffer and don't want to live in silence and suffer quietly but the severity is much greater when it comes to transgenderism and the gender confusion craze because the mainstream media is backing this narrative so when these kids come out they have all of these weird creepy adults that are saying this is so amazing and on top of that these kids are then moving through their lives taking medical action to affirm this new identity like this is not just putting on a ton of eyeliner and saying that you're goth back in the 90s this is dropping off your dick and growing boobs you can't wipe that away with makeup remover okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "wcUmOADHnfQ": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper i hope everybody had a fantastic weekend i certainly did the internet per usual did not but you know i actually did not spend a ton of time online this weekend which was delightful but for the few moments i did there was one story that really caught my attention the new york times did something idiotic but when are they not but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode so the new york times decided that it was a great idea to tweet this cannibalism has a time and a place some recent books films and shows suggest that the time is now can you stomach it and then they put this new york times article uh it is called a taste for cannibalism a spate of recent stomach churning books tv shows and films suggest we've never looked so delicious to one another our society according to the new york times is so depraved is so lit on fire inside of a dumpster that now is the time for us to accept cannibalism now to you know give the new york times not credit but to acknowledge the broader you know sense of the story this is absolutely click bait in a way they are trying to get people talking about it online they are wanting people to look at the article going oh my god are they saying we need to eat each other when in reality yes it is weird that they are trying to normalize cannibalism they are talking about it in a cultural sense they are talking about it in regards to you know books tv shows movies and they are saying you know like we are seeing this insurgence of cannibalist literature all of that and they're commenting on it first of all why is there an insurgence of cannibalist themed art i don't know that should be a topic of discussion but also why new york times how did we leap from you're going to eat bugs to you're going to eat another like guys i just want to sit at home and eat my good ranchers meat i love good ranchers because they are not bugs they are not human meat they are true american grown meat they have beef they have chicken they have seafood it is all american grown and harvested and they are fantastic patriots and once you subscribe your price never changes so you don't have to worry about all the prices that

so go to goodranchers.com cooper to get 30 off of your order plus free shipping you guys will not regret this my next good ranchers box comes in tomorrow or wednesday i think i am so excited i'll make sure to post some photos you guys tag me in anything that you make with your good ranchers meet i will re-share it you're gonna love it because we are apparently entering a cannibalist era so we need to revolt and push back as much as possible now i want to give you some quotes from the article you can go read it if you would like it is behind a paywall so in case you don't want to pay for the new york times i have a couple of quotes here for you the beginning of it says turns out cannibalism has a time and a place in the pages of some recent stomach churning books and on television in the film screens miss summers and others suggest that that time is now now according to this woman miss summers cannibalism is always symbolic and she says here that eating human flesh can be seen as a way of holding on to a relationship that ended this is an author again concerning yes i get that it is in your novel but the fact that you believe that cannibalism is a way of maybe getting over your ex or not getting over your ex i don't really know if i want to live in a society with you miss summers just saying they move on and she says that the recent spate of cannibalistic plots could also be commentaries on capitalism she says cannibalism is about consumption and it's about burning up from the inside in order to exist burnout is essentially over consuming yourself your own energy your own will to survive your sleep schedule your eating schedule your body now it's interesting because i was just talking with michael knowles about this we were talking about this article and it was interesting because he said he could actually see how cannibalism could be tied to a very extreme form of capitalism in a way and it's interesting that somebody on the left hit on that in a way actually talking about over consumption burning yourself out that kind of thing that you know what happens in capitalism when you don't have a fulfilling life outside of you know just making money they touch on it and then they immediately run away and go back to their left-wing ideas they don't actually talk about what would be meaningful in order to fix that situation they go oh maybe this is a problem you know over consumption and burnout so instead let's just eat each other not you know let's have a fulfilling life outside of it let's have a family let's have meaningful relationships have a relationship with you know god or something like that no let's just eat each other so it's interesting because he pointed that out that was not something that i had really grasped from that another person in the article said that her theory was that it might be an antidote to the actual horror of what's happening to the planet she at times could not even stomach her own work describing the process of writing about cannibalism as a bit disturbing yeah no ma'am it's freaky also an antidote to the actual horror of what's happening to the planet i swear these people that truly believe that like doomsday is 21 years seven years i don't know what the latest prediction is and the world will end in 2012. i think we just hit the 21 years that al gore predicted where he said we're going to be up in flames no we're not al like i care about the environment i care about this planet but if you keep being alarmist if you keep saying oh it's seven years and then we hit that point you're you're destructing your own argument i'm sorry if you are so wound up about this planet that you are equating our climate to cannibalism you have some problem that you need to go fix touch grass if you care so much about the environment please stop writing about cannibalism obviously uh internet had thoughts the liberty lockdown podcast posted these screenshots originally and somebody said i'm pretty sure that there's a direct link between communism and cannibalism you know because they run out of food they might have pulled a muscle trying to reach with that capitalism is like cannibalism stretch which actually was my first thought before i did talk to michael and then i think he made a really interesting point because on the surface level yes under communism under a new world order under a great reset we're just gonna be you know shills for the government little broke property-less hungry drones having to eat each other please don't i don't want to do that somebody else said god help me if dark meat tastes the best i do wonder you know in this incredibly woke anti-racist world what would the racial implications be of a cannibalist society right now food for thought somebody said oh god it started with nibbling on toes yeah you freaks somebody said real cannibalism has never been tried there apparently is real cannibalism i was gonna show this video later but this comment is actually perfect for it there was a viral video from cnn i know i know a reporter went to talk with a cannibalist culture and society just look at this video it's absolutely hysterical and kind of freaky so that's human ash on his face maybe i'll take this off right now and then just thank you okay thank you this poor man why are people on that side of the river so afraid of the agory okay then his translator just leaves we have to stop for a moment this is you know 45 seconds in he's sitting here he's going why are the people so afraid because this tribe is going to eat them the man is going i will eat your face if you stop eating it his translator just gets up and leaves he's like never mind dude i'm out you deal with it yourself real cannibalism has never been tried no it is being tried right here and that's terrifying i'm not trying to you know stamp on any you know cultures i'm not trying to say that an indigenous world is not you know whatever but i'm sorry in america in 2022 that that is not what we want that reporter is all of us listening to this story i believe somebody else said they got whole restaurants where they inject meat with your favorite celebrities dna and then they promote cannibalism lol and y'all still think the industry is normal okay what restaurants i tried to look that up nobody was saying anything in the comments what restaurants how do i prevent my dna from ever getting injected into any of that i wonder if that's what happens when you do like 23andme and you send in your dna to those things and they're like oh we'll just sell them to a michelin star underground restaurant where people can go and eat your dna that just solidified that i'm never doing one of those tests ever here we go here's the racist stuff is it more racist to eat white people or black people do different ethnicities taste different is cannibalism indigenous science and unfairly demonized by white supremacy patriarchy systems of oppression we need answers to these super relevant questions that's sort of what the article was touching on not really but they were trying to pose these big questions about what cannibalism would look like in a broader culture but that is what i was just saying about the indigenous whatever if a tribe wants to do it far away from me okay but don't come in here and say that i'm oppressing them by acknowledging that i don't want to live in that world that that's just common sense at this point stephen king says i'm thinking of a cannibalism rom-com called when harry ate sally yes yes yes stephen please don't your works already make my stomach churn i don't need anything else i get that this is a joke but please don't somebody else said this tweet is a great way to suss out who actually reads articles before they respond and who just gives an instant knee-jerk reactions the way twitter and brands want them to for engagement see yes and she does make a good point because they want the clicks they want people fired up about it and while yes the article is more substantive than just the tweet and the headline but i'm sorry they are still saying that our culture is ripe and ready for cannibalism just injecting it into culture and film and movies and that kind of thing the next step is oh maybe let's try it let's normalize it so a pardon me but i do think people are you know kind of valid in their worry and their minor outrage on twitter in the comments section because it's weird the new york times needs to calm down maybe the new york times is just talking about it just talking about it in books and tv and films but like i showed you in that video it is actually out there cannibalism is a real thing do you guys remember army hammer the actor from called me by your name who was accused of cannibalism now i don't know if that is true i think maybe it was folklore i don't really know what happened with that i think he's in rehab for something else now there was a whole situation where people have apparently spotted him selling timeshares in florida or something and they think that that's part of his rehab program that he has to have a normal job i don't know what is going on with him but he was accused of cannibalism and so yes while this article has a little click bait title and all of that they are normalizing the idea it's like the whole like just watch nicole kidman eat bugs it's just a hobby of hers no they're they're normalizing it another great example of this literally happened this month july of 2022 a swedish company won an award at the cons lions festival of creativity for creating vegan meat that tasted like human meat what the hell is wrong with you people they won an award for their vegan human burger it's weird it's made out of soya mushrooms and wheat protein with plant-based fats the head of innovation for this company is called anakin but he goes by the duck that's just weird and he mentioned a secret spice mix that helps it taste like human meat how do they know that it tastes like human meat how do they know that this spice mix actually tastes like my arm i'm sorry if this article makes me incredibly uncomfortable because somebody out there has tasted human meat and has decided to make vegan burgers out of it i just want to end on a brighter note with an alex jones compilation because in this sense he is very right if we do have to engage in cannibalism at some point if you come for my future kids whatever i will eat you but i will actually just eat journalists first he gets it right okay [Music] i will eat my children aren't going hungry i'll do it i'll drink your blood and i'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors you think i like sizing up on a haul in my back chain chop his ass up size it up i'm gonna haul him up that chain chop chop chop chop i will eat your leftist ass like corn on the cob i'm ready obviously i'm not trying to do that but i like the sentiment you know it's kind of like the around and find out of cannibalism hey hey i can't believe you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "zPL3mrkTgN8": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper guys we are back with more Kanye because he broke the internet yet again this is probably like the fifth time this week and he is not slowing down anytime soon but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection alright so randomly yesterday Tucker Carlson dropped this insane very not normal tweet and I just knew that I was in for a wild ride he said tonight at Kanye West yay 8pm Eastern Time Fox News channel in the classic Kanye font typeface look and everything like Tucker is fully bought in and I'm here for it leftists were in Tucker's comment section trying to play it off like this was not going to be the biggest interview of the freaking year it's Kanye Kanye West Susan says you deserve each other okay somebody else said I have way more important things to do like changing a roll of toilet paper but thanks champ great another person said thanks for the warning I'd rather watch paint dry somebody else said real pick me Vibes like okay you people are just boring and sad and you missed out because this is what happened during the interview like I genuine it was wild and I guarantee your toilet paper was not as interesting first before they got into the interview he had Tucker try on his boots and taste the new donda drink which I didn't even know was a thing that's delicious it's great right yes you can try this one as well I'll try anything in your hand for sure what does that taste like it tastes like activated charcoal honey Sesame I can taste all of it some people say peanut butter and jelly yes that's what I was curious one too please and that's Connie filming he's so soft smoker hibiscus and then coffee just lit as well chances I'll like this 100 yeah if you ever had like bunny milk or yeah that's actually incredible yeah I don't taste the coffee though so we literally put coffee through a distiller um so it's like a clear imagine the insanity of working at easy in for Kanye like the things like distilling coffee making crazy outfits like it's got the information thank you uh yeah These are 3D printed um right now we're exploring now we're showing him the boots 3D printing facility like a farm can I ask a stupid question yeah are they are they assembled is the soul attached or are they printed it's all one solid piece that's printed that's incredible yeah that that takes like so it emerges hours 30 hours right now I love seeing like Giga Chad preppy Tucker Carlson getting immersed in donda oh my God you might want to pair those remain huh yes I wear I mean I wear boots hunting I wear them yesterday and they're kind of like this but uh when you print it I just love Tucker's face because he's just he's like his eyes are being opened to an entirely New World outside of Maine outside of the you know Fox News Studio he's in the freaking Yeezy headquarters drinking activated charcoal and taking his little loafers off and putting on donda boots it's just wild to me somebody said another shiny example of yay being the new face of white supremacy in America I have no words about that it's like can you please look at the color of his skin it just does not even work that way somebody said when you have no friends left so you run to Tucker Carlson you've reached the bottom of the barrel now I think Connie is making a lot more friends these days because he's actually speaking truth so I think he got it backwards somebody else said okay and now you canceled for real well all right moving on he's not gonna miss you I guarantee it but now we can actually dive into the actual interview that was aired on Fox news that video was just posted on Kanye's Instagram but he first defended wearing the White lives matter T-shirt with Candace at Paris fashion week and continued to slam BLM this one's shorter but it's just it's concise so the answer to why I wrote White lives matter on a shirt is because they do obvious thing and by the way he is fully on the Candace train now before the interview went up with Tucker he actually reposted the trailer for Candace's new BLM documentary which is called the greatest lie ever sold he posted that on his Instagram to literally 18 million followers which is just insane I mean the reach he has is wild this is why I think this is so important that documentary the greatest lie ever sold comes out on October 12th on daily wire it is going to be huge I mean it is basically blm's funeral I would just kill to have Kanye randomly show up who knows maybe he will she even invited Jaden Smith because you know his whole thing about leaving Connie's fashion show because he was so offended so Candace actually sent out an invite to Jaden so we'll see but anyway back to the interview he also spoke out about his pro-life values this is probably my favorite part of the entire interview it's just so strong here we go the lanyard's still on from it and there's a photograph on it what is that it's a photograph of a baby's ultrasound why is that and that you designed that yes why what does that mean it just represents life from pro-life boy so you wear it on a badge what what kind of response do you get and good amen I agree I don't care about people's responses I care about the fact that there's more black babies being aborted them born in New York City at this point that 50 of Black Death in America is abortion so I really don't care about people's responses I perform for audience of one and that's God I'm sorry I'm starting to see why they want to make you be quiet I mean that is just huge for the pro-life movement before I get into full commentary we have two more Clips so I'm just going to show you those back to back let's let's just or if someone thinks is attractive to each his own it's actually clinically unhealthy it's body positivity and for people to owe to promote that um it's a it's demonic it was wild that I didn't know how close my own wife was to the clintons I didn't know you know I I didn't realize it at the time that you were married to her and well I was married to her how close was she to the clintons I mean cell phone away like or hey tell yay to say this away or hey go out and use your platform to push uh the vaccination I'm sorry what like that clip cuts off real quick but the clintons calling Kanye to push vaccination I mean we shouldn't even be surprised by that we literally just talked about how Pfizer made a comic book to try to Gaslight people into getting boosted or whatever so that shouldn't even be a surprise but it's still wild somebody said it's Defcon 1 in newsrooms everywhere after Kane's interview with Tucker last night yet literally I would say that Kanye needs to watch out because he now has like an Epstein style target on his back but I think he already knows the dangers of speaking about his values and the truth because he said this my so-called friends slash handlers around me told me like if I said that I like Trump that my career will be over that my life would be over uh they said stuff like people get killed for wearing a hat like that they threaten my life they put my life they basically said that I would be killed which a lot of people say that's ridiculous political violence isn't real these days but we've literally had multiple cases in the last month where people have been assaulted and actually killed for political differences like that is the kind of division that we are seeing in this country right now and he is absolutely 100 spot on and I don't think I can really concisely put into words what this interview means but I mean it is huge for our culture I mean he is one of the most influential significant artists and celebrities of this generation like hands down he moves culture with every brand move and release and new clothing item and song and album in concert and he is unafraid and literally Unleashed right now and so many people only see the side of Kanye that has been portrayed by the Kardashians or the side of Kanye that's you know posting crazy things on Instagram and all capital letters but those clips that we just watched does that man look insane no that is obviously a man that has been beaten down literally hauled through the mud and has still come out stronger and more articulate and more secure in his beliefs somebody commented and said man when he's good he's good yes absolutely agree another person said yay took Ayahuasca and saw the truth something like that but I mean I don't believe that this is some newfangled like he's been red pill that he came around I do believe that he has always had these values he's always been fighting under the radar but he has been you know held down by handlers or you know his wife whatever and obviously this is incredibly threatening to The Establishment I mean they're not even trying to hide it like look at this article from MSNBC that was published literally hours mere hours after the interview was aired they say the artist formerly known as Kanye West seems to be seeking out a legacy as a racist hate Monger let him have it and then they put this image that has this bright red filter on it to make him look like some kind of satanic devil creature and then the title is no one should weep for yay nobody is weeping people aren't sitting around going oh I'm so sad he's no people are empowered whether they are angry or they are super excited about this he is creating rousing change in his audience nobody is sitting around crying over Kanye right now so MSNBC per usual is very out of touch but their comments it was just a major white pill they got ratioed to high heaven somebody said I'm sure he's quite concerned with what dudes like Rachel Maddow think about him another person said a media giant telling a black man how to think is the wokest move ever yes but as we know this is also very typical I mean minorities in marginalized communities are tokens for them and they're only useful when they fall into line whenever they break from the mainstream narrative it always reminds me of that Toy Story meme of the kid going I don't want to play with you anymore and tossing the toy like that is basically what happens when anybody like Kanye or any marginalized person steps out and says I actually don't agree with the leftist agenda the Kanye has broken free he is waking people up by talking to Tucker and supporting Candace he is crossing cultural and political lines and others have been too scared to do before like this is needed more than ever and I can't imagine the change that it's gonna make like this is huge hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "ynIEEpSva7Q": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper i found this video last night and it was just so wild that i had to figure out how to do an episode about it and i really don't have a way to explain this or set this up because the story itself is just an absolute mind twister uh so i'm just going to show it to you but before we get into it make sure you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already bring

if you have not already but for now let's look at this absolutely ridiculous video here we go mentioning those power lines dangerous situation as he is uh literally um dangling and trying to switch over to the other side using several power lines uh as his uh base to just basically use some more you know as a base to hold on but the weight okay i watch this and the only thing i can think of first i thought of a sloth and then my mind was like no bro what are you thinking it's tarzan like this man the power of phil collins is running through his veins i need my editors can you put a clip of that phil collins song from tarzan it's like son of man son of man look too i need that playing as that guy is pulling [Music] free this is a very unique way to run from the cops i saw comments where people are going like hey this is so innovative just like let them go like this is just too entertaining to watch the man had to get up onto those power lines somehow and was running from the police for some reason so obviously we need to talk about that um he's in dc and apparently he broke into a woman's house yesterday took off his clothes apparently fired some gunshots and then got up on the roof and started running not running pulling himself on the power lines he was then sitting among the branches and when the police weren't able to get them down they inflated a giant balloon thing for him to fall and jump on and apparently now he is in custody the whole thing is just wild there's a picture of the big float thing that they put under the trees this is now at night and they're waiting for him somebody commented and said wow these crossfit folks keep taking crazy to a new level uh another person said that's not a good way to conduct yourself oh that's good nearby birds watching like oh god i love the internet somebody else said everything i was told about power lines is a lie yes okay i as a child was so afraid to even go near one of the like the power line poles because i thought that i was gonna get electrocuted i don't know maybe he's not on a power line but he's on a phone line but i thought that if i even got too close like radioactivity 5g power electrocution death basically am i the only one who watches this and is more annoyed at the mass amounts of wire hanging in the air our electric grid is archaic yeah you can say that again which actually reminds me this is not in california this happened in dc but have you guys been watching what is happening in california they are now at a i believe it is called a level three emergency alert it happened yesterday over the past week newsom and the energy grid operator have been warning there's a heat wave and the energy grid just can't keep up so they've been going oh i if you don't have to i wouldn't charge your electric car you know which is absolutely moronic because pete buddha judge and newsom and every single elite democrat has been preaching at people to go buy electric cars like oh sorry the gas prices are too high just go buy a tesla i don't know and now you can't even charge your damn cars but anyway i digress this is what happened yesterday this tweet came out it said breaking california's grid operator has just issued a level three emergency energy alert the highest category california iso says that this means that they are unable to meet energy demand and rolling blackouts are either imminent or in progress he then replied and said california iso says they are not yet calling for rolling blackouts this was yesterday i was watching these tweets in real time that was posted around 2 p.m literally less than an hour later he replies again and says new rolling blackouts have begun in palo alto and alameda like california is the dumpster fire because hell is no longer a place only accessible after death this is going on the heat wave is happening i'm guessing the state is all up in flames and it's fire season and also there was so much pee and poop in the water outside of san francisco that it is going to cost them 14 billion to get rid of the harmful toxic algae that has begun to grow in the water so things are not looking good if you have not moved out of california yet now might be a good time the good old gavin newsom tweeted out and said extreme temperatures across the west are causing extreme stress on california's energy grid save power now to help avoid outages turn your thermostat up to 78 or higher and avoid use of major appliances that was right before the energy grid operator said no things are shutting down right now other people were tweeting out that they got screenshots emergency alerts saying conserve energy now to protect public health and safety extreme heat is straining the state energy grid so everybody got those on their phone but honestly the replies were a white pill uh somebody responded and said no offense bill but no one gives a [\u00a0__\u00a0] they get what they get another guy said not a single californian will reconsider how they vote not one another person said why did ron death sanus do this to california because obviously they will find some way to blame red states for this and you know what in regards to that reply where you said not a single california will reconsider how they vote i don't know if you guys know this but california has the most republican voters in the country but because of how densely populated san francisco la san diego all of those cities are there will never be a red wave they are so blue they are the brightest blue possible but there are so many good people there that are voting to try to make a change that are trying to save the state that are sticking it out and i don't think it's ever going to happen it really is not my mom was born in l.a her businesses are still in california all my brothers are born in california i lived there for 10 years we love california but at this point all of us are like you know what you might as well break off from the country and fall into the ocean because there really is no saving it and i don't just mean because of the values that i disagree with and the types of people but environmentally like physically the state is unwell and i'm guessing that if that man that criminal was in california he'd probably be able to walk on any power line he wants because none of them are working i should not have said that because crime is rampant in california so now we're going to have a bunch of homeless robbers running up on the power lines so california you've got a new problem on your hands guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "2XcDtKDrnNA": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper i haven't talked about netflix in a bit entertainment is a focal you know point in the culture war i personally believe that hollywood and entertainment film and tv really dictates a lot of our cultural attitudes because we spend hours and hours on end especially young people taking in that content and whether we you know are conscious of it or not we are taking in their messages absorbing their themes learning subconsciously from the things that these tv shows and films are promoting netflix is at the forefront of all of this but they might not be for much longer but before we get into it make sure that you like this video and if you are not a subscriber of the comment section yet i hope that today we earn that subscription ring that notification bell so that you never miss a video we're doing tons of fun new content and i don't want you to miss any of it i'm so happy that all of you guys are here i say this a lot but i just can't believe how fast this show has grown i love getting to know all of you we hang out all the time on those live streams really is a great community and i'm very grateful that you are all part of it and that we can sit around and discuss these insane people that we are living amongst every single day so netflix is realizing as well that the world is absolutely insane which is why a couple of weeks ago they updated their culture memo and their employee handbook basically saying to their employees that they would be doing content that might be more political or that wouldn't you know please some of them and if you want to work in netflix you have to be okay with that and if you're not okay with that if you're going to be triggered you know by a ricky gervais special by dave chappelle this would probably not be the place to work which i think is a great way to approach it if you are a mainstream media company you should be able to do a political content both sides of political aisle and your employees need to get over it and deal with it but this move was not totally genuine on netflix's part because they lost i think it was 250 000 subscribers in their first quarter second quarter they lost another couple hundred thousand and they are expected to lose literally millions over the course of the next year so they are scrambling uh daily wire posted this last night they said netflix lays off hundreds more amid major subscription losses this article basically you know explains the numbers that they are seeing the cycle of layoffs netflix is really just not doing well tis but a scratch and it sucks because netflix used to be a quality platform and then they went woke and fed into cancer culture and a political agenda but you know what company will never do that and will never let you down nimi skin care because they are actively against wokeness and cancer culture and they are the only conservative skincare brand i have been using nimi products since january i think and they have completely changed my skin i have always had very sensitive skin and so specific products really mess with me i have never had a problem with nimmy i use their daily glow up routine it is absolutely incredible i have to wear makeup every single day for this job and so my skin has really been through the wringer and nimmy has been there to make sure that i am refreshed and hydrated and i want that for you all too especially you boys because i know you talk down about skin care you don't want to use it but it would not kill you to just try a hydrating cream and so you can go to nimmyskincare.com and use promo code cooper at checkout to get 15 off i promise you you will not regret it i am literally going home today and going online to order some for my mom because she's been wanting to try it since i literally rave about it every day go check them out they are a fantastic company and their quality will never be demolished by wokeness the truth is netflix is honestly just trying to backpedal because they're going broke because they went woke they fed into cancel culture they fed into this whole political agenda they're losing subscriptions they're losing a lot of quality content but they are losing more subscriptions in the process and they are losing a lot of quality og content like i think since maybe 2018 their content has just like absolutely tanked they have canceled a bunch of netflix originals and quality tv shows that are now off the air they aren't able to afford anymore and it shows because at this point hbo max's catalog really dominates the entire streaming you know pyramid truly they are flailing and people on twitter are aware of that uh if you just look up netflix subscription or netflix content this is what comes up somebody said at this point my subscription to netflix has become more of a matter of religious tradition rather than genuine faith i don't think i've logged onto number one i don't have a netflix subscription as most people don't i log on to somebody else's but i go on and i don't see anything that's interesting like i don't see anything new other than reality tv somebody said hey things could be worse you could be the person paying for the netflix subscription yeah that's tough just cancelled my netflix subscription because they announced they're adding advertising and that wouldn't be so bad if they actually had better content and more of it they produced so much cheap rubbish with bad acting now it's just not worth to spend so that's the other thing because they are losing so many subscribers they are realizing that they need to have kind of like a hulu option where it's a much lower spend but then they can use advertisers to you know make up the money that they're losing hoping to get more people but people don't want that apparently they don't want to pay less and get advertisements they genuinely just want the good netflix content back so i really don't know if that's going to be successful and speaking of their terrible content they just announced their summer lineup these are gonna be the things that are premiering in july just read these this person said full 90 of these sound like rejected 30 rock gags if you guys know the show 30 rock it is about a show kind of like snl it's in like 30 rockefeller which is where snl shoots it's a fantastic show it's with tina fey one of my new year's resolutions is to say yes yes to love yes to life yes to staying in more but just get your mind in that world and then listen to these stranger things four volume two boo resident evil blown away season three virgin river season four dream home makeover season three farzar control z season three king of stonks king of stonks okay here's this is my favorite how to build a sex room what the longest night those kind of go together apparently syntonia season three that also kind of goes with those last two remarriage and desires that also fits in the same world what the hell is this crap i have watched virgin river that is you know a very cheesy basically hallmark show not really that quality apparently stranger things is good i don't know i don't watch that show i don't really care i have no idea what any of this other stuff is somebody said netflix these days when they're looking for ideas this person's going through the trash yeah accurate somebody else said i heard you guys are going to be forcing me to watch advertisements on my paid subscription fyi if you start making me watch ads i'm going to cancel my subscription entirely yeah to watch boo i'm not going to watch advertisements so that i can see boo or remarriage and desires i'll just go log on to youtube and watch old days of our lives reruns if that's the content you're gonna be doing the one that really stood out to me on this list because it seemed so bizarre and just had a terrible yet very descriptive title was how to build a sex room how what really goes what really goes into that is it literally just i don't really want to know the only thing that i really know is the people on twitter have described this woman who was leading the show as the mary poppins of bdsm design i'm very popular so let's just dive into that okay my name is melanie rose for over 15 years i've been designing high-end so when a client asked me if i'd ever designed a sex room i thought why not why wouldn't i go and design a sex room when people hear the word sex rooms they concentrate on the word sex and that connotates dirty disgusting and they are places where couples can explore their deepest fantasies i would have never thought that being tied in rope would make me feel sexy oh that's brilliant it's curiosity that is being unlocked are you kidding me you were our angel for our marriage thank you so much mr mary poppins they say you never know what goes on behind closed doors ooh but i do oh my god this is like oh and they used the sex in the city font oh that's weird okay wait what's she saying had a beautiful flower well yeah i mean i i suppose that's right i think anything from that would be deviating from the norm i am uncomfortable to say the least you know netflix has parental controls they have that option where you can have kids stuff but it's not really that effective it's not really you know all-encompassing i would say do you know how easy it is for kids to log on and go oh how to build a sex room just kind of disgusting and again netflix is its own company it can do whatever it wants right now i feel like it's just flailing and trying to create shows that are inexpensive will bring in views because of shock factor but people who actually like genuine good content they are walking out of the door i'm not staying with netflix so that i can watch this what somebody else called cheap rubbish somebody put this uh meme and said fatherless behavior yeah you can describe a lot of things in our society by that this person said hbo max watching netflix collapse i love this gif of the guys walking with the casket it's true like i said their product catalog is getting rich just getting fully plumped as netflix decides to pump out trash why would people want to be seen on this by friends and family yeah that was my first thought the absolute horror i truly the audacity the do people have no shame or embarrassment i wouldn't who would want us have their mother be like oh i'm going to be on a reality tv show uh-uh even like dating shows absolutely not i have way too much pride for that remember what netflix used to be the platform that bought all the good shows that network tv cancelled yeah those are the good old days and then they started losing things to peacock that was like my the last straw when they got rid of the office that was big not happy uh also parks and rec that was a big loss so i do admire that the ceo is changing the culture memo is saying you need to get over your triggered sensitive behavior because you're working in media and things are gonna make you uncomfortable but it just so happens that when you start introducing and infiltrating things with wokeness trying to be overly politically correct the quality of the content will go down because it is not character-driven because it is not authentic because it is not actually genuine the common trope which even though is quippy is very true get woke go broke like that is exactly what happens and i'm not saying that it is because they started just doing a ton of very blatant political propaganda the whole streaming model is just getting absolutely blown up so i don't know if there's any way for netflix to save themselves at this point maybe they should just go back to their original model of sending out dvds could be an option i don't really know but either way i am so glad that we all have this wonderful list of shows that we can watch this july i am so excited to virtually watch and remarriage and desires with you all this will be fantastic is all hope loss i don't really know you guys can let me know do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "xLDI20KYhLs": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper today is a fantastic day it is Tuesday November 15th that is the day that I'm recording this and Pete Davidson has been trending for the last 24 hours now if you've been watching this show from the beginning you obviously saw my episodes about the Kanye and Pete drama while Pete Davidson was dating Kim Kardashian you know that I love talking about Pete Davidson and that's what we're gonna do today but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com to check out my merch collection I first learned about P Davidson when basically everybody else did when he joined SNL and at the beginning I honestly thought that he was adorable and so funny I was like oh this guy's so fun whatever he's so goofy and then he became more of a pop culture icon and just looked more and more like a basement dweller that never saw the light of day and I was like okay maybe not so much but that has not stopped other people and other women from fawning over him and I mean the guy is occasionally still funny so I guess I see it but when to talk about his latest girlfriend today because after Calling it Quits with Kim Kardashian he is now dating Emily ratajikowski here they are together basically every pop culture Instagram Twitter Tick Tock page is talking about this it's like when Pete Davidson even just goes to get coffee with somebody it's like the whole media world has to pause and see who it is and how many years older she is than him including myself so anyway now post his whole Kim Kardashian Whirlwind romance and you know run-ins with Kanye I feel like Pete has been laying low I have not heard much from him but now he's back and he's dating somebody that has actually been in the news a fair amount recently uh because of this Emily radajakowski came out as bisexual and she said that she does not believe in straight people because sexuality is just a sliding scale real straight people don't actually exist this was at the beginning of November there were a whole bunch of tick tocks I think I even mentioned her in one of my episodes and what she said about three people but now she is dating Pete so she's looking pretty straight great to me right now except Pete Davidson really isn't the most traditionally masculine man so I guess she's kind of getting the best of both worlds in a way I don't know I digress back to Pete per usual people cannot believe that he has pulled yet another beautiful like stunning and older woman now Emily Ratajkowski she is not older but she is older than him one woman tweeted and said you either date Pete Davidson or you have a baby with Nick Cannon those are the only two life paths for women or you go work for Elon Musk and you end up also having a baby with him those are the three those are the three killers of this generation another person said I can't believe Pete Davidson is dating Emily ratajikowski the ultimate end of the universe is when Taylor Swift and Pete Davidson inevitably pull each other into their orbits like two black holes colliding except right now I think Taylor Swift is basic is she engaged is she some people have speculated that she's already married to Joe I don't really know but either way I doubt that this is happening but if it did I would I would hang up my hat that would be the end that would be the Pinnacle of everything in the pop culture world people are also waiting their turn and expressing you know wanting to date Pete Davidson like a 81 year old Dion Warwick tweeted out and said I will be dating Pete Davidson next good for you Dion I saw these um memes and it was like it was Pete photoshopped into pictures with like dead celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and it's like Pete five minutes after getting into heaven it's like of course obviously another person said me waiting for my turn with Pete Davidson Lyft even jumped in because corporate accounts have just gotten spicy these days and said call her a lift or P Davidson will another person said my favorite part about Pete Davidson being seen with someone new is that they will always use the most deranged picture of him and then whoever he's with looking absolutely Flawless it's like why accentuate it we know it I mean accurate like look at this one under this retweet he looks like a freaking raccoon coming out of the dumpster that first post that I showed you from rap TV also not looking his best at all like he really needs some nimi skincare nimi skincare is one of the only skincare brands on the market that actively stands against cancer culture and wokeness with them you will never have to worry about the things that we have seen from Brands like Sephora and Ulta whether it be canceling conservative influencers or having trans women on podcasts talking about Fem femininity and motherhood when they are not actually biological women and on top of all of that enemy skin care actually works I have been exclusively using their products for almost a year now I absolutely love them I kind of do a combination of the hydrate and protect bundle and the daily glow up routine both of which I think could be very beneficial for Pete Davidson to try I don't know if Pete Davidson has ever seen an eye cream but you know what maybe skincare has one and I think you should try it and you know if you're feeling a bit raccoonish too which honestly is how I often feel in the morning then this is a great time to try these products go to nimiskincare.com use promo code Cooper at checkout for 15 off again that is nimiskincare.com promo code Cupra checkout and guys stay tuned because Black Friday is next week so I think you know what might be coming but anyway since Pete Davidson has not received any of his Emmy skincare yet people were obviously talking about his special looks somebody else said watching Pete Davidson bag solid tens while looking like a Chipotle bag it's a great way to put it another person said me checking for Pete Davidson before I take off from my girl's house very accurate and then other people wanted to discuss how this happens which really is the million dollar question like how does this man pull women like Ariana Grande and Kim Kardashian and Emily ratajikowski who's that Mom that he was dating the 40 year old woman a couple of years ago like the MILF Kate Beckinsale God it's it's insane but we're gonna talk about it so one person said Bay Davidson's Riz needs to be studied at Harvard and then put pictures of all these hot women I have seen raise referenced in this P Davidson thing and in other comment sections I had no idea what it was I didn't really want to look but finally last night I looked it up on Urban Dictionary was not as bad as I thought it's literally just another word for spitting game slash how good you are with pulling and sustaining  dab it's time to stop that was really embarrassing I'm so sorry but apparently that is what Pete Davidson has some people disagree though and said he doesn't have ribs they have bad taste can literally married Kanye oh that's tough but uh I mean Pete Davidson knows how to pull just saying so how does he get the girls the general consensus is that he is funny and women just want to date funny guys this girl said funny men get pretty girls another person said seeing how butthurt men get about Pete Davidson dating beautiful successful women is so silly to me like we've been telling y'all make us laugh be goofy treat us with kindness and it could all be so simple and then one of my friends Gina tweeted this and said Pete Davidson dating a string of beautiful women just confirms what we've been saying for years men don't need to be good looking just be sweet funny not fat and Rich and you'll always get the girl I mean it's pretty accurate now I do think that it is a tad more complex than that and I still think that Pete Davidson does look like a wet cigarette but I do think in the grand scheme of things he is better than the other wet cigarettes like Timothy Charlemagne chamomile whatever the frick his name is and Machine Gun Kelly I kind of put them all in the same category of wet cigarettes but Pete Davidson he's not trying to be anything he's not he leans into it he knows that he's like the best friend character the sidekick the goofy guy and you know maybe that's the key maybe you just need to be funny you need to be authentic you need to have money and maybe you just need to live in a basement because that's where P Davidson lives yeah I'm uh in Staten Island in my mom's basement crushing it I really have no idea but this truly is like the question of Our Generation thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make

drugs being hoodlums and the makeup has become very famous everybody wants to do euphoria makeup like a bunch of color and glitters that kind of thing it really has developed like a cult fandom and following in a way i'm not personally part of that but i have seen it unfold now one of the lead actors in this film is transgender uh hunter schaefer plays jules in the tv show and has become very famous for doing transgender activism talking about trans issues you know parading around as like the face of transgender entertainment whatever but beloved hunter has now gotten into a bit of a sticky mess oh no for commenting and liking on a certain post but before we get into it make sure that you like this video and if you are not subscribed to this channel yet i hope that this video wins you over and if you are interested in checking out my merch you can go to dailywire.com brett it is my first capsule i hope you all love it i've been so excited to see everybody ordering it and i'm very excited to see you all wearing it so this is the post that hunter responded to it was originally put on somebody's story and then the story got a lot of attention so they screenshotted it and made like a normal instagram post about it this is what it says i hope all of the people and bees okay first of all i'm already confused i don't even really remember what an envy is and b's nb is a person whose gender identity is not strictly male or female okay so an nb is just non-binary i guess we learn new things every day all right so here we go starting again i hope all of the people and bees who have fought to have trans identities no longer considered a medical condition that requires dysphoria are happy because you've won the red states are beginning to agree with you hrt and gender affirming surgery are no longer deemed medically necessary for adults in florida and it's not going to stop there that means more trans people have to pay for their transitions out of pocket forcing more of us into sex work that was quite a leap you made there um y'all just couldn't stand by to let binary trans people be the voice of this community you had to dismantle all of the guidelines around being trans to fit your narrative so that you could feel valid and then you demonized trans people who challenged your ideals and called them transcom transmedicalists what you don't understand is that binary trans women and men don't have the luxury of playing around with what it means to be trans the same way that you do you challenge gender identities from the safety of a cis body that requires no medical treatment we have to play the game and live by the guidelines that cis people have created for us because that is how we survive you are not helping you are not dismantling the gender binary you are not expanding the minds of cis people you are making them hate us for the last time i am begging non-binary people to take a seat and let binary trans people and more specifically black trans women be the voice of this community because they are the ones at risk i want to see that done as like a shakespearean monologue [Music] that was exhausting there's so much to unpack there first of all so much chaos but i think the gist of what this person is saying is that transgenderism used to be thought of as a medical condition gender dysphoria and some of those people would choose to get gender affirming surgeries and that was you know sometimes covered by insurance it was medically necessary because they were diagnosed with a condition now with the addition of non-binary people who are just kind of doing things willy-nilly basically playing dress-up in a way this person is arguing that they are making true transgenderism less serious which is why states like florida are saying these gender affirming surgeries aren't medically necessary anymore too many people are getting them insurance companies aren't going to pay that sort of thing i hope that made sense but that is basically what i'm getting for this well that's a funny way of putting it but i suppose so they end it by saying until we fix that issue quite frankly i don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about non-binary issues or the validity of their identity it is extremely narcissistic and tone-deaf uplift the voices of the people who need to be heard and protected then find some other avenue to get the attention you so desperately seek it's kind of based especially that last line because it is all about dress up and it is all about attention seeking anyway hunter schaefer liked the post and then commented exclamation point exclamation point expiration point exclamation point and people lost their mind but before we get into the comments if you're like me there are probably a lot of terms and references that were in that post that you didn't get and while i did try to summarize it i have an article here from newsweek that i just want to peruse with you because they tried to sum it up and they might be able to do it better than i can because they have spent a lot of time in a woke dictionary figuring this stuff out they say hunter schaefer is facing backlash on social media for appearing to agree with an instagram post about transmedicalism and the cutting of hrt which is hormone replacement therapy in certain states they go on to say that the post hunter was reacting to said that non-binary trans people are contributing to laws in certain states that no longer regard hrt and gender reaffirming surgery as medically necessary procedures and in many cases they were prior to this they go on to say that this school of thought is known as transmedicalism namely that being transgender is dependent upon experiencing gender dysphoria or requiring medical treatment to transition when did this become a school of thought that transgenderism was a medical condition i thought that the science was settled to use a fouchy line anyway so that is sort of what the post is talking about and that is sort of why people are so mad at hunter but that barely cleared anything up for me it really only just made me more angry what will you learn what will you learn but that gets me into the into the mood of these tweets that i'm about to read because people are pissed as [\u00a0__\u00a0] somebody said who's going to tell hunter schaefer that the real enemy are cis transphobes and not non-binary people that's the one that went really viral somebody else said hunter schaefer blaming non-binary people for the things happening to trans people's healthcare is so [\u00a0__\u00a0] sickening girl that is what conservatives want they want to divide you by making these horrific [\u00a0__\u00a0] laws and pitting queer and trans people against each other don't be a trans med okay first of all i'm sorry you guys are dividing yourselves there are so many gay and lesbian people who are going i don't want to be a part of this i just wanted to be able to you know date who i wanted to date and now you're trying to sterilize children i don't want to be a part of it you are causing this division yourself because you are going so radical and being extreme it's not the conservatives just saying somebody else said congrats to hunter schaefer for coming out as a [\u00a0__\u00a0] idiot succinct to the point uh it even made its way to tick tock we have a video here [Music] you know what actually makes me more angry than hunter schaefer liking a transmedicalist post it's people pretending that she didn't and it's pretending everyone's upset over non-binary people speaking over binary trans people that's not what people are upset about and you know that that post blames non-binary people for legislation attacking trans health care that post belittles non-binary people saying that they all have cis bodies that post literally ends they do i don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about non-binary people or their identity first off that ignores how many non-binary people do actually medically transition which is most of them it engages in the rhetoric that non-binary people aren't trans they are and it further alienates non-binary people from being trans people who make this constant distinction between binary and non-binary trans people they don't think non-binary people are trans it's just not socially acceptable to say anymore otherwise in a different way i guess that literally made me feel ill and stressed like i had a physical reaction in my chest to everything that this person was saying you just said that most non-binary people are transgender i'm sorry being transgender acknowledges that there is a binary that there is a man and a woman you are transitioning from one to the other non-binary is like i'd have nothing which one is it those are two completely distinct things if they are not a gender then what are they transitioning to a blob i just everything about that it's just ridiculous but back to twitter somebody said hunter schaefer hating non-binary people was not on my bingo card but it is so rich white woman of her also rooted in the idea that non-binary people are just trans light and therefore less deserving of affirming care and that's very harmful mentality that we need to dismantle heart uh somebody else said a white woman is a white woman before anything else hunter schaefer regardless of being trans has chosen to align herself with white and or cis people and place blame on non-binary people it is very easy to pick a scapegoat instead of challenging your own internalized transphobia yes the trans woman has internalized transphobia because they are a white woman that makes sense somebody else said i know hunter schaefer didn't make that post but whoever did was insane for it ron desantis is now going thanks so much for your valuable input sock he it i will now ban trans health care for everyone he hates all of us equally no ron desantis does not hate you he hates sterilizing children that are not mature enough to make educated medical decisions for themselves he hates you pushing a very weird sexual gender identity on children he really just wants to protect children and keep taxpayers from having to pay for all of that [\u00a0__\u00a0] it's not really about you which i know is shocking for a lot of people to realize these days somebody else said whenever hunter schaefer is trending every online trans person under the age of 22 gets drafted into a discourse war that's way worse than any actual war i mean that's a bit tone-deaf to say the least but not unexpected from this crowd of people but apparently it is some kind of discourse war probably because they're all unstable from watching euphoria and becoming emotionally invested in it just kidding i could actually care less about the show i'm sure i have viewers that really love it it just wasn't pleasant for me and i could not get past the first two episodes it just stressed me out but anyway if you need any more indication that these people have truly lost it here's one last comment hunter schaefer okay now that i have your attention please number one wear a mask number two do not attend non-essential large social gatherings number three demand that our institutions prioritize public health and number four non-binary people are not to blame for republican eliminationist [\u00a0__\u00a0] there's a new word eliminationist never heard that one before but i mean listen what are those first two like i feel like i did an okay job explaining the earlier situation what the post was about but there were a lot of nuances and words and definitions and phrases that i truly did not understand and honestly i don't really want to spend the time and my precious energy dissecting them but the real message here is that these people have truly lost it the left will always turn on each other they will always eat their own i'm gonna start eating each other out there if you divert from the mainstream appropriate narrative even in the slightest you will be canceled you will be attacked you will be doxxed just like hunter schaefer is i mean you can't even be a regular human with your own opinions and your own takes on things in your own nuances which honestly just goes to show how far our culture has strayed from one that uplifted and promoted freedom of thought and diversity of opinion it's sad and it's frightening to be honest hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "J_FppWTHjkY": "here's the thing bruce i'm great at controlling my anger i do it all the time but when i'm catcalled in the street when incompetent men explain my own area of expertise to me i do it really because if [Music] welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper we're talking about superheroes yet again i have done this like five times in the last two weeks i know more about marvel and dc now than i have ever known in my entire life so i hope that i am making sheller proud i hope that i am making my viewers proud with my extended expanded knowledge it's only day three but i understand how the whole world works now i'm expanding like the marvel universe is expanding phase four i learned about that today there's like a phase four of the marvel universe and apparently the new she-hulk tv show is part of it so that's what we're gonna be talking about today the first episode of this fantastic tv show came out on the 18th so at the end of last week and nothing about that is good apparently just as a reminder i thought we would all watch the trailer again i did that on a live stream about a month and a half ago but so we're all on the same page let's just take a gander but before we get into it you guys know the drill make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already you can go check out my merch at dailywire.com brett and make sure that you ring the notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode alright i don't know if you want to shield your eyes for this nothing about it is explicit it's just painful to be honest being a superhero is a trial by fire who's gonna protect the world if not people like you transformations are triggered by anger and fear those are like the baseline of any woman just existing oh i'm gonna die yes yes yes no no you could be an avenger oh i'm not a superhero that is for billionaires and narcissists and adult orphans for some reason [Music] is there anything more depressing than dating in your 30s yeah this is the best date i've had in a while oh should we split some fries let's get those to go god so there's no hope for marvel they're so cucked she's literally carrying this man to bed like this isn't the wokest woke thing that i've ever seen but i think we can all clearly see that this was written and produced and starring some kind of angry feminist and it is going to have the angry woman agenda she literally turns into the hulk when she's scared or has rage and you saw that line that's like the baseline of all women like is that literally going to be the entire show apparently it is we'll get into that in a second even before it came out people had some serious thoughts and they were not positive because after seeing you know the trailer and the stills and different clips from the promotions audiences started slamming the tv show for the poor quality of the cgi and the vfx like y'all if you thought her skin was so bad don't blame the animators just get her some nimmy skin care and the best part is unlike the she-hulk nimmy actually cares about the issues concerning real women like our skin the most important thing because i promise you nimmy skin care products will make your skin look real and natural and healthy unlike the she-hulk cgi and on top of all of that mimi's skin care isn't woke so you're getting great products with great value so go to nimmyskincare.com and to get 15 off use promo code cooper at checkout again that is nimmyskincare.com promo code cooper at checkout i think it's a little too late to send she-hulk some skincare which is probably why the director made a statement trying to pawn off the terrible vfx and cgi on the patriarchy literally this was at the beginning of the month and gamespot tweeted out this video but they said the director of marvel's she-hulk has responded to the internet backlash towards the show's cgi strap in folks you know in terms of the cgi being critiqued i do think that has to do with our culture's belief in their ownership of women's bodies i think that a lot of the critique comes from feeling like they're able to tear apart the cgi women there's a lot of talk about her body type and you know we based her on a lot of olympic athletes and not bodybuilders but i think if we'd gone the other way we would be facing the same critique oh wait you're serious let me laugh even harder now obviously i have seen some tweets where people are upset that she is not as big as the hulk all of that stuff but setting all of that aside people are less angry about the design and they are more angry about the execution because whether she is big or small or what her body type looks like the cgi just isn't good so even if she was as big as the hulk probably still would not look very good and you can't pawn that off onto the patriarchy in society's ownership of women come on are we surprised that the director is blaming this on the patriarchy the ownership of women i mean that is just a classic leftist tactic if there is a problem it is never their fault they never you know messed up the cgi budget they never you know gave their cgi people enough time to do the animation no it's systemic sexism it's the patriarchy it's misogyny it's all the things that are outside of their control if you would just take some personal responsibility have some accountability in your life i promise you things will fall into place and you will be a happier person like lady you should try that sometime bargain basement no no she also did an interview to her credit where she was talking about how the animators were overworked and didn't have enough time and obviously a lot of that comes down from you know studio pressure and like bigger budgets that kind of thing but you know ma'am you are the director you don't get to excuse away the critiques like that like you overworked them you should have fought for a bigger budget and if your vfx artists were actually overworked then stick with that story don't change the narrative and try to blame it on society like you're making nobody believe you anyway the comments under this gamestop video were so based somebody said ownership of women hello what the i can't say what i really think or i gotta go through the twitter ban appeal again but next time find a six foot four female bodybuilder and paint her green example at least try i love that people think that just painting a woman green would look better than this poor vfx like that's kind of depressing it's it's awful to your point the entire wnba is available to you next time somebody else said ah what a loser deflecting criticism and making it about some woke diatribe these hacks are beyond predictable exactly like are we surprised no never this is just another part of the standard leftist tactic that is specific to hollywood where they you know remake a film or tv show making it woke where they make some woke production that is terrible quality because they're prioritizing the political agenda over the quality of the project and then when it flops they turn around and they blame audiences for not being woke enough and progressive enough to accept it nothing can go wrong oh no it all went wrong no you just made a terrible project can you at least admit it another person commented and said ah yes bad cgi not due to overworked and underpaid vfx workers but due to misogyny again i really appreciated these comments but anyway that's not all once the show came out which was this past weekend people started pointing out how woke it actually is so now we're not just talking about her you know carrying a man to the bedroom and the bad cgi people are actually going okay this is terrible but you know considering the trailer we already saw in the comments from the director i'm not surprised that it is apparently as progressive as people are saying matt walsh posted this clip over the weekend he said there is literally no audience for a whiny feminist superhero and yet they keep producing this anyway like have any of the feminist adaptations done well i don't think so and yet they keep pouring money at it to appease the one percent which is basically the way our entire society operates at this point uh but here's the clip here's the thing bruce i'm great at controlling my anger i do it all the time when i'm catcalled in the street when incompetent men explain my own area of expertise to me i do it pretty much every day because if i don't i will get called emotional or difficult or might just literally get murdered so i'm an expert at controlling my anger because i do it infinitely more than you well that's just lazy writing wow she sounds pleasant she sounds like a happy peppy woman like are you kidding me what is this crap you're not gonna get murdered if you fight back against a man splainer if you actually stand up for yourself you'll probably get more respect than just being a whiny little feminist brat just saying she's saying this to the hulk didn't the hulk like watch his mother die i think that's a bigger deal than being cat called on the street i think he is better at controlling his hurt and his rage and his anger than you are if the biggest problem in your life is being cat-called and his face clearly shows that somebody's zoomed in on it her telling this to hulk is pretty funny like he can even hide the fact that he's bothered by this because she knows she's full of crap why are we still here [Music] just to suffer my friend common replied to this and he said it sounds like a 14 year old tumblr feminist wrote this which is true feels like one of those infographics that people are still posting on instagram where it's like you don't understand like i'm so scared to go out into the world and somebody's gonna look at me weird like okay carry a gun if you're that concerned i do i don't complain about it this person is ridiculous first of all their profile picture is the she-hulk and then their username is jennifer walter's lawyer jennifer walter is she-hulk they say captain marvel was too cocky black widow was mediocre miss marvel was too childish wanna is unredeemable mighty thor was pushing an agenda she-hulk is anti-men i'm sensing a pattern and it's called misogyny maybe it's just that all these films and tv shows were terrible ever thought of that jennifer walter's lawyer no further questions critical drinker who's an awesome and super based movie reviewer go check out his channel if you have not seen it already he had a great reply and he said let me fix it for you sweetheart captain marvel was a block of wood black widow ruined a great character miss marvel was irrelevant wanda really was irredeemable mighty thor wasted a promising plot arc she-hulk is anti-comedy that's a much better way to put it and usually when you insert feminist agendas into a comedy it becomes not funny there's a reason why people say like girls aren't funny like maybe it's not the women's fault it's just the fact that every narrative that they're inserted in is about their oppression and their plight and the only thing that they know to talk about is feminist issues the message nobody cares that doesn't come off as empowering that comes across as and whiny and preachy nobody cares and it's not just saying it's not that people don't like women in film and tv like we need female characters i'm not saying we need them in every single scene and every whatever it's just a fact women exist they're going to be in film and tv but it's that hollywood writes the most obnoxious women and crams them into every narrative and then makes those narratives entirely about their struggles and oppression maybe just focus on the characters and their relationships not trying to prove how woke and virtuous you are i think audiences would appreciate that that's all is hulk marvel okay cool you're like me that's how max just start the video hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "IKQ1ZbM3OGI": "ooh commoners oh my God I've seen him always so weird oh no no hey welcome back to another episode of off the clock my producers have put a jubilee video in front of me and I am already weirded out I'm going to be reacting to this video it is called confident or creepy feminists confront pickup artists and the first guy all right I already know who he is he's confidence Chris on tick tock there is like this genre of dudes and they pull up their phones and they do these videos they're like guys if you want to get a girl you got to be like this you got to do this that you just gotta slide it you got to do all this whatever and it is like I can't even listen to what they are saying to see if it is worthwhile whether it is intelligent whether whether it is actually good advice for men because the way that they portray themselves is so slimy and slick and creepy if you want people to listen to you and respect you and take you seriously don't act like a weird douchebag also this is just like popped into my mind the other genre of men on Tech talk and on Instagram that really weirds me out and I apologize if any of you guys follow me here and subscribe the like only I call it only pans it's like the sexualized cooking videos and it's all the men and they're like slapping bread dough and they have like really um like that and these guys I'm already like not having a good time sheller why are you making me do this I'm sweating ah all right here we go here we go guys this is confidence Chris on Tick Tock dear God I'm confident Chris on Tick Tock the reason I think I give good dating advice is because I know what the toxic guy thinks because I have been that guy what's your opinion on feminists you know I like to think I'm a feminist I've quit feminism shut up God huge red flag for me as any guy who's I'm a feminist no you're not you just want to get laid it's literally it confidence Chris it's not what you want to hear it's what you need to hear okay you can schedule a phone call with him for an hour for 250 dollars what okay all right I know this one's gonna be bad because it's a podcast and men in podcasts don't go go well together to be honest as a girl you be with whoever the [\u00a0__\u00a0] you want to be right there should be guys in life that you're like you know I [\u00a0__\u00a0] with you but realistically you're not that cool and I'm down to just [\u00a0__\u00a0] you I don't think you should hold back I honestly don't think you should hold back if you want a guy because he's hot and he doesn't have anything else going on for him no I understand where the opinion's coming from but I don't really like the language because it's like objectifying women as like a sexual object okay now this is confusing because I guarantee this woman is like pro-choice sexual Liberation whatever but then they get mad when men respond and use them as sexual objects it's like in their mind they believe that only we are allowed to sexualize ourselves we can portray ourselves as sexual objects we can walk around with our hoochie mama asses sticking out and our boobs flailing all around with the moment a guy looks at them toxic masculinity that's in that's misogyny whatever no you are portraying yourself like that obviously you are going to cultivate this culture of men who looks at you simply as a sexual object you cause that problem you have done that yourself sorry I like cut her off before she really got to speaking but that like bothered me okay like I wouldn't I wouldn't talk about a man like that um there's nothing wrong with wanting to somebody just because you want to [\u00a0__\u00a0] them you don't have to always be looking for a relationship and that goes for men and women it's your life that's fine but I don't think we should be walking around pretending like that's healthy for anybody but again everything that this like confidence Chris guy is saying and like oh it's fine women just want to go like around whatever he's basically just regurgitating what women say in the first place which is really sad kind of look at them as if it was like you're just your home so you're talking to somebody and it's like okay like we're just having a regular ass why does he have a whiteboard is he like a therapist now treating them as if you've known them for almost a very long time not being afraid to just talk to them like they're a normal person you know what I mean that's really what it comes down to your friends yes A Friend friend look at her like she's an ugly chick you had me until the end promoting confidence in people that's great uh but like talk to everybody as if they're a friend they don't need to be an ugly person to talk to them with kindness and understanding like just get to know people that's all you have to do at the end of the day he's just sexualizing women constantly and apparently according to him the only way that you can treat somebody with decency and kindness as a friend is making them ugly in your mind and you know who's to blame for that a lot of the time is the women who sexualize themselves constantly and walk around like and then like get angry if men want to have sex with them God the society is so what was he even talking about in that video he was he giving advice to that couple okay you know what is lost in this current dating landscape writing letters like why

are taking their bbls out now there was this whole article where it was like heroin cheek is back in the Kim the Kardashians are getting rid of their bbls they're getting skinny again everybody needs to lose weight women just walk around trying to like morph our bodies to fit into whatever pop culture is saying we need to look like calm down I like that he's saying it with the bbls it's just ridiculous stop trying to like change yourself to be sexually an enticing for stupid men like this okay I'm personally not really for the bbls but if they're making women if women want to do that and want to look that way then it's not really up to like this person or this guy to decide that it's in or out I mean tribal tattoos are out and he still has these moving on I think it's less about him saying like these are in or these are out for women and more just saying like you don't have to do that but I doubt that that's the point he was actually making that's the point that I'm making is don't feel like you have to like inject your ass with stuff okay do not give away your excess for cheap it's given feminist you hold your access you really want a guy to like you a lot you make it hard yeah think about the feeling you have when you hike a small Mountain you're like all right I don't care but like think about the feeling you would have if you climbed Mount Everest now imagine the same thing about the way a guy was trying to go after you if you make it Mount Everest they're going to appreciate you a lot more I see the logic actually that wasn't terrible that was not like awful advice it's interesting because he kind of puts women in these two categories of like just frown do whatever you know go get go get your o or whatever he was saying and then he's also like well if you actually want a guy to like you you need to hold out a bit I mean that's not the greatest language to use but yeah you shouldn't give it all away now even though we live in this hypersexualized culture I do believe that if you're not you know sleeping around on the first date socially there will be more respect there even the most sexualized people that is a sign of hey I actually really like you I care about you I'm gonna have more respect for the situation and I think it does go both ways even the fact that we are absolutely like deranged we live in a degenerate Society I think that belief is still out there but I think everyone is different it's all a case-to-case thing I do not agree with that at all I feel like this kind of video is kind of is Insidious and its impacts because it's saying to women like oh you know make things harder but what that message sends to men is oh it's not that she isn't interested in me that no didn't really mean no that no actually meant try harder and that's a lot more dangerous of a narrative so is this girl saying that like a man shouldn't try to win her over because that's dangerous that makes her more of an object I saw this video recently and it was this woman it was like very sad and depressed and probably just came off of a divorce or something like that and she was saying that like all of these conservative women they're happy being objects they're happy being chased by men and being a conquest no wanting a man to show interest in you and persevere even if you're not wanting to sleep around on the first day that's not saying I'm an object that's saying I have self-respect that's not dangerous at all Chris I think you might just be a little young I don't know how old you are but I um some of these things like don't give away your access for cheap they just feel kind of like you have blinders on it you're only thinking from your point of view when there's like so many point of views today in talking to him sure I'd give it a shot hey nice to meet you what's going on hi how's it going Chris oh you'd be taller oh he's so short I get that a lot yeah hello short King oh Jesus Christ yeah you give me a hug oh my God I know you only saw a handful of the videos but I think I've actually seen your stuff on Tick Tock that's why I think I was confused because I've seen um stuff on like your other stuff on Tick Tock that actually gave really advice I think that's like the issue though is that like a lot of people do see these like quick things they make one second judgment and then they're just like yeah I mean that's a problem with the internet would you say that any of my videos I think you said one of them was Insidious not intentionally Insidious but I do think a potential to bring the wrong message to the wrong people gotcha which is what I'm saying like because like I don't think you come from a bad place you don't no you don't strike me as one of those Bad Dudes who's like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] red pill no you're not one of those guys those bad conservative red pills um there might be a little bit of blinders on in certain areas that's fair I mean I would agree with that I mean yeah his blinders are that he's only thinking about sex all of these conversations are about sex it's like okay well you're not actually talking about meaningful relationships and what goes into that you're just giving advice about how to screw around basically I hear a lot of these comments like online but then just like hearing it from people directly is just a different experience you're like that's not what I intended I think hearing all those different perspectives like honestly in a weird way helps me like think about or make the content I make because I'm like what I'm saying is not necessarily what they're picking up to be honest that's my new thing is that I'm trying to like date a girl it's like six foot you know what I'm saying I'd be like yo can you get that like box of Cheerios for me yeah I don't think that this guy is necessarily bad I'm not some raging feminist so I think my critique of him was obviously very different than the people that we just saw I do think that he kind of has a one-track mind and so my critiques of him would come from the fact that I don't think that way but he seems like a fine guy nice little short King I don't think he's doing any harm he's not some kind of misogynistic toxic threat like these feminists probably thought there you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribed to this Channel and ring

you to miss a thing", "G3UFXEITrBE": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper so last week we talked about one euphoria star that's hunter schaefer we went through that whole ordeal with them but now there is yet another euphoria star who is trending on social media and while the situations are very different it's the same group of people that are mad at both of these actresses now before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already you can check out my merch collection at dailywire.com brett and as always make sure you ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode okay so the actress in question is sydney sweeney she is super popular she's cute she's blonde she i think worked on cars during covid and i remember watching her tick tocks when she was you know fixing her bronco in her parents like auto shop all that stuff she seems down to earth nice anyway she is on euphoria and this is the post that started it all here she is with her family and a little cowgirl outfit she said no better way to celebrate my mama than a surprise hoedown a lot of people liked it the comments initially were very positive but as you will soon see things took a turn for the worst so a little background she is from northern idaho and most of her family still lives in the coeur d'alene area some live in spokane washington i believe and she threw a surprise hoe down for her mom's 60th birthday which was last week and a few days after the event she did this whole recap on her instagram so she did all of these story posts thanking the different vendors and this is how they pulled it off they did these custom cakes and these custom shirts whatever and then she did this post saying this was so much fun you know thank you everybody for coming out whatever and did this carousel of posts and people were quick to sort through the family's photos and ignore the cute decor and the smiling faces whatever and just focus on this one shirt in the second image her father's thin blue lined t-shirt the rampage started immediately so before the night was over sydney was already putting out a response tweet and it was actually very non-confrontational she said you guys this is wild an innocent celebration for my mom's milestone 60th birthday has been turned into an absurd political statement which was not the intention please stop making assumptions much love to everyone and happy birthday mom i have no problem with this statement i actually really really like it she's not bashing her family she's not turning against her father she's not making any accusations she's not letting her politics be known she is just putting the focus back on her mom and saying get over it it's not that big of a deal which is very true and while i think anyone with common sense would see this as kind and fair and move on most people on the internet don't have common sense hence they did not have that response to the tweet so they started doing some digging they went to her brother's page and scrolled through his photos and saw this uh which is a photo of him at the same party and apparently these are some family members and they are wearing maga esque hats this post though was up for a week before he went in and edited the caption and limited the comments so people would stop attacking him because even though these hats look magga or whatever they say make 60 great again and that's why he edited the caption to say the hats say make 60 great again anyway this picture then added fuel to the fire because people knew that she planned the party so then they assumed that she obviously made those hats to make some political statements so obviously she and her family are conservative and obviously everybody has to cancel her dear god can people not just have a birthday party for their mother without people getting their panties in a bunch is all i'm asking and the most ridiculous thing is i know the people on the left use trump's slogan the maga hat the make america great again it is now a pop culture thing like make america gay again i had a really good friend in high school that literally wore that shirt almost every week and i know that you guys have your own spins on the maga hats it's literally not that big of a deal uh but obviously other people do not have that opinion somebody said seeing sydney sweeney get jumped is beautiful if you're white and unwilling to completely shame your parents for their conservative views you're just as complicit and need to be escorted out [Applause] yeah go shame your parents you seem like you live a happy loving life another person said unless sydney sweeney forces her parents to vote for joe biden at gunpoint i can no longer in good conscious stand her tv show about high school or snorting heroin out of each other's mouths that's actually a very good way to describe euphoria just saying it's tweets like this where i really don't know if people are being satirical or not like do you actually want her to force her family to change her political opinions because now she's like a public liberal figure no that's ridiculous another person said this sydney sweeney business literally shows that white people are not holding their family members accountable at home okay now we go we're bringing race into it [Music] uh your activism is performative because if not at home then where else if not the white people in your lives closest to you then who else also i did some research on sydney sweeney and she's barely ever made a political statement she has not done crazy activism she doesn't post the infographics maybe she's done like a couple of stories or something that i haven't seen because i don't follow her closely but she's not a political figure and now suddenly people are saying that everything that she does has been fake like what has she done she's just been being an actress being a normal girl working on her bronco hanging out in idaho like leave her alone people started making these tweets like where was sydney sweeney's family members on the night of january 6 2021 again you got that from a thin blue line t-shirt maybe the guy was a cop maybe her dad is an ex-cop we don't know you literally do not need to make everything political obviously that thin blue line flag has been turned political but to start with it was just showing support for police there's a reason why there's a thin green line there's a thin red line for firemen it is not political to start with you guys caused that then some less ridiculous people started coming out of the woodwork thankfully somebody said if the politics of sydney sweeney's parents shock you you're gonna be pretty disappointed when you find out the politics of most white people's parents but especially the famous ones i mean i do hate how people on the left immediately assume that if you're right-wing then you are a white boomer or vice versa like it's just a very outdated take but i still appreciate the fact that this person is not attacking sydney and just saying maybe her parents have those beliefs shocking really another person said has the thought crossed anyone's mind that it's possible that sydney sweeney strongly disagrees with the politics of her parents just like an enormous proportion of millennials gen z she isn't responsible for her family's ideas any more than you are leave her alone there you go i mean or god forbid she could also be conservative or lean more right nope nope stop talking go to jail shocking i know the entire thing it's like people are taking this crumb and turning it into an entire cake because they have no lives and all that they do is sit on the internet trying to pick people apart for having a certain point of view and offering nothing of substance to the conversation because it's not like sydney sweeney came out with a whole post about politics or was trying to you know step into the political arena it's literally a birthday party it is so ridiculous another person said people are really trying to cancel sydney sweeney because she has conservative family members most of us who are not from la have conservative family members you weirdos yeah okay well you weirdo some of us are from la and our right wing so there you have it uh another person said i simply will not participate in the canceling of cindy sweeney her breasts are fantastic and she is too hot i mean there was a whole fiasco with her family a couple of months ago because her grandmother gave a statement to a newspaper and said that her granddaughter had the best tits in hollywood so listen i like your family already they seem entertaining uh and i appreciate that this person just does not care this girl ashley also has the right attitude she said oh sydney sweeney might have conservative family members okay lol anyway like guys it's that simple it's lit it's like who cares sydney through a fantastic birthday party for her mom they looked like they had a nice time she posted some pictures for all of us to enjoy because all of us would have loved to be at a party like that basically and maybe she's secretly conservative and if she is i hope that she is brave enough to not bow to the mob and not cave and continue working because we do need conservatives in hollywood and if she's not which is totally fine i have just as much respect for her and her family because they figured out how to bridge the divide and still come together for life's big moments and that is how it should be and that's how it was for many years until everybody decided to lose their damn minds we can all just take a step back and love one another even if we disagree on some things go get a job get off the internet and stop tweeting at 3am about people's personal lives it's pretty simple do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i

here on out become a national holiday and here's why because Anthony fauci has announced that he is retiring from his position oh my God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Victory he has been the director of the National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases for literally decades as well as being an advisor to many presidents starting with Ronald Reagan and after all of this time he's finally out but it's not immediate he released his statement on August 22nd which is why I believe it should be a holiday but he will be finishing out the year and officially leaving in December so that's when the real celebration will begin obviously in my mind I'm thinking okay it looks like there's going to be a red wave he does not want to face any more heat from Rand Paul maybe he wants to get out but at the same time and some people pointed this out on Twitter do we really have ballsy enough Republicans that will actually investigate him and everything with kovid but you know the midterms are coming up maybe we're clearing house getting some new folks in I mean Liz Cheney is out Brian stelter just got booted from CNN Don Lemon might be getting booted from CNN things are happening so you know we'll see but before we get into the meat of this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring that Bell so that you never miss a comment section episode and of course the first capsule by merch collection is out now you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check it out all right I'm so excited about this I hate this little man he's such a slimy little troll man Disclose TV tweeted out and said Justin Dr fauci announced his resignation as niaid director and chief medical advisor to Biden and then here is his little statement that he released he said I am announcing today that I'll be stepping down from the positions of director of the National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases and chief of the niaid laboratory of immunoregulation as well as the position of chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden I'll be leaving these positions in December of this year to pursue the next chapter of my career now this is an important note he is not retiring and writing off into the sunset into some jail cell where maybe he should be no he is just leaving this position and is going to take his medical expertise and passions elsewhere he goes on to say that it was the honor of a lifetime to serve in this position and all of the presidents that he served and here he continues about his future plans he says while I am moving on from my current positions I am not retiring hormone not all come on man don't worry you simp cucked Americans who love him after more than 50 years of government service I plan to pursue the next phase of my career while I still have so much energy and passion for my field and one of the scariest things to me is that he's talking in this statement about training future scientists to fight against these future infectious diseases like my God does that mean we're going to be back in lockdown again if so you need to start investing in precious metals and the best way to do that is

the power of Science and investments in research and Innovation the world has been able to fight deadly diseases to help save lives around the globe I am proud to have been a part of this important work and look forward to helping to continue doing so in the future good riddance to you Anthony the first tweet that I saw was from Greg price who is fantastic if you're not following him you should be and this really just hits the nail on the head he said the legacy of Dr fauci will forever be a grandparent dying alone in a hospital room while he does another photo shoot for a magazine cover I mean we're bringing down the mood here but that's as clear as you can get and in case you've forgotten about the photo shoots that he did while the economy was shut down we were locked in our homes kids were kept out of school we were forced to be vaccinated and masked and people were left alone to die in hospital rooms here's your reminder in style the king of swagger Dr Anthony fauci and then of course he was a times person of the year I believe one of the 100 most influential people his face makes me angry it's just it's just disgusting and if you're new here and you're wondering why his little p face makes me so angry well it might be because of the flip-flopping nature of his science trademark where he said the science was settled when obviously it was not the authoritarian nature of his recommendations to our government about how to beat kovid the fact that he gained millions of dollars and his Fame skyrocketed over the last three years his connections to gain of function research I don't know those are just a few that I could name off the top of my head speaking of the flip-flopping nature somebody tweeted out and said I'm sure he'll change his guidance on this as well give him a month yeah he'll be like never mind I'm not retiring Biden needs me do you know how good it is to have you back in this office no they're both senile old men he's 81. why do we have so many old people in government like please go live in a Margaritaville you've lived long enough and made enough money in government shoo fly move on another account tweeted out and said it looks like fauci's career won't survive another winter of death do you guys remember that where the White House sent out that memo saying that if you're unvaccinated you will be facing a a winter of severe illness and death somehow I survived siraj uh tweeted out lighting my statue prayer candle in memoriam rest in peace Dr fauci now obviously siraj is not a simp for fauci but so many people are you can just go on sites like Redbubble and Etsy and you can see fauci prayer candles fauci bobbleheads fouchy artwork fouchy posters fouchy costumes and if you really want to see the Pinnacle of all of this you can watch the fauci documentary which I did for some idiotic reason and he has a painting of himself above his desk in his office you can get one of those too in case you're wondering another woman tweeted something and said fauci is retiring I'd like to offer him a hearty congratulations on a remarkable career few have been so wrong so often and yet continue to hold positions of power and few have been so overtly narcissistic and yet commanded the admiration of half the country it's really remarkable it really is shocking like I don't know how the man did it I mean I do know how the man did it because he instilled fear in the hearts and minds of every American and gained incredible government power and made the entire American government cucked to him that's how we did it in my mind I see this as being part of the global plan to make us all incredibly dependent upon the government he was just upon in that scheme and he benefited from it and we all became dependent have you seen anything that happened in the last three years and obviously there are many people outside of my corner of the internet who did not have this you know more based response to the news which Tucker Carlson actually described perfectly in this segment you have to watch because it's super funny welcome to Tucker Carlson imagine the pandemonium at SoulCycle Studios across the Northeast this morning when Tony fauci announced his retirement ugly doesn't begin to describe it picture the chaos if you can in the organic chaga aisle at Whole Foods in Brookline try to Envision the panic and hysteria that must have broken out at espresso bars in Edgar town in Aspen and Santa Monica and Bethesda is thousands of masked ladies and Lululemon discovered all at once that the one religious leader they still revered their own even tinier version of The Dalai Lama had decided to retreat forever from public life it was ladies and gentlemen the equivalent of a targeted nuclear device detonated over the most emotionally vulnerable elements of our most privileged population you can picture the Carnage The Whaling the swooning manicured hands clutch to breasts then fumbling for Xanax and expensive handbags I mean he's making a joke but he's not wrong these people literally have worshiped fauci for the last three years it's the reason why bobble heads and prayer candles exist in honor of him they have literally not stepped out of their house until fauci says that it is okay I mean how is our society gotten so weak so soft-minded that you have to wait and get permission from like a five foot two 81 year old man before you do anything in your life it's sad it is very sad and wild Tucker is joking about this the best humor is honest and this is a hundred percent honest he was right because the elite Democrats are all crying I'm gonna kill myself especially some of our favorites like Barack Obama he said I will always be grateful that we had a once in a century Public Health leader to guide us through a once in a century pandemic few people have touched more lives than Dr fauci and I'm glad he's not done yet I don't really like that line has touched more lives than Dr fauci yeah he's touched some lives in not good ways maybe that was very tactful on Obama's part to not make it positive or negative because then people can read it however they want because he certainly has impacted some lives that did not continue living and I'm sort of laughing when I say that but it's because if I'm not laughing I'm going to cry President Biden from the POTUS account tweeted out and said I know Dr fauci is a dedicated public servant with wisdom and insight honed over decades at the Forefront of our most challenging Public Health crises as he leaves this role like send my thanks for his service America is stronger more resilient and healthier because of him literally none of those things are true we are not stronger I just said that we are literally weak-minded because we are at the beck and call of a five foot two little doctor man we are not more resilient people are still hiding in their homes freaking out they are socially inept now that they've been locked in their house for three years and we are not healthier have you seen the Obesity crisis in this country instead of saying hey take your vitamin D take your zinc go out and get sunlight exercise your way through this pandemic take care of your family if you start getting sick take some Airborne take some emergency no instead go sit on your couch watch Tiger King and eat fluffy coffee and fed up Tick Tock pasta that was basically the advice that was given so no Biden I reject your assumption now the last one I have here just a good one he says thank you Dr fauci for three decades of Public Service to America those of us who are not brainwashed by fox stand with you you were a voice of Sanity amidst DT's chaos you are a true American hero and I'm brainwashed by Fox like can you guys get a better tagline like that is so outdated and he's not a true American hero in any sense of the word uh so I just want to wrap out this episode with a more uplifting message this is a throwback from DeSantis and he was kind of predicting this incredible moment and he mentioned fauci being kicked out of his post but you know fauci retiring it still makes me dressed as happy so enjoy because sometimes people will ask me oh man how come Florida 84 000 jobs the rest of the country you know what what could be done to help the rest of the country and I say well you know the saying that I always think back and it's a little bit of a flourish on how it's been used previously but a recession is when your neighbor loses his job a depression is when you lose yours recovery is when Dr fauci loses his good night guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a video see

popcorn which can only mean one thing I'm back in sheller's house which also can only mean one thing um because you only come over to Charlotte's house for one reason and that's to watch movies uh to be totally honest because look at this place makes sense anyway we're gonna watch another Star Wars film I was about to say the name of it but I actually don't know which one it is it's the next one I gotta hear you guess attack of the Clone is that one is that something what's that wrong second one what what what is attack isn't that a thing though yeah attack of the Clones is the second one in the prequel trilogy okay well at least I knew I was at least it's the name of a movie um this one is what was the first one called well okay is that it oh Empire Strikes Back okay it's the first one like the Rebellion well no the first one was actually just called Star Wars but then like a couple years later when like Lucas basically rebranded them so they would have episodes oh yeah and then he called it Star Wars episode four A New Hope oh right I would have never even that makes sense I'll let it hear it but okay Empire Strikes Back this is back I obviously think of Star Wars I don't know I probably have seen clips from it but I can't tell you anything that goes on in this film in the slightest it's the best one 100 that's what you have been saying it was interesting in the comments of the first Star Wars video we did there were a lot of people they were going no it's not like you're shallow you're wrong but of course he had some backup from other people who agree with him so yeah those people were wrong that said otherwise okay well ah now I as the Star Wars Authority I will give you an objective clear authoritative answer about whether I think this one is better and then by the third movie I'll be able to tell you which one of the three is best uh and you can hear it for me because obviously I'm right about everything um but anyway let's go ahead and get into the film I'm very excited let's do it all right the coffee's ready [Music] thank you so not only is this my favorite Star Wars movie this is probably one of my favorite movies probably in my top five favorite movies okay the Vader is alive but I don't know how well I remember at the end of the the last one Han Solo shot the Tie Fighter and then a blue Darth Vader out of orbit and so he just kind of went on he was already flying yes what's that that is a star destroyer it wasn't the last one remember the beginning of the movie when well it was chasing what she was on there's a lot more votes than this one though over oh I didn't know Rocky was in this movie that's so mean you know what it looks like um Rocky no does that look like my dog like if Rocky was 20 times bigger you look like a Wampa it looks like the matter of horn in Disney or actually climbered up I think it's so much better looking than Luke Skywalker so much objectively well she also age better there was a reason for that scene that just happened with Luke and this monster in between the original Star Wars and this one Mark Hamill got into really bad car accident like half his face fell off so so he looks a little different and they had to explain why he looks different sort of so they did that scene yes that hair is so much better than the Buns not as iconic it's you know what makes her look less round yeah the graphics are so bad stop motion animation this is so good I love this part I love the music I love everything [Music] like the swamping Princess and the Frog this is Dagobah it's kind of a excellent yeah being held by you is quite enough to get me excited sorry sweetheart it's toxic masculinity clearly Princess Leia does not like it his head looks like a grenade because my mom's favorite character yes hmm I don't think so he would be a great asset what is that so that's the emperor but in the next movie when you see him he's completely different different actor different voice [Music] Canary thing very philosophical this movie's heavy man [Music] all right I'll give it a try no try not you or do not there is no try there it is Mama Cooper's words of wisdom it's better here he looks less like a soy boy and more like Indiana Jones which is obviously you can tell he kind of hit the gym a little bit you know tried yeah I mean look at that attempt put me to sleep too soy you are say better cook that is yes burrito.com hello what have we here welcome I'm Lando Calrissian I'm the administrator of this facility sorry am I interrupting anything not really [Laughter] we would be honored join us holy I love you [Music] holy oh [Music] You Escape don't make me destroy you no I am your father oh God [Music] that was so good that was great that was better than the first one 100 that was much better than the first one not that I didn't like the first one this one just had more going for it from the get-go I think as we got past the like establishing the world and the characters it felt like you needed to know the back story but then this was kind of like the real deal it was very cool I did not hate Luke in this one he actually had some good character development that was impressive right Leia dropped the weird accent as you pointed out and she just seemed normal she also was like more of a supporting character in this one like she was just kind of there yeah not really but like it was it was more about Luke's development I feel like she was kind of like a MacGuffin in the first one like they were looking for her they're trying to find her yeah and this was she was kind of like helping him and being a catalyst for him and you know coming back and a catalyst for Han it was like she was there to like uplift the men in a way yeah that's not good that's misogynistic internalizing yeah that is like the internalized patriarchy in George Lucas's mind Empire Strikes Back is the most patriarchal film ever made that's what you can say yes it's the patriarchy is what's my favorite movie but the music was fantastic so that's another reason why sheller probably loves it the score sorry the score that's a great score um the action scenes okay when a movie is an action movie I want lots of action and we had it in this one from Deliverance yes constantly all the time I was okay so I knew I knew the Darth Vader Luke Skywalker thing now because I've seen it but just from like memes of like the people would be like Luke I'm your father and I'd be like what's that from they're like Star Wars and I'd be like oh okay so I knew going into it but still that scene was wild I was a little turned off by Luke's performance in the like no that's not true we'll have to make my mouth that's impossible that was like honestly maybe I shouldn't say that I was disappointed because it was kind of impressive the way he contorted his face like that but that whole sequence of like going from like them fighting to like him going into the you know chamber or whatever then shooting up then going that was very cool yeah the fight's got like a three-act structure within the fight yeah it's pretty cool and I feel like he redeemed himself because everybody's thinking oh he can't do it he I mean obviously like didn't do it but he held his own so that was impressive and you like that um I don't want to see Darth Vader's face after seeing the little clip of his bed I want to know what happened but I don't really want to see it okay I feel like it's gonna be like a weird Voldemort situation and I feel like that could be very unfortunate for me to have to witness they kept I want to know why and we sort of touched on this before we were talking about it it feels like they were setting something up with Leia and Luke like they can communicate and that kind of thing well like with the force but she has not established that she like I don't know if you can do that with anybody else yeah I mean it's in this one it's a little a little hazy but it's more like he's he himself is just able to communicate using the force I wasn't sure if like they had some kind of weird special well I mean I don't want to say I don't want to say you got to see the next one okay but but that was interesting at the end I was like oh because I thought he could only do that with like people yeah so that was interesting Han Solo and Leia I that's entertaining that's a good relationship it was good I enjoyed it yes like I had the bantering it was great I'm a big fan of Chewbacca I was very sad that cb30 C3PO there you go C-3PO and R2D2 were not together for most of it I enjoy their bantering and their relationship so that was kind of sad but all in all this one was fantastic so I want to know what happens next that's good so what do you think is going to happen next I love it I was on the edge of my seat when it ended I was like oh I want it to keep going like I wanted to I would be very upset if I watched this in real time and had to wait like another three years um okay so what happened they they're gonna have to go find Han oh wait okay so we didn't get to be driving the Hut not yet okay so then we'll meet him in the next one that's the one that I think looks like a booger and I've seen pictures of him because he does he looks like he was shot out of somebody's nose I think maybe that's the movie that I've seen because I don't understand any of this but I remember there's a scene in like a an alien bar club and Jazz was like a fat gluttonous like Harvey weinsteiness kind of man no maybe that's what George Lucas was writing in base maybe he knew possibly at the time yeah um anyway he kind of reminds me of that so maybe I've seen that film I don't really remember I have no idea um so we're gonna see him because Han is like being delivered um Luke now has a hand again Darth is very upset that Luke is not there and oh we're gonna meet the emperor probably so those that's probably they're gonna do they're gonna fight the emperor so what do you think about the new characters in the movie there were kind of a a few new ones oh it's Orlando Lando appreciated that I felt like he was like a Michael jackson-esque Go-Go 70s dancer I liked the cape the outfits were fun I felt like and every time like his emotions he was like oh like Pizzazz every time that he moved like oh I can get I don't know he just gave me that Vibe anyway he's great I think he has a lot of complexity because obviously in his like he was only in the film for like a quarter of it basically yeah but he was you know taken advantage of by Darth Vader basically and like gave into that and that was going along with it realized it was wrong and then suddenly was there to support them I don't know if I fully trust him but it was like a cool very quick character Arc then I was like he's had more of an arc if this is authentic he's had more of an arc than most of the characters just in general which is kind of cool yeah short short amount of time on screen but leaves a big but yes yeah and like basically like was the I don't want to say like moving Force but like really propelled the ending of the film in a way it wouldn't have been able to be like happened without him um Yoda was cool um that whole sequence that was very weird and I was I know it needs to happen because I know that he becomes an important figure obviously in like the franchise he becomes baby Yoda again or we see whatever so obviously people care about him so it's good to see him uh and yeah my mom loves Yoda she would say do or do not there is no try all the time like I'm not kidding when I was younger if I would say oh I'm trying she was like do or do not there's no try like she hates people like I'm trying like whiners she does that probably from Yoda but I do think his head looks like the top of a grenade that was my first impression he's funny though yeah he's very funny but what I did not like was and I know that it has to be this way for like establishing the narrative I did not like how disconnected the two like plots were in that moment where he was there and they were you know flying around fixing the ship I was just kind of like get to it like I want you to be back together and like fighting and that kind of thing yeah but it made sense so it was fine it's it's kind of like Lord of the Rings which I know you haven't seen but you have the first one the Fellowship of the Ring they're all together going on to an Adventure yeah and then they they splint her off and so then the second one is very much like this where they're all separate and they're doing their their separate thing and then they come back together which is looking very good into Central thing even in literature was like the hero's journey and that sort of thing like you can't always do it together so it makes sense but in the like moment of watching it I was like okay I'm tired of seeing you like lift boxes in a handstand like we get it well plus you you just like seeing all of them together in the first one yeah and so you just won again you want to bring the game back together exactly um you mentioned a couple of times like oh that we're getting really philosophical I do think it'll be cool to see how Luke's relationship with Darth develops because I think that is the significant part of his like maturity that develops but like how he handles that yeah um obviously there were much more philosophical undertones of you know I don't know philosophical is the right word but if like patience and maturity it kind of felt like a bit of a coming-of-age kind of thing and choosing light versus darkness which are all like very quintessential like narrative tactics yeah well maybe not devices but yeah and then imagine when they weren't using crazy gender ideology and actually created something interesting yeah shocking uh but I think Yoda will be interesting obviously he becomes more important um there were lots of new Admirals but they all got killed so I don't really need to talk about those yeah Vader was just choking them all out yeah that's that's meant the emperor I think we had been he had been referenced in the first film yeah they mentioned him like once or twice but that's but then you see is looming whatever something that'll be interesting because I when he when Darth Vader comes back basically in this I was kind of confused obviously if he like kind of was blew off in the end of the first film and then the whole death starcus blown up so in my mind I was like darth's the only one left and then you got to realize oh my God this is an entire thing there's another Emperor so I kind of see like where's the emperor like how do you blow up that basically because I thought when you hit the Death Star they're all gone so I think that'll be interesting to see unfold but I'm excited good so you guys better like this video so that I can watch the third one because if not I'm not going to watch it on my own time because I don't have a TV and I don't watch movies so you have to watch it and comment so that I can no we definitely have to watch return if I've made it this far yeah I mean you have to know how it ends it's

comments section i'm brett cooper i'm not really a climate alarmist at all i love the planet i love being outside but i'm not freaking out about global warming but i do enjoy watching other people freak out about global warming you guys know that i love the protests where they go around and they glue their hands to paintings and counters and all of that stuff today we have a new kind of freakout and this one is more tailored to celebrities and social media but before we get into it make sure you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already because we are getting so close to a million and then ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode last week on july 29th the yard released a report on the celebrities that emit the most co2 emissions using their private jets i was expecting the kardashians to be at the top of the list especially kylie because there's all of those headlines and memes about how she you know uses her private jet for like a two minute flight and that kind of thing she did not even crack the top ten number one was taylor swift and then floyd mayweather what what why is floyd mayweather taking 177 private jet flights this year what is he doing maybe it's a security hazard that they're so worried that he's gonna like beat somebody up on the plane so he has to be on a private jet alex rodriguez blake sheldon i mean he is trying to get up doesn't he live in alaska he's probably trying to fly up there maybe steven spielberg there we go kim kardashian so we did have a kardashian on the list mark wahlberg oprah winfrey that's unsurprising and then travis scott so i guess we have two kardashian adjacent ish people on there that's a list but people were most concerned with taylor swift because as of last week she had taken 170 trips on her private jet which is not the most in trip number out of everybody but she had the largest flight time i think she had accrued like 20 days on her private jet and we're only on day 2 17 of this year and she's already flown 170 days out of the year [Music] that's just a bit like where are you going she's not even on tour maybe she's very scared of monkey box i don't know the girl's insane the internet could not cope and the swifties were very divided because you guys know taylor swift is very political she's an activist she's very left-leaning she wants everybody to be happy she wants the planet to be okay and some people love that about her she hates marsha blackburn i don't even know why she still lives in tennessee if she hates our politics so much but anyway people freaked out like somebody said taylor swift taking 170 private jet flights this year where the actual flight does she need to go that badly to fast-track destroying the planet somebody else said washing my silly little reusable straws while taylor swift takes her private jet to the grocery store which is so accurate everybody walks around thinking that we're all saving the planet by sipping out of gross biodegradable paper straws when the celebrities are just flying around willy-nilly on their jets i'm not saying that they shouldn't because i don't care but it's just a bit ridiculous that people think that they're actually doing anything for someone who sings about driving trains bus stops and cars so much turns out taylor swift prefers to use her private jet for what would be a two-hour car ride didn't grow up on a mansion my ass i can't believe she tried to convince her fans that she's an activist that's the other thing about taylor swift she has all of these songs where she's like i wasn't the rich girl i didn't grow up in a manchester whatever and then it came out that her childhood home was like huge and beautiful and of course she became famous at like 15 so a lot of people were calling bs on that that's right you're a big fat photo then her team obviously had to come out smooth things over and they very quickly made a comment and said no no no no all those trips are not tailors she is actually just such a good person that she lets other people use her jet when she's not flying on it so really she can't be blamed for all of this there's really no way to validate that they didn't give any facts and figures so we're just going by whatever her pr team is saying but people were commenting on that as well somebody said you've really gotta hand it to taylor swift's publicist because she quote generously rents out her jet to her poor friends who can't afford their own personal jets to use as the funniest possible way to put a humanitarian spin on her carbon emissions obviously that did not convince anyone even if she was loaning it out like it's just still a bit ridiculous how hard they're flailing so instead because people were not convinced they just started making memes about her jet we were all roasting kylie jenner for her 15-minute flight while taylor swift was out here flying her jet almost every day like she wants to compete with birds or something this was taylor swift when they banned private jets um literally taylor swift going to italy in her private jet to get tomato sauce because she ran out of it it's so ridiculous i do appreciate the fact that all these memes are happening and that the whole swifty nation is just kind of combusting not because i don't like her like i definitely listen to her music and i did growing up but it is such like a cult fandom that i just enjoy the chaos maybe that's a bad thing but i like chaos and it gives me good things to talk about and it makes me happy so i'm not really mad about any of this someone else said my favorite thing about this private jet thing is people conceding that they know celebrities can't fly commercial but like not me i would like taylor swift to fly southwest airlines being fully serious this tweet i mean it sparked a whole debate in the comments about like celebrity safety and a lot of people were saying like she's been attacked before she you know has armed security all of that she can't and you know that is all totally valid and that's why if you feel more comfortable if you're a celebrity taking a private jet that's your prerogative if you can pay for it go for it taylor swift listen if you need to go to italy to get pasta i hope it's delicious also for my own benefit and the rest of you know us plebes in the world if a celebrity was trying to you know fly commercial yeah hey i mean if they want to fly first class and have their whole entourage and security sitting around them go for it that's fine but it causes insanity at the airport like can you imagine if you got on a plane and taylor swift was just sitting there in the front row people would lose their damn mind we wouldn't get off the ground for hours because everybody would be freaking out so if you are saving me stress at the airport by flying a private jet that's okay that's just my two cents about the whole thing the point is people were still pissed they don't care about her pr they don't care about all of these arguments about the other celebrities taking private jets they're just angry at taylor so much so the twitter made this article and this thread trend at the top of the app yesterday and it has her picture on it it says while celebrities cut ba uh cutting out supposed to be cutting back they were so rushed to get this article out that they did not even proofread it while celebrities cutting back on private jets would be a welcome change for the earth actually combating global warming will require deeper policy changes like the propaganda is blatant all of these climate warriors started to turn against an activist icon which probably scared everybody straight because that means that once everybody else realizes that they also have private jets they also have you know five unsustainable homes on the water even though they're all claiming that the water is rising save me the bs barack obama i know it was your birthday yesterday so happy belated birthday but don't talk to me about climate change i know that you have your little beachfront martha's vineyard house if you're so concerned about the water rising maybe you should move to a mountain so instead they do this and they flip the narrative saying that personal behavior isn't the problem instead we need big government change we need to spend lots of money and we all need to drive electric cars and do everything except change personal behavior they literally said that we need systemic change i hate the word systemic it's such [\u00a0__\u00a0] now you just want your hypocritical behavior to be excused and overlooked so you can keep virtue signaling and spending our tax dollars without everybody realizing that you are doing exactly what you preach against this is so much bigger than a discussion about the environment just be a good person clean up your trash don't leave trash on the beach and stop giving me paper straws

it's it's hurting my brain seeing how much she looks like ben shapiro it's weird welcome back to the comment section i'm bread cooper guys we're doing something a little different today do you guys know who hassan is the need to humiliate people sometimes you need to make an example out of them he's uh chank uger's nephew and chankyuger is the man who owns and runs young turks hassan got his start doing young turks stuff now he is a really big twitch streamer and for those of you who don't know about young turks it has a huge reach it's uber successful and then likewise hassan is the number one political streamer on twitch so good heavy hitters here i had heard of hassan before but i never watched a single one of his videos so i really had no idea who this guy was but apparently i triggered him and he made a whole video about me it was uh it was part of one of his lives and he posted it on youtube it's called feminized ben shapiro classic my friend anyway i'm gonna do a response to it and watch it with you guys i picked out some of my favorite moments but if you wanna watch the whole video i'm going to link it in the description you can go see it before we get into it make sure that you like this video that you are subscribed to this channel and that you click that little bell so that you never miss a comment section episode let's talk about brenda shapiro who's doing these like youtube shorts apparently this is part of the daily wire i was made aware of this by uh no samson carter on on twitter they were talking about this earlier today and i am in awe shocked they literally this is they watched my youtube channel and straight up we're just like this is what we're gonna do and they basically set a fake streaming operation cadence wise is the exact same so let's take a look at what this commentary is about to start off his first criticism of me was that this show is too corporate he talks about how it's produced by daily wire which is true everybody knows that i love when they they have like a fake room too they like they created like a in a studio they were like this is what a zoomer room looks like and then she's got like one leg up and i it this is so bad what happened to me right dude this is the most like brand you can get industry plant streamer she's not even streaming she doesn't she's not streaming these aren't from her streams she might actually stream at certain points but it'll no matter what she does it's going to be all brand okay it's so corporate way later oh my god dude oh my god acknowledge that you have a fake set you  weirdo okay yeah it's it's branded i don't know what to tell you also are you offended that i'm in a studio yeah it's a set and we sort of designed it to my liking and it's all pretty personalized so i don't really know what the problem is and yeah i'm not a streamer i have a youtube channel i do stream sometimes but most of my stuff is you know you see my memes they're edited so yeah i'm not a streamer these are deliberate choices that they're making to like present themselves as a brand and i do think that this makes it and i was right by the way it is a studio it's not real like why is there a snowboard on the wall man what's going on you know why jesus like this is my professional studio in my house right and you can it's still my living room you know he's not a real room as i called i love the fact that he felt like it was a gotcha to find out that this was not a real room i've never hidden that like i post on my story like behind the scenes stuff all the time i have an entire post where i talked about the creation of the set and why i have a snowboard it's because i was a competitive snowboarder in college and so i wanted a snowboard because i actually have one that hangs in my house but no i've never hidden that it was a set you literally just saw the video where i was showing all of this dude it's so wild to just like sit in a studio and try to recreate recreate like a streamer uh setup also i don't think that there is necessarily anything bad or delegitimatizing about doing something professionally or in a studio and i mean correct me if i'm wrong but i feel like if you know streamers and youtubers had the budget and the resources to be able to be in like a controlled environment with a whole set i mean you just said that you were you know chopping off a corner of your living room to have your professional studio if you have the resources to be able to have that i feel like it makes life a lot easier and it allows you to you know focus on your work and your commentary so i'm grateful for it and i've never hidden it if there's one thing that young people are very good at spotting it's fake corporate garbo okay this this person is so deliberate this isn't live this is not uh done in an authentic way no matter how psychotic you are or no matter how much of a pathetic little incel simp you are and think like oh woman saying my opinions on the internet i like i will watch everything no matter how deep in that cut you are it is going to be too fake it's multiple angles you know what i mean multiple angles for cameras uh well lit you know what i mean there's no it's not authentic and people will spot that statistically speaking the largest segment of my audience is 18 to 24 and then the audience is also split 50 50 male and female so it's not like i just have a bunch of like 18 year old boys that are like oh my god conservative girl speaking i think the numbers speak for themselves and that i have a pretty broad reach she's never gonna have a america deserve 9 11 moment you know what i mean america deserve 9 11 dude it i'm saying that like we we've totally brought it on ourselves dude holy sh if you think that you know having a america deserved 9 11 moment or something like that gives you street cred that's cool you do you i will respectfully disagree it's probably not something that i'm gonna say i try to think before i speak but you know you do you man it's clearly worked so props to that he's not gonna have uh real moments of pure outrage because all of the pure outrage that you see on this is created beforehand written beforehand the reactions are not genuine and therefore people can recognize it i put this show together i pick my segments i have you know veto power over anything it's structured around what i choose so this isn't some like corporate top down like brett you need to talk about this and talk this way when we're presenting you with a script and react to this no it's genuinely the stuff that i'm interested in and i mean i don't know if anybody else knows this about just the daily wire in general but every host here we all write our own material the reason why people like me you guys are in here i'm sure you're aware this is because i'm i'm real this is what i believe in i sometimes should hold myself back but i can't hold myself back some people like that a lot of people like that a lot of people see it as authentic and then some people some people grow to despise it okay also somewhere in like that little segment of him talking about it being too corporate i'll try to find the clip he was like look at her wearing those like white beats headphones trying to be a streamer so her wearing white beats by dre uh feels like a deliberate how do you do fellow kids aesthetic choice which has been a whole debacle like i have people in my audience in my comment section that are saying like brett you need to get better headphones like the beats ones they're so cliche like it's choogie or whatever i know and that honestly just makes me want to wear them more i personally like them my producer who's sitting across from me tells me that they're stupid and i need better headphones guys i like them and i'm keeping them also do you see how dark my hair is if i put on black headphones i would look like like a helmet head [Music] the next thing that hassan decided to hit me on uh he watched a couple of my shorts where i was talking about weirdo teachers talking to children about sex and gender ideology and he kind of has a weird hill to die on like that was the one thing that he picked out of the very small amount of my videos that he watched first up we have sex assigned at birth this is what the doctor says you are when you come out of the womb next up we have jack why do people get so mad at this like what what is the i mean why i know that like your immediate reaction when you see this is like what the like why are children learning about this but it's like why not i mean what is the problem with learning about this i mean i haven't seen the full thing i haven't seen the full thing but if it's like just literally if it's literally like teaching kids gender who cares what's the problem it has nothing to do with sex bro you're being a little bit groomery to be honest if you finish the video yes they're talking about gender identity they're talking about gender expression underneath that on that paper which you get to in the video and he tactfully does not talk about they talk about your attraction like who you're attracted to whatever is that not weird that a teacher is asking to like know what a ten-year-old is attracted to like across the board can we say that that is like a little bit creepy look the normative position is heteronormative i get it okay you're a cishet your entire life you're like you've been educated a certain way your sexuality and your sex is deeply associated with the way you view yourself and the way you view the world it's your truth yada yada yada whenever anybody says like some circular argument they always end it with like my truth my truth trademark and there's no such thing as my truth there is the truth there's the objective truth you can have subjective feelings doesn't make it a universal truth my dude and you might even go so far as to say well that's weird and creepy and perverted they're talking about sex sexy time and it's like well they're in fifth grade that but but like they're not you're the one who added sexy time into that okay you're the one who's weird if your immediate reaction to like someone learning about gender is sex it's not examine why you feel the way that you do and ask yourself like why am i immediately thinking that they're like why am i thinking butt sex when i think when i see a queer person existing on the planet we're talking about weird teachers doing strange assignments talking about attraction in children and this is just a classic sjw tactic that if somebody on the other side of the political aisle points out something that's weird we're like hey that's odd that's creepy they immediately turn on us and are saying the fact that you notice that and you're pointing out that that makes you perverted that makes you racist or whatever but then they turn around and start adamantly defending it so which one is weirder the one that points it out and says hey this is weird or the one that now is gonna die on this hill of grooming and like they're like oh you're a groomer it's like dude what the is wrong with you what is wrong with you what this is no different than being like when a man and a woman love one another you know uh they they can have a child like it's just that's it that's like literally the thing a man and a woman loves each other they date and then they get married just like your mommy and daddy no one on the planet looks at that and goes that up that is absolutely up why is that happening no one would ever say that what's up with conservatives they want everyone to be ace is that what it is like nope nope ace representation only brother i'm sorry you are triggering me right now get the out of here do you understand like the fact that any time if you look at this video when he tries to mimic a conservative he like puts on like a hick alabama southern accent i can't believe the disgusting breeder system teacher of mine is pregnant how gross how gross of her to be pregnant at school that's what you sound like we're not saying that you can't you know have a picture of your spouse you can't talk about that we're talking about curriculum that video with her little page that is a part of a curriculum there is significantly worse and actual grooming happening in so many other parts of american culture starting with child beauty pageants abolish that father what's up so you obviously have not seen that in multiple videos and in multiple live streams i have talked extensively about how sexualizing any children is freaking creepy you guys know the whole like dance moms culture like the competitive dance stuff i also think that that stuff is creepy like eight-year-old girls in like sparkly little bikinis gyrating and like twerking across the stage that also is weird i literally tweeted last week about how this like insurgence of parents sexualizing children is freaking insane and i think it personally started you brought up a good point with the beauty pageants i said that i felt like it really went downhill with dance moms and i've talked about how i was a dancer growing up but my mom refused to allow me to do competitive dance because it was a bunch of like 10 year olds in sparkly bras twerking on stage it is it's freaking creepy so i do want to like find that common ground with you so i am not saying that it's just lgbtq plus people trying to you know indoctrinate and groom people into any ideology or whatever across the board like let kids be kids and the parental rights and education bill all of that it covers like a straight ideology as well it is saying do not talk about gender ideology and sexual ideology to children i really don't see how that is a bad thing i said bro why is feminism straight biting my aesthetic she doesn't even have a real life audience to give her mental illness in real time this is what i said this is what the chatter was upset about by the way has anyone else seen this extraordinary daily wire commentary youtuber channel started in march and already has 315k subs lol and they basically set a fake streaming operation cadence-wise is the exact same you know they go find this content themselves searching lgbt school and tick tock oh for sure i'm just saying that like it's wild that this is now this is what they're doing now and like you said i'm not even streaming and i've never been told that we have the same cadence people do say that ben and i have the same cadence as well as you know looking alike but that's a new one obviously like content-wise bar for bar flow they stole my flow this stuff you know what i mean as we move on you're going to start seeing that hassan likes to think of himself as the creator of online casual political commentary that he has paved his own way if you will i paved it on my own what is this the right is actively trying to recreate you that speaks to how effective you are oh yeah i mean we've talked about this before like tp usa presentation notes literally have me as a content inspiration for twitch streaming so you know that's not this is not in my like mind i did not make this up you know what i mean this is something that this is something that like the right openly is trying to recreate which is very weird when you think about it but yeah outside creators knelt boys logan paul hassan abbey daily wire memes daily wires literally listed there hassanabe daily wire memes you and me bro we're both in spos for tpusa now i said this before but one thing that i have noticed in my now couple of days of watching hassan's videos is that he likes to take credit for things just like he took credit for the success of my show but one thing that he sort of glazes over is that he got a start at young turks his uncle jankuger owns young turks my uncle at the time had a little youtube channel slash network called the young turks network i was like i'll go intern there and then suddenly this intern was running the advertising department and had his own show i was the first person to join on and like take charge of the advertising sales and operations i i just made my own choices and uh built my own business model i guess if i were to use a term like that i paved it on my own so in the end he really is just trying to you know take credit for everything and find ways to diminish the success of somebody else you weren't the first one to do it and bro your uncle owns the young turks like we know how you got your start so anyway that's about all uh hassan thank you so much for taking the time out of your very busy day clearly to highlight my show and things about me uh there were parts of it that i didn't show on here so if you want to see his whole video like i said i'm linking it in the description i am undeterred and i'm gonna keep making these videos and i'm going to keep wearing my white beats headphones nobody can stop me and i'm not changing the set hey guys we're adding new comment section content every day so make sure you like subscribe and ring that bell so you don't miss a single video", "qRT_6O6BeEo": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper so there is a music festival going on right now in Austin it's called Austin City Limits I've actually always wanted to go but I've never been able to it always happens over my birthday week my birthday is tomorrow coincidentally I am always out of town or working or have commitments on my birthday that are not like fun things like I'm always gone and so as a result I've never been able to like really plan ahead far enough to get to Austin City Limits one day though I will get there that was just an anecdotal aside that I felt like was important to add to this for no reason whatsoever thank you for telling me that awesome City Limits is going on right now and Country alternative Mega Superstar Casey Musgraves is performing and she took her time on stage as an opportunity to bash Ted Cruz because apparently she's never had an original thought but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection this is the video that started going viral this person tweeted it first and said you can tell at Casey Musgraves is a real Texan by the volume of her hair and how much she hates Ted Cruz we're gonna get into that in a second but here's the video who kills the open up Ted Cruz [Applause] okay so that's basically it but I wanted to give you a taste of the song as well it's called high horse it's basically about like an arrogant narcissist who you know kills the buzz in the party only thinks about himself whatever I'm sure we all know a few of those I would not really put Ted Cruz in that bucket but Texas liberals love to hate on him and you know what she did get a good audience response but the majority of people who go to Austin City Limits are not Texas people and also it is in Austin which is the liberal Cesspool of Texas so obviously she's going to get Applause she also took the time out of her set to do some pro-abortion activism I don't have a video of it but this is the quote she said the Supreme Court honestly we're in a weird time but we've got each other there is a light I promise that was just simply profound and people were losing it under her trending page I woke up to see her trending this morning like USA singers which is a super Lefty like music band type thing I don't know said Casey Musgraves calling out Ted Cruz on his home turf is the kind of activism we need hashtag turn Texas blue horrifying occupied Democrats per usual jumping in here with a cringe tweet breaking country music Superstar Casey Musgraves beautifully trolls Senator Ted Cruz during a concert in Austin by changing the lyrics of her song to say that Ted Cruz always kills the buzz whenever he opens his mouth retweet if you're a Casey fan now they need like a new tweet format is all I'm saying another person said Casey Musgraves just called to Ted Cruz yeah and there were a bunch of tweets similar to that like oh my God I love this whatever this Republican author also jumped in and I just had to read it to you guys because it's just like quintessential Boomer GOP this guy who has alpha male in his name says I've never heard of Casey Musgraves before she attacked Ted Cruz yesterday she strikes me as a desperate b-lister that will say anything to get validation for the woke left I prefer to spend my valuable time listening to music from artists with actual talent like Kid Rock like bro I get what you're trying to do I appreciate it but just like I don't think cultural commentary is your Forte you're an author stick with that I think it'll be great listen I don't love Casey Musgraves politics but I will happily admit that she is wildly talented and wildly successful like obviously she's trying to get validation but she is very much a list I still listen to her music I love it it's a good time whatever but this is just a normal GOP response but I did look at some of the comments under these very virtue signaling posts to people being like Oh my God I love her like look at this video especially that first one like one person said LOL yeah they hate him so much they keep electing him only California transplants and brain dead white liberal women would vote for Democrat clowns like I mean as it stands right now Texas is still red and it's a little purple but you know what it's still red and these people are so locked in their little like liberal Austin bubble they're like oh everybody around us agrees like we every we're all gonna turn Texas blue it's like guys not yet like I get what you're trying to do but Austin is not the entirety of Texas thank you very much another person said she's as fake as her face she can kick rocks which you guys all know one of my favorite lines I will say though Casey Musgraves is attractive she is a pretty lady I don't know if she's had plastic surgery or not maybe she just has great skin care I mean if she wanted to look even better if she could start using nimi skincare as you all know by now nimi skincare is my very favorite skin care brand they are 100 made right here in the United States that they even Source some of their ingredients from local American Farms which I absolutely love I've been using their products since January and they have completely transformed my skin like I swear by these products they have multiple different bundles and routines to fit your needs I personally use the daily glow up routine I absolutely love it if you want to try them out go to nimiskincare.com use promo code Cooper at checkout for 15 off your order again that is nimiskincare.com promo code Cooper because I don't care what anybody says everybody deserves to have beautiful skin even somebody who says this ridiculous things as this on stage somebody else said then why do the real Texans keep voting him back in somebody said stunning and brave Shilling for her handlers hahaha oh yeah she has to hit her activism quota for the month I'm sure this person said she is so brave I know when I go to a music festival my only hope is that someone will stop playing music and talk politics just in case the crowd was coalescing around one particular artist or song a well-timed political statement gets everybody back in their Corner hashtag buzzkill like yeah she's the real buzz kill here like girl just sing your song that's why everybody came and that really is basically my attitude like I know that most mainstream musicians and artists are left wing but because I appreciate what they put out into the world artistically I will often try to separate their art from the musician and enjoy it because it is objectively good if you want to do activism on social media if you want to start a foundation in organization whatever do it that's your prerogative go forth but it seems incredibly disrespectful on either side of the political aisle to turn a concert that your fans have paid for have traveled to attend in just like a quick political grab like you don't know your audience's demographic background or story they're here to hear you sing and have like an incredible probably emotional experience that is all and I would say that for a right-wing artist too like there is a reason why everybody loves Morgan Wallen and Carrie Underwood and even Jason Aldean even though his family is very political because they show up and they perform they do their job they crush it and then they leave the activism in any political comments that they might do for later and on the side like don't make people excluded you're not changing any Minds by bashing Ted Cruz on the stage that's a cheap shot and you're just making yourself look ridiculous hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "2m9qf8IMVIE": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper you know i think i chose to talk about ezra miller at the perfect time because i had held off for a bit because i wanted to see if he would do anything crazy because it felt like every day that i opened twitter he had left us like a little nugget of crime and it was always the most random thing like ezra throws chair in hawaii and then suddenly he's in vermont stealing alcohol oh he's in iceland with a sex cult some obviously are much worse than others but truly it just felt kind of psychotic because i think he is warner brothers is obviously very concerned about his new movie the flash and they're trying to figure out what to do because it was 200 million dollars to make now they have a man that is a criminal on the run a possible sex offender who was starring in it so they gave a few options of how to resolve this issue so i made an episode kind of debriefing on ezra and now we have updates i mean seriously this kind of fell into my lap and i'm so excited about it because this just gets more and more exciting every single day but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode and in case you forgot i have merch now which i am so excited about and i have been so appreciative of all of the love and all of the orders i cannot wait to see all of you wearing the cool shirts and the sweatshirts this is only our first capsule there will be more to come if you want to check it out go to dailywire.com brett i hope you all like it i hope ezra miller does not like it that would be like the worst thing of the century imagine ezra miller repping your brand like obviously warner brothers is freaked out but anyway to the meat of the story ezra is finally speaking out a variety got the exclusive here's the article it says the flash star ezra miller seeking treatment for complex mental health issues exclusive here's a picture of him they chose a very mild happy clean-cut image because if you have been following the story you know that these days ezra looks like some kind of deranged sociopath crackhead something like you look at the pictures and you're like oh i feel invaded in a certain sort of way this is his quote when he broke his silence after being on the run from the police he said having recently gone through a time of intense crisis i now understand that i am suffering complex mental health issues and have begun ongoing treatment i want to apologize to everyone i have alarmed and upset with my past behavior i am committed to doing the necessary work to get back to a health and safe and productive stage in my life what who thought that this statement was a good idea that we were all gonna go oh yeah great yep you oh i'm so sorry yep you just had a few oopsies no you did not have a few oopsies you groomed a 12 year old girl until she was 18 and you have a restraining order against you you apparently have a sex cult in iceland that is not a time of intense crisis for you probably for the people that you were grooming but for you that was a time of intense creepiness and criminal activity there is no other way to put that get that son of a off the field right now out he's fired this line i want to apologize to everyone that i have alarmed and upset with my past behavior dude this wasn't 10 years ago it was literally last week that you were arrested with a woman and her children in your drug-infested vermont house on my past behavior five days ago i mean this is classic hollywood i said this in the last episode i'm gonna say it now they will do anything to make a buck they are freaking out about the optics of ezra they don't want to lose 200 million dollars so they put together they packaged this happy little pr breaking the silence statement they're probably gonna put him in rehab get him drugged up enough so that he can go sit on jimmy fallon's show and give a little fluffy interview which is why it's been so tough to see you go through all this thank you it's uh it's been tough with everything's um everything's been going on with my life they're expecting that audiences are going to see this quote and go oh wow this criminal wow that's okay we'll we'll go see the movie anyway like no you are defending and propping up a man who has been accused and charged of serious criminal activity i'm not going to fall for it i don't care how many pr stunts you do to try to make him look like the freaking easter bunny i don't care they'll see they'll see and they'll know and they'll say why she wouldn't even harm a fly i saw a couple of tweets where people were going like this is so great like he's gonna be great in therapy i can't wait to see the flash i bet it was all just a misunderstanding grooming children a misunderstanding no people get your heads out of your ass like we live in this culture now where kids going to drag shows teachers grooming people pediatricians going yeah let's give a 14 year old girl a hysterectomy people are so numb to it now a man who is accused of grooming is in therapy and they're like oh great we fixed the situation no we have not this is a much broader issue thankfully there were not as many of those tweets most people were going the hell like this person said past behavior it was happening until 20 seconds ago that's something from the good place which is a fantastic show another guy said please don't tell me we're going to forgive him faster than we did will smith honestly i'm kind of let down that we did not see a video of ezra giving that little statement probably because he didn't write the statement himself it was done by his pr team i'm guessing who are frantically trying to fix their situation but i would have loved to see him in like a dark room basically tied to a chair being like ezra say you're sorry hey guys i'm good i made it through you can untie me now i would watch that i would pay for that that's the content i want another person said he deserves jail time he groomed and kidnapped a teenager why are y'all just conveniently forgetting that because it's hollywood and they don't care and they want to sweep it under the rug that their shiny new star groomed and kidnapped a native american girl at the age of 12. i'm not gonna stop repeating that because it's serious somebody else said um that's cool and all but you committed some actual crimes and those are still gonna need to be addressed yeah exactly i'm not upset that he's seeking help if this is actually true he should be in therapy he should be in some sort of rehab facility he should get the help that he actually needs so that he can be some sort of productive human in society not doing harm to others just saying you're going to therapy does not excuse everything you've done in the past you still have to take accountability for that and that's just a broader problem that we have in our society another person said ezra miller's apology be like the deep it wasn't on purpose that's from the boys that's a really good callback literally him honestly like 50 of the memes and the gifts that people are posting about ezra are the deep from the boys like they're pulling from so many different episodes it's kind of spot-on maybe he watched that show and he was like this is my inspiration that's right next stop the atlantic ocean that's right that's right somebody else said here comes the apology tour so the studio can release the flash literally i mean you'll remember last week in that episode where i talked about warner brothers three options to move forward with the flash to recap they are one ezra gives an interview explaining his erratic behavior and does limited press i'm also not going to call him there he's apparently non-binary goes by they them i don't really care you're a criminal i'm not going to feed into your number two ezra miller plays no part in the film's promotion and the role gets recast and number three the film gets completely scrapped and this is from warner brothers themselves apparently they are going with number one which seems like the worst possible choice for everybody except their wallets except i don't know if it's actually gonna be good for their wallets because at this rate who's going to go see that movie somebody retweeted it and said number one i hope they're actually getting help this is good like yes the man obviously needs help he also needs to be in jail for a time number two this is the beginning of a massive pr campaign to try and save the image of the flash film we will see how convinced everyone is in six months we can start the clock right now we will come back when the flash is released and see what the response is imagine if in six months nobody is talking about the fact that he groomed a girl and he's doing you know fill your guts or spill your guts with james corden happily and everybody's going oh ezra everybody's hugging him like they were all hugging harvey weinstein oh he's done nothing wrong like they did it with harvey until the very end they can do it with ezra which is disgusting but it's possible because those pr people they are the best in the entire world the hollywood pr people they know how to clean up a mess you know what you have to do mate clear the board start again the last meme one of my favorites somebody sits the little cat sorry for multiple counts of abuse assault grooming theft death threats and starting a cult it will happen again it will happen again i don't think ezra is stopping anytime soon they might be able to put the little lid on him for the time being so they can get the film out but this man obviously has issues this man is not going to resolve his issues by doing a couple of weeks of talk therapy and then going on late night shows so that his film can be released what this man actually needs is a court-appointed criminal psychiatrist in prison like that's what needs to happen not all this fluffy rehab talk therapy sir your issues go a lot deeper than that hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "Wyk9NcYobeI": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I think we all know that journalism is basically dead like when Elon had just published the Twitter Files about the suppression of the hunter Biden's story and the censorship during the 2020 election and what Twitter had to do with all of that you know what the New York Times is writing about whether you should buy Crocs for your boyfriend like that was their biggest issue and we're back today with another example of this just truly exemplary journalism that we have in 2022 but before we get into the story I just want to say thank you all for 1.5 million subscribers we hit a million so fast over the summer I think the show launched March 1st of 2022 so maybe we can hit 2 million by the one year anniversary of the show premiering we'll see but thank you guys so much I appreciate you being here with me every single day I am honored that

content weekly live streams with me and I might have some very cool content coming in the new year for you back to just incredible journalism that is why you subscribe to daily wire and not Washington Post because Washington Post was talking about the most pressing issue of our time the overrepresentation of white men named Mike literally this is something that they wrote here we go researchers say researchers say the discoveries programming overwhelmingly featured white men as experts while emphasizing negative messages about sharks during Shark Week Shark Week lacks diversity over represents men named Mike scientists say so not only do we have a problem with serious journalism we also have a problem with the science trademark I mean we've known that for a while now especially since fauci burst onto the scene again with copa19 all of this is just ridiculous what scientist is doing research on white men in Shark Week bird I don't understand why these people have a desperate need to ruin everything like not everything in the world is fodder for your terrible political analyzes and your desperate attempts to make everything problematic like definitely not shark week just let the people sit on their couches and enjoy the 40th year of Shark Week I think we're almost at 40 years I don't even know it's been going on forever you do not need to use it for some weird Progressive brownie Point operation you have going on somebody replied to that article and said glad you folks are on top of what really matters oh they always are Washington Post bought out by Jeff Bezos and Amazon they really are not pushing propaganda at all somebody else said and don't get me started on the overrepresentation of great white sharks why are only white sharks called great really important questions honestly obviously that's a joke but you know what in 2022 I would not be surprised if they did that as their second installment of this article somebody else said the great white shark is also vastly overrepresented among shark species where are the brown sharks and the other sharks of color somebody replied to that and said I heard a lot more Asian shirts qualified for the show but that the producers held them out because of quotas or even looking into this Washington Post that's great that's very realistic let's actually read the article because sometimes you'll see these headlines and everybody gets upset about it and then you actually go into the article and it's just a click bait and they know that people were just gonna get pissed off and then they use it as like a look at all those stupid right Wingers getting upset no so let's actually read the article together because it actually is as ridiculous as the headline makes it seem it's a woman named Lisa whitenack has she ever thought about the racism in her own name anyway she loved sharks as a kid she spent rainy days leafing through a guide to sharks and Readers Digest every summer she would watch Shark Week discovery's annual TV event that spotlights the ocean Predator with seven days of dedicated programming but when scientists appeared on her TV screen she rarely saw any women she could look up to why would I know I could do that white neck said I didn't come from a family of scientists I didn't see very many people that looked like me on television why do you need to see people that look like you on your freaking TV screen to empower you I don't think I've ever actually asked that question maybe I'm just too distanced from this issue because I didn't have television growing up and I just didn't think about that but I would read books about incredible female explorers and you know adventurers and I didn't think that I couldn't do that because I didn't see a little brunette girl with bangs and a page boy haircut doing the exact same thing I honestly think it just comes back to Parenting like your parents should be encouraging you you shouldn't need to be relying on television to tell you that you can do something I don't know that's a whole other ordeal anyway bigger one white Knack is now a biology professor at algony College in Meadville don't come at me if that's the incorrect pronunciation anyway she found her way into shark research anyway look guys she did it even without representation in Shark Week when the pandemic lockdowns came in 2020 she saw an opportunity to study the source of her old misconceptions with Shark Week feeding audiences the wrong messages about sharks and who studies them truly like the most serious issues our society is facing at this moment in time like I get we were all locked in our homes during covid lockdowns and you're probably stressed and you're anxious like go take a walk and clear your mind like the rest of us you don't need to do this ridiculous study actually if you guys want to clear your mind you should try out magic mind so guys I've talked about this before but covering these kinds of topics and some that are even crazier than this just doing the comment section in general it can often be overwhelming and it can make me a bit anxious I'm already kind of an anxious person just because the state of the world is absolutely wild and sometimes you know drinking caffeine drinking coffee it just makes that worse and I get super jittery that is why I have loved using magic mind magic mind is the world's first productivity shot it combats procrastination brain fog fatigue and anxiety magic mind sent me a bunch of their products couple of months ago and I've been using them since then and I have absolutely noticed and in the morning I am less jittery when I take magic mind instead of coffee I have more energy and I have more clarity and focus throughout the day magic mind has a ton of incredible ingredients that make it so effective but I really credit ashwagandha and rhodiola rosea for what I'm experiencing in addition to those these drinks also include lion's mane and cordyceps

clarity more focus more level-headedness as we cover all of these insane stories together okay so back to what this ridiculous scientist was saying white Knack led a team of researchers to examine hundreds of Shark Week episodes that aired between 1988 and 2020 in a study published last month by the public library of science their research claims that discoveries programming emphasize eyes negative messages about sharks lacked useful messaging about shark conservation and overwhelmingly featured white men as experts including several with the same name the programming featured more white experts and commentators named Mike than women said David schiffman a conservationist at Arizona State University who was a co-author of the study now my dad's name is Mike and there was a joke when I was growing up because so many of my friends fathers were also named Mike I don't know what was going on between you know the late 1950s and probably 1970 with everybody naming their son Mike but this this seems like the most realistic part of this study and the most non-biased Parts you can go through and see the names of all of these shark experts the other stuff emphasizing negative messages and lacked useful messaging that's quite subjective that's you trying to find something that's bad about Shark Week to fit your agenda in my opinion my very biased opinion when there are hundreds of people of color interested who work in this field and when my field is more than half women maybe it's not an accident anymore that they are only featuring white men said shiffman so like my first thought what about Shaq are we forgetting that Shaq hosted Shark Week obviously this is not a shark expert but they're saying that this is a totally whitewashed thing I remember in 2018 everybody was talking about Shrek Swimming with Sharks I literally pulled this up just because it was so funny look at him swimming the fact that he's also probably like bigger than all of these sharks is hysterical to me [Music] sure tried to kill me the thing that is funniest to me is that this stupid video this stupid show of people just swimming with sharks shark encounter shocked with marine biologists this is what is problematic we have fallen so far they have found issues with every other TV show they have found issues with every other fast set of society now they're like you know what time for Shark Week this is it this unproblematic yearly TV show of people just swimming around and talking about sharks that it's not even the most riveting thing I mean I've watched shark week but like it's just it's ridiculous it's stupid what's gonna be next they're gonna go after those reality TV shows of like the oil drillers in Alaska you're gonna find some problematic thing there because they're all white and have huge beards I don't freaking know probably did that about Duck Dynasty I'm sure just saying this feels like a surface level issue but they get into more of the race stuff over here like listen to this Carly Bohannon a marine biologist and the co-founder of minorities in shark Sciences I don't even know how that is a real organization like they're just pulling things out of their ass they praised the study for putting numbers to her and her colleagues long-standing concerns about diversity in both the media and shark science when Bohannon founded her organization with three other black scientists in 2020 it was the first time any of them had met any other black women in their field somebody replied to one of the posts about this article and said I'm not understanding their point are they implying that if there were more diversity in the experts that there would be more positive messages about the Sharks yes probably because white people just ruin everything they go on and they say Shark Week further concentrates power in the form of publicity and media attention in the hands of white male featured scientists exasperating academic power imbalances what how was this published also the person who wrote this and pitched this to Washington Post and got it I just admire you I mean maybe not because Washington Post has like stooped low before but the fact that this made it onto the air is just wild to me onto the website whatever anyway they wrapped up the article by saying in the latest study white Knack and other researchers also found that more Shark Week episodes included stories of attacks and other fear-mongering messaging then positive language describing sharks is awe-inspiring or ecologically important which the study called a missed opportunity this is actually something The Washington Post has covered before this was in 2013. the article reads shark's reputation as man-eaters is unfair and threatens the species authors say the study offers a simple solution stop using quote shark attack as a knee-jerk term for every encounter stop describing animals that rarely kill humans as man eaters and stop demonizing them with human motives with names such as Rogue shark as if it shares traits with serial killers it's all psychological you yell Barracuda devices huh why you yelled shark we've got a panic on our hands on the 4th of July shark sightings should be called just that the city argues a brush bump or surfboard bite or close call is a shark encounter a bite that results in injury should be identified as a shark bite and a bite that leads to death should be called a fatal shark bite now I do not care if any any animal brushes up on me in the water when I'm surfing when I'm in a boat I will lose my damn mind so no that is not just my perception of sharks created by aggressive portrayals in shark weeks I just do not want any of that but they go on and they say plenty of reports are labeled shark attacks but they happen so fast that the victims and witnesses can rarely identify the kind of shark and there's a whole universe where nothing happens Neff said we see sightings and the shark swims away there's a small bite on a kayak and the shark swims away but reporters and scientists call every encounter and attack if you're a hammer everything looks like a nail I love that in both of those scenarios they just throw in a little bite like it might not have like bitten you but oh just a little bite on a surfboard a little bite on a kayak that's not just a calm situation I'm not going to be like oh don't worry about it it's fine it is but a scratch no I'm gonna get out of the freaking water and probably not come back to the ocean ever again the fact that I just got riled up about shark attacks and shark things is wild to me and so maybe I should have a bit more compassion for the authors of these Washington Post articles for also getting riled up but the point is this is all ridiculous not everything needs to be political if we want to have a debate about the representation of sharks in media and the impact that has on you know ecology and Science and Marine Biology and their studies and their ability to do their work that's fine but let's not turn it into some political grab to make people feel bad about watching Shark Tank Give It Up thank you for watching the

watching the original Star Wars Trilogy we are moving on to another theme of movies I will be watching Halloween is that what this is called yes it is October so well yes it is October so we're going to be watching Halloween spooky you know spooky season themed movies I've never seen Halloween before I don't really watch horror movies so this is very exciting we've also upgraded our situation here you see we have freshly baked cookies and milk and that is because sheller's wipes at home and so as a result our situation has definitely elevated this is very exciting let's get into it this movie is older than I am that's real holy crap my pumpkin was so much better than that fair enough our first movie really yeah she's great was the back door just opened is what I have hey man it was the 60s this is before Biden's America [Laughter] [Music] is this like a demented child Michael mine is so cute [Music] oh God [Music] did oh that's terrifying the rest of the kid he's all growns up oh God he's like not conspicuous whatsoever oh my God man he's literally the most like the worst serial killer let me drive like within six feet they're also such idiots in 2022 if like a man followed me more than like three blocks I would be like I'm literally getting murdered my gun would have one in the chamber he's outside your window yeah he just rolls up 50 feet in back of them in a mask in a mask it's Halloween Aaron wouldn't do that there's parents alive what happened to them [Music] I think I ever say actually Johnny on the lawn it could have seen inside Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again never mind I guess you found a hot date [Music] I feel nothing so who's there oh is this one of your cheap trips [Music] oh good God oh my foot I'm stuck you know this meme yeah that brunette is that little girl ah no way yep what does that mean from anyway uh it's like a real housewives one of those shows got stuck in the window she'll be right here little kids sold her out God I've got a shirt on that's all you ever knew everything about so I never understood did she just get her trick-or-treating done early with I know I was about to ask like all of these kids just yeah your parents are like screw you yeah you're not you're not gonna do Halloween or she's like Joe was witness or something maybe she was homeschooled maybe she did Trunk or Treat earlier foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] no no you're all right this is totally totally coming down we're the parents they just go on like a overnight Halloween adventure yeah yeah something like that okay come on out oh [Music] [Music] I do not see the man like stabbed next to you [Music] oh my God [Music] get out of the house oh my God don't cry you idiot [Music] oh my God no [Music] okay now you run run the door's not going anywhere please [Music] I'm scared there's nothing to be scared of are you sure how You Can't Kill The Boogeyman [Music] you locked the door oh my God you left it open yo [Music] idiot he was trying to psych him out [Music]  oh God now finish him this time as if a sewing needle to the neck was actually gonna like just one she got in the artery you know it's true I'm not actually not absolutely not absolutely not are you ready you oh my God [Music] what's the boogeyman as a matter of fact it was [Music] ah that was freaking something all right thoughts um well clearly I don't get scared at any movies at all I don't get scared at all I do great in haunted houses as I'm sure you've now guessed I had no idea though that this was like the OG slasher film horror film probably because I'm not in tune with that genre so if you showed me this I would probably be like oh yeah that fits all of the horror movie tropes not knowing that they kind of originated all of them like the knitting needle Mike Myers sounds familiar I feel like people have talked about Mike Myers I wouldn't have known that that was from that well Mike Myers is technically Austin Powers it's the guy that plays awesome flowers hey I've seen that movie once oh well one of them well that makes more sense because I was like man everybody's really talking about this Mike Myers guy they must have really made him into a cool I mean I guess they did but he's close to the actor this movie started the slasher genre though it's got the guy wearing the mask yep the heavy breathing taking out the the teenagers and the whole car film I don't know if it's a Trope or just the thing where everybody just acts like a  and it's the classic like don't go into the dark house don't go into anywhere unarmed but the thing is then people take that it's not even fake if that's like objective truth of people and I was saying while we were watching it there are all these YouTube videos of like people love security cameras and they have like home invasions and you see these people doing these idiotic things absolutely moronic it's like you've just watched too many horror films so you think that that's what you do no I'm just angry that people are not prepared enough have you heard of self-reliance it's a very important skill to have seriously more people need to watch Halloween so they can learn stuff Reliance what not to do exactly this is a perfect example of what nots to do is basically an instructional backwards film but I thought it was good I liked that there was enough setup at the beginning that it was some horror films that I've seen that I don't remember the names of that it's just like made a Halloween party I feel like there hasn't been a lot of substance obviously this was still slasher but like you at the beginning you have like the doctor that was like an interesting tension and then you kind of see the girls at the beginning in their friendship so it's nice to see that kind of unravel it's kind of got a slow burn yes yeah but still the pace is because it's a slasher in addition to people being morons that guy is also like what I said while we were watching it is the worst serial killer on the face of the earth I don't know if it was just because we weren't in binds America yet we were not in like a crime-ridden world what person it's like let me stalk somebody in broad daylight stand like outside of the school stand in front of the Bush let me like stand directly in front of the window like only in front of the school yes exactly it kind of adds up because according to the doctor he like feels nothing sees nothing like the darkest eyes so he just doesn't get it and he doesn't care but anybody with like even a quarter of a brain is like oh if I'm gonna kill these people maybe I should be a little Sly it was just kind of ridiculous and it just made me angrier because I was like you people then it was the girls again being morons you see this person I don't care people are telling you you're crazy if you keep seeing the same guy six times like I said while you're watching it if a car follows me for more than six blocks I'm like changing the direction to get home I think you're victim shaming to chill out right now don't tell me to show up you need to calm down there's no way to calm down what do you think of the music I liked it yeah it freaked me out it's a classic score I liked it good when I watch it by myself no would I watch it anytime not at 3 pm during a work day probably not are you curious about like how it continues yes and that's so I didn't know I I have a friend that's been in a bunch of like the current Halloweens but I've never watched any of them because I don't do horror and so I really I did not get that that was like the same series just kind of like multiple iterations of it so now it makes sense it's like the Fast and the Furious of horror films kind of but if so the ones that your friends in if you were to watch those those basically serve as Halloween too so that the movies that your friends are in they ignore everything that comes after this movie okay yeah the series has been rebooted about four times interesting yeah yeah that kind of sucks because yeah yeah they're kind of crappy okay okay apparently my friend my friend was a beta cook I didn't know every guy in there is has like consumed an extreme amount of soy yeah what um about that one a couple more weeks until Halloween so all right well if you guys have any suggestions of course drop them in the comments we'll we'll take uh a look and and consider will terrify me another time yes before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribed to this Channel and ring that notification Bell so

"jed0UllVDFc": "it's the texture oh I hate all of it I'll give you a minute pardon me [Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock guys I'm in a bit of a predicament here today because I've been brought into the studio for a video that I really don't know much about this was kind of a surprise situation I knew that we wanted to do some kind of true or false thing which is what I will be doing but my team has put together a bit of a a hitch in the true or false game I I guess you would say I have to eat weird foods if I get these questions wrong I am not allowed to know what the foods are in advance which I actually think might be better for me because I won't get in my head and I read some weird things I was trying to like give them my Baseline of like how weird are we getting here like I've had fried Cricket tacos before I've tried liver I don't I don't know how much weirder we're gonna get they seem to be fine with it and the room doesn't smell bad so that's at least saying something but let's go ahead and get into it I have my water here my leftist tears tumbler classic so that I can um hopefully wash some things down I also have some bowls next to me in case I need to puke and that's what we call foreshadowing it definitely feels kind of like the video where I tried all the different fast foods and by the end of it I felt physically ill that might happen sheller is on the mic say hello sheller what's up all right so he's here he's gonna be asking these questions let's do it okay true or false Ben Shapiro's wife is a cardiologist I have no idea what kind of doctor she is it's messed up you don't know your what Your boss's wife does I'm so sorry what kind of employee are you false false she is a general practitioner thank God all right have a great start strong strong very strong yep had to go back in the old daily wire files there and see what I remember sharks are mammals true or false false dolphins are mammals well do you know what the factor is why they're not mammals because they breathe above water yes well dude wait do sharks also okay so like dolphins go up and get air go back down to sharks do that too no sharks have gills so they they're fish I'm so smart I'm not gonna eat any of these food I'm about to screw myself over by saying that all right true or false coffee is made from berries that's true or is it a nut no it's very it's true okay it's true I love coffee all right here we go Bobby's sitting over here in the corner like he has all these plates and he's like I'm wanting you to get it wrong if I get all these right I'll just try all the food at the end for you somebody is vacuuming in the middle of my video do they not know that I'm doing a very serious video at doing true or false questions all right this question's more down your alley so true or false a dog sweats by panting its tongue I mean I know it they express like what we would describe as being tired and sweaty panting Brown do they sweat no I mean like okay false false they sweat through their paws yes [Music] yes right I feel like I just read that somewhere and it was wrong because I was thinking about pause okay okay because I think that the panting is just like a a response but it is not the actual sweating okay four questions in you're doing good all right I'm impressed next one there are only two genders it's true false just kidding okay we got the quiz from BuzzFeed so oh just kidding okay okay the national animal of Scotland is the Unicorn if this is true y'all are so weird true or false false true no I should have done it just because it's weird what is oh I hate liquor hey we're starting you off this is this is the easy stuff okay black licorice is good come on oh God it's the texture I'm not sure ASMR for you guys do you like red licorice oh I hate all of it there's a kind of Twizzler that has like sour squishy stuff in the middle like a gooey like sour something that's okay that's acceptable it's the texture all right I'll give you a minute I forgot what I don't you guys know this I'm just like not a normal thing well a licorice no one likes licorice I like licorice my mom does I do I'm a picky eater and I love that stuff pardon me it's okay we'll just cut it out I'm sure you will I'm sure you will who eats that I mean we literally just identified you and my mother but Chad's black licorice is for the Chads yeah you and Diane all right Tom Cruise was the inspiration for Disney's Aladdin character if so why is he why has this not been canceled yet because they well I guess that would be reverse if if there was like a brown guy that was the inspiration for Disney character that they made him white that would be very funny but I guess since it's the other way around it would not be hypocritical or controversial or problematic um what does Aladdin do I mean I don't I actually don't know the answer to this one but I think it's more I'm assuming the the visual design look think about their noses all I know about Tom Cruise is that we have the same kind of teeth where they're both off center do you guys know that yeah my teeth are out centered too oh it's not like his though his are like I know mine are like semi like not as crazy but once you see it you can't unsee it and it's because I'm missing a tooth but I don't want to get an implant so I like we basically reshaped teeth to make them look well they did a good job thank you Hollywood Cosmetic Dentists see now because you said think about their noses I feel like you're leading me to say that that's true but I I genuinely don't know the answer to this ah all right I just took a peek so now I know the answer true the name of Batman's butler is Albert I've never seen Batman did you know that Batman has a butler no oh my God Albert's a nice name this is disgusting true false Alfred okay um well oh it's just a candy cane put stuff on it I'll let you get out of this one if if you can um answer a follow-up question if you can tell me the name of Alfred of Alfred's last name absolutely not okay all right is this just a candy cane or is this something crazy uh well just take a bite I'm scared this is literally just a freaking candy cane and you guys are like red this is the weirdest crap it's gonna come alive tastes like chicken soup is that normal or is that the residual black licorice I supposed to take a bite it doesn't taste normal what am I eating yeah is that ketchup flavored ketchup flavored but it wasn't wrong oh now that I know it's ketchup I don't really hate it I'll put Capture One everything like scrambled eggs is the only way I'll eat with ketchup all right that's great she's just gonna be snacking on it now I've changed my mind it did yeah I was very concerned number nine yeah Die Hard is a Christmas movie true true because it is there you go I know you wrote that question that's actually a Bobby question but really it's pretty much my question too we had that whole debate on on all access level and point about whether it's aggressive movie yes and I think there are there that are more Christmassy but it is still a Christmas movie like it happens over the course it's very holiday-esque correct correct these are all solid correct factual answers and now you should know this one because you're the resident horse girl horses can sleep while standing up that's true true it's very true okay true or false Starbucks PSL was first released in 2005. also think it was later false it was released in 2003 oh I was gonna say like 2011. I mean you were wrong but you still said false don't mean to try something no no you're well unless you really want to no but I mean I did get it wrong kind of a masochist with trying these things right now Australia that was my Irish Australian that was really bad Australia is wider than the moon false true oh is this Vegemite I have a friend whose son eats Vegemite toast every day for breakfast smells so bad the fact that it has the consistency of chocolate had you just given this to me on a spoon I would have been like oh my God it's fudge oh wow why does it taste like the you know after some supplements there's like a weird aftertaste in the back of your mouth it tastes like that mixed with you just blew out a candle and there's smoke mixed with the inside of like a fish bowl it's okay we've only got 74 more of these questions to go foreign oh God oh I I mean no no disrespect to culture why like actually why God that was a good catch you see those reflexes thank you very much your radius bone is in your leg damn it this is really embarrassing considering I was an anthropology um I actually in bioanthro I ended up with 105 in that class because my skeleton assembling skills were so incredible clearly that has not uh yeah let's put that to the channel um no it's in your arm false it's in your forearm ah big brain Machu Picchu is located in the urubamba province of Peru I have no idea I just know that it's located near Lima Peru but I don't know if that what province that is so true true or false the show Parenthood was created by Peter cross true Wait no that's the lead actor false Peter cross is in it damn it false he was created by Jason cat names let's go there's a dog trait was a dog tray what was good it's like dried salmon true or false spaghettio is the sink the fact that he just did that one in Italian is standing like four feet away from him is really exciting Bobby's Italian so I have to insult him he's fighting his tongue okay spaghetto is the singular word for a piece of spaghetti I'm looking about me to tried it that scene okay sure true yeah that's weird okay you should guess this one because this sort of is relevant to recent oh God true or false the original Star Wars came out in 1978. true false what 1977. ah I don't have to look at the answer to that one is this seaweed it says it smells like the aquarium oh God the texture oh it's gonna kill me oh God see I'm okay with like the taste of things and like the idea of eating some of this weird stuff it's the texture that kills me all I got a little bite it's very salty oh hahaha are these fish eggs or something well Secret oh just like a seaweed kind of thing I only get another one I don't want a full piece but let's just have another little Gander around here for sheller's enjoyment this really is one of those food tasting ASMR videos put that on like rock all right all right right yeah back to Business in Ohio it is illegal to get a fish drunk how do you get a fish drunk pouring alcohol in the water true unless it's some other state false of course you can oh yeah silly me and Flounder over there oh they're worms are they great or some kind of thing let's take a bite first maybe like the snacks you get as a gift shop at a science museum what does it taste like like an insect with some seasoning on it what do insects taste like crunchy and salty with like lots of little things on them like lots of little textures what is that Bobby cheddar cheese cheddar cheese flavored larvae larvae okay I'm not upset about that literally the licorice has been the worst and the Vegemite Jody Foster has one Academy Award for acting true or false false I feel like she has more Mauritius none oh false false false she has two there we go very good excellent Madonna's real name is Madonna true or false true dang true okay moving on okay this is like a homeschool question in Harry Potter Draco Malfoy Draco what the excuse me Draco Malfoy excuse me and you call yourself a movie buff he's clearly never even seen Harry Potter I've seen all the Harry Potter movies and once and they all blur together as one okay I need to shut up cinematic incoherence okay in Harry Potter Draco Malfoy is an only child true I think right oh wait no just have a little sibling ah damn it he's a sister I was so confident with that too here's a little sister he has a sister yep this is the one that I was most curious about actually I'll just get the product licked in case anybody else wants to try what is that farts what is that it's dill pickle cotton candy oh well it kind of tastes like gasoline mixed with farts and that's too bad well now I want to eat it thinking about it hold on come on here you can take that oh perfect timing for this next question hold on hold on let me get in the mindset of pickle [Music] so it doesn't work okay that was weird all right just gonna do it oh cotton candy okay perfect timing for this next question cotton candy was invented in Nashville in 1904. really that would be a weird fun fact it's true false I don't think Nashville's that cool true what wow sorry Nashville foreign language what is this Russian is this like a Ukrainian zelinski thing that is Cheeseburger inside tube smart you tried cheeseburger food tube and it has a spaceship on it so is this astronaut food you like McDonald's eh is that actually what it is what is this like chili in a tube it smells like beans and beef is this just mashed up beans it's cheeseburger is it actually it is what oh god my um this is this one's really weirding me out is this real meat I you tell us this would be perfect for good Ranchers [Music] it's the texture yeah I have a problem with ground chicken when it is being grown like the texture of it it sticks together too much it doesn't feel like it is intended to be ground when you're working with like hamburger meat making patties it's fine it's like separate enough with ground chicken it gets all gooey that's what this is I never want to see that again where are we getting all this stuff to afterwards can I make people try to run the office there are 430 representatives in the U.S house oh God pause correct false there are 435 here we go snowboarding was initially referred to as snurfing true or false like snow surfing okay true yes okay I like it it's stupid enough to make sense especially like with the snowboarding Community being as it is all right are you calling this snowboarding Community a bunch of idiots yeah and I'm one of them the liver is the largest organ in the human body false false it's the skin here we go I wasn't actually thinking about the skin but I was thinking about the contestants a person's nails and hair continues to grow after death true at least for a while I think false what skin retracts oh sort of it's sort of a misconception interesting what bug is this I feel like Nicole Kidman isn't she the one that was like I like bugs are these beetles scorpion no not scorpions what is it what I don't like like this one you can clearly see its skin and like the scales all right tastes like a dog treat it's very vinegary it's like is that like a salt and vinegar beetle mmm okay we've arrived at the last question this is the final destination destination okay the dot over a lowercase i and J is called a tittle it's true I just enjoyed you having to say that that's true yeah solid so I did it that's great you know what those weren't as bad no that was a lie Vegemite licorice you started me off strong with that one which I don't think you expected but I like I have a physical reaction to licorice the only one I spit out I'm looking at it right now and it's disgusting the other ones would not pick up on a normal basis once I got through trying to figure out what the ketchup candy cane was I wasn't angry about it it was just a bit odd kind of all that stuff I do feel like there's a weird like mental and like meant like mind-body connection of knowing that what I'm eating is like a weird bug or something but it's all tasted fine and the texture was fine like if I closed my eyes and I ate any of those grasshoppers or larvae I probably think I was eating some kind of chip but just knowing makes it weirder but it really is fine I highly suggest you guys go pick up some larvae it's gonna be a great time some dill pickle cotton candy anybody I won't lie I definitely feel a tad but queasy but it's okay I don't know what I can go eat to help this but we'll figure it out thanks for watching Everybody we'll do this again before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribe to this Channel and ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "1SPLDJFEoVI": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen we got them [Applause] welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper and hello to all one freaking million of you guys which is absolutely mind-boggling i was going to say insane but it feels bigger than insane when we started this show i don't think anybody really had an idea of how fast this was going to take off and blow up truly i can't wrap my mind around it to be completely honest but i'm so grateful that each and every one of you are here that you subscribe that you interact with me on all of these different social platforms that you watch all of these videos that you have as much of a good time as i do doing the show and watching the show so thank you from the bottom of my heart we have some very exciting things coming to celebrate hitting a million subscribers this is just the beginning like we've only been doing this for four months i have no idea what is going to happen but i know that it's going to be fun but in classic brett form i have to you know turn us down a different path because the thing we're going to talk about today is not as fun as hitting a million subscribers and that is doctors transing kids which i just kind of have to put it bluntly i did a tick tock on this video last week but as more information came out about this whole situation i realized that this should probably be a full episode because it was just too awful and there was too much happening to ignore because in 2022 your children's doctors might not be as innocent as you believe whether they know what they're doing is wrong or they're just terrified of a sick mob coming to cancel them if they don't chop off your children's boobs they are getting in between parents and children and they are pushing damaging trends just watch this is the og video that i reacted to gender firming hysterectomy is very similar to most hysterectomies that occur hysterectomy itself is the removal of the uterus the cervix which is the opening of the uterus and the fallopian tubes which are attached to the sides of the uterus some gender affirming hysterectomies will also include the removal of the ovaries but that's technically a separate procedure called bilateral oophorectomy and not every gender firming hysterectomy includes that and people who are getting gender forming hysterectomies do not have to have their ovaries removed [Music] wow thank you miss cheery doctor oh don't worry if you get a gender affirming hysterectomy as a 14 year old you might not have to have your ovaries removed we don't have to sterilize all parts of you so excited i mean that is literally as grotesque as it was the first time that i watched it after all of the videos that i have watched of you know these pediatricians these doctors talking about gender affirming care i'm still not numb to it i'm done to a lot of things on the internet these days but this is body mutilation of minors like i'm never gonna just roll over and let that happen what happened to first do no harm it's the first part of the doctor's oath when you you know get your white coat in the white coat ceremony first you do no harm seems like these days they're doing a lot of harm without asking any questions or doing any other kind of care first it's like oh you think you might be a boy let's just chop everything off maybe not let's get you in therapy and get you some help i don't know it's dick off time another person commented and said you spelled sterilization of minors incorrectly follow the money it's a much better way to put it this is not gender affirming it is literally sterilization just putting it out there if there is one thing that is certain about the medical industry it is that they want to make more money off of everything which is why crowd health is so incredible crowd health is the alternative to a broken health care system that is trying to bleed you dry of all of your money and it is not health insurance it is better it is a crowd-funded healthcare community that is capitalist and free market oriented it has no doctor networks no hidden fees no enrollment periods no hoops you have to jump through and the best part is 100 of your financial contribution every single month goes to actual health care costs for you and your fellow members which is why crowd health is able to offer such incredible prices so guys stop paying money to these healthcare companies that want to see you poor and lazy and fat and sick crowdhealth does not want any of that they want you to be healthy and able-bodied and fit and most of all they're not out here trying to trans your kids so go to joincrowdhealth.com cooper to get a special offer of 99 per month for three months again that is join crowdhealth.com cooper because in this day and age you need medical care that you can trust i mean if i have learned anything from doing this show it is that i do not trust teachers and i do not trust doctors and if you are a teacher or a doctor and you watch the show i love you and i appreciate you because you're one of the good ones and you have common sense and you give me hope so anyway that horrific video that we watched at the beginning was from the boston children's hospital which is a very well respected and well-known hospital in this country but that was not the only video that they thought was a great idea to upload online here's another one i will often know that they are transgender from the moment that they have any ability to express themselves and parents will often tell us this we have parents who tell us that their kids they knew from the minute they were born practically and actions like refusing to get a haircut or standing to urinate trying on siblings clothing playing with the quote opposite gender toys things like that there is more and more a group of adolescents that we are seeing that really are coming to the realization that they might be trans or gender diverse a little bit later on in their life so that is a growing population that they are that we are seeing and that's being recognized as being trans and able to be treated this is an actual doctor at boston children's hospital listen guys if you're a child playing with with boys toys not wanting to cut their hair that's trans go ahead send them on into the hospital let's let's get the parents money let's go ahead gender affirming care i had three older brothers i did not like wearing dresses i had i had a bowl cut if you have known me and you have seen baby pictures of me i had a freaking bowl cut i looked like a boy i had a boy's name i was the most tomboy person ever i'm sorry if your son wants to sit down while they pee that does not make them a girl that makes them tired because they have been running around playing baseball all day and they need a break it does not make them trans these are doctors these are the people that we are supposed to trust with our loved ones with our own health and our body and they are saying that if you cut your hair in a weird way your body needs to be mutilated somebody said i was a tomboy and i hated dresses then i got boobs and i loved boys yeah that's kind of how it turns out you hit puberty and you realize that being a girl isn't all that bad i still sit when i pee sometimes when i'm tired i guess i'm trans exactly the men just need a break a man sitting down it's not a bad thing guys like i understand carrying the weight of the world on your masculine shoulders sometimes you just need a rest people dug deeper into this whole thing and they found out that the boston children's hospital offers a quote full suite of transgender gender affirming surgeries and they posted over 90 of these videos promoting treatment and spreading trans awareness on their youtube channel libs of tiktok and a few other people including matt walsh got their hands on these videos started retweeting them talking about this whole situation and then of course politifact came in like the buzzkill that they are with a fact check and they said no they don't actually give surgeries to minors just look at their website but people already had and they had kept screenshots because if you look here this is from boston children's website breast removal for trans boys at age 15. previous guidance suggested that this could be done at least a year after hormones around 17 although a specific minimum age wasn't listed most genital surgeries starting at age 15 including a womb and testicle removal a year earlier than previous guidance oh we're just you know pushing up the time frame i'm sorry you might think that 17 is old enough but legally that is still a minor politifact so get it together by the time that this fact-checked graced the internet boston children's had already gone into their website the whole section with this transgender suite all the information about it and had changed the language on the website and so here's an example of some of the changes here's this page our approach to transgender reproductive health that was a few days ago now here the updated one our approach to transgender reproductive health we only perform gender affirming hysterectomies on patients who are 18 or older well that's certainly new especially in that first video where they talked about very young girls getting hysterectomies trying to change their tune without everybody else knowing but thankfully most people on the internet like myself are freaks who take screenshots of everything seriously boston children's pr team is probably working around the clock at this point but they might be getting a break because there's another hospital that needs to watch its back and it is the children's hospital of pittsburgh so if you live in pittsburgh i'm sorry in advance hi my name is priya dar i'm one of the doctors at the center for adolescent and young adult health here at the children's hospital of pittsburgh i wanted to talk to you guys today a little bit about puberty blockers how about news are basically a medication that says hey let's just put a pause on puberty and that can be really beneficial for younger kids who have start already started the puberty process who either might go through a lot of psychological distress as they go through puberty if they're struggling with gender dysphoria or for somebody who's saying hey i'm not really sure if i feel comfortable in my body or or what gender i truly identify with oh yes puberty blockers we just put a pause let's just let's just slow down puberty i'm sorry is this generation so sensitive that they are triggered by puberty that we just need to halt it i'm not comfortable in myself normal biology that's been going on for millions of years i can't handle it let's pause it let's do irreversible damage to my body again these are the people that are supposed to be protecting and caring for your children when really they are destroying their bodies do you not like why are they putting this on the internet they're so smug about it i mean i actually know the answer of why they are putting all of this online and it is because medicine is a business and they make millions of dollars doing experimental gender affirming care on children so obviously they are going to promote it as much as they can with absolutely no regard for any kind of morality apparently liz wheeler tweeted and said and people wonder why i'm inherently deeply skeptical of all pediatricians these creeps are taking care of our kids exactly and again if i have doctors that watch the show i'm obviously not speaking to you but i do think it's important to point out that there are so many people that are waking up to the corruption within the medical industry i mean like covid was a huge wake-up call people learned a lot when they were dealing with the vaccine learning how much doctors get paid when they push pharmaceuticals on kids there has just kind of been an uproar of people going hold on like i have my eyes have been closed i've been blindly trusting this i need to be more careful and it's people like this who are being creepy who are sterilizing children who are pushing this even though it is political it is a trend like you are a doctor you should be above that all of this kind of reminds me of some smaller scale situations that libs of tick tock has shed a light on recently these are more individual experiences but it all kind of ties back together just watch the stick talk so we just took my three-year-old son in the doctor for a checkup my three-year-old son so my wife and i are waiting in the room with our son and the doctor comes in and he sees my son sitting there on the table and the first question that he asks him is are you a boy or are you a girl and i look at my wife like so luckily my son understands obvious tenants of biology at three years old and says that he's a boy just like his chart says and call me paranoid but this is where i think we're heading based on other things that have happened an ohio couple lost custody of their teenager for refusing them hormone treatment and a divorce texas couple were in a court battle over whether or not to let their seven year old transition from a boy to a girl and many are saying that the new proposed equality act could lead to more parents losing custody of their kids who want gender transition but here's the thing my son is three i'm not even going to let him choose what he wants for dinner and some days my son thinks he's a dinosaur but i'm not gonna let him transition to a dinosaur and being in california this is probably gonna happen to people like me first but i don't think it's gonna be long before we start seeing parents lose custody of their young kids because they're not letting them transition to the opposite gender first of all that dad is so based and that kid is so lucky to have a father who has common sense who was rational he was unafraid to you know step out and protect his child because so many other people but so many other children are not as lucky and they have parents that are cucks for lack of a better word who are bought into all of this gender ideology propaganda who are willing to let their kids say oh at three years old yep i'm a girl and i have a video of this exact thing happening kids have to go to the pediatrician a certain number of times for the first few years of their life at the three year checkup they ask a question to see if the children know the difference so the pediatrician looked at bug and she said are you a boy or a girl bug looked her in the eye and said i'm a girl the doctor kind of looked at me i was like all right never heard about it before but whatever and ever since that day she has told us that she's a girl a little under a year ago she started correcting us on her pronouns i'm not at him i'm a her don't call me he mommy i'm not he i'm she it has been two and a half years now that she has been out i told her father when i figured she was getting close to telling him herself didn't want him to respond poorly so what we can clearly see from this is that that father has not had a singular experience apparently this is something that is happening around the country pediatricians are asking children are you a boy or girl and maybe that is something that has been going on for a while of again asking if your child knows the difference between a man and a woman but that's not a very simple question to ask in 2022 considering people believe that gender is non-binary that men and women are kind of the same thing but also very different that three-year-olds can decide that they are something else that question is not as black and white as it used to be so pediatricians either need to acknowledge that it is a political question or they need to get rid of it altogether because parents like this are going to take that and run with it and start transitioning their three-year-old so that at five years old they are out that's psychotic that child did not come out of the chute just believing that it could be transgender you did this as simple as that in what world is it appropriate to ask a toddler their gender so that you can insinuate that they might be trans that they might need gender affirming care oh they might need a hysterectomy at 15 years old 14 years old they might need to get their boobs chopped off because your kid isn't wanting to grow out their hair or they're wanting to sit while peeing no that does not mean you need to be shipped off to the operating room doctors are getting in between children and their parents it's very similar to what we've been seeing over the past couple of years with these radical politicized teachers this also reminds me of a situation in washington where a father found out that his 15 year old son had been prescribed anti-depressants by the school nurse and had not been told because in washington starting at age 13 your children can consent to medical procedures without parents knowing 13 years old including gender affirming care so do not tell me that doctors are not getting in between families they are like news flash you do not have rights over these children leave them alone 99 of the time parents know what is best for their children they don't need you stepping in to make decisions without their knowledge or consent so that you can either make more money or just feel more virtuous that's not how it works keep your hands off the children guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel

doing a buzzfeed quiz or one of those things no my producer bobby has put together a customized quiz just for me to see how well i know pop culture now if you watch my videos you know that i talk about pop culture a lot but it's kind of niche i think like there are specific things that i really follow and i'm really interested in and then i'll kind of you know fake it until i make it with other things and then also if you follow me for a while you also know that i was raised in a household where we did not watch any television i did not have a phone until you know much later on was not allowed to really have access to the internet i was you know out in the woods reading jane austen at a very young age basically like the nerd that i am so as a result there are many many years you know in my life that i had no idea what was going on so if there are questions from that period it might be embarrassing um but you know what that's fine i usually you know embarrass myself on the show regardless so it's humanizing so anyway let's go ahead and get started this is how well does brent know pop culture okay uh what does this what does the acronym smh stand for okay so this is embarrassing because i thought that it was so much hate and i realized through you guys in my comments telling me that no bret it's not that it is actually shake my head but for a long time i thought that it was so much hate which kind of i guess works in my mind they seem the same and when i text it i still think so much hate which doesn't make sense but it's just what i knew i don't know where i got that from but you know shake my head there we go or shaking my head all right which performer had a wardrobe malfunction during the super bowl 38 halftime show oh for some reason i'm thinking of michael jackson's younger sister or whatever but that was a different event janet janet janet jackson is it actually it oh my god for some reason i thought that that was something that happened at the

expensive did you see that thing that he um made it is a full black suit where it like it's footy pajamas but it covers your head and it has like gloves and it's like a woman's like sleek i was like kanye i mean i'd buy it because it's for you but why nobody on earth wants to wear that except you and maybe me now um all right which artist had the most streamed song globally on spotify 2021 taylor swift maybe no i feel like it was me like taylor swift or for some reason i'm thinking like morgan wallin or something i have no idea i'm gonna go taylor swift because her new albums came out like her

like oh god like obviously she was in a very abusive you know legal situation with her father but she needs help should we really just like spit her out into the world after you know 14 years of this um but now she really seems to be holding her and she's adjusted i don't know if you guys saw that interview that her son gave where he was basically like our relationship is you know uh you know it can never be repaired and she's unstable and all this and she's posting her responses to him on instagram in these audio messages because he won't respond to her it's honestly very heartbreaking but she seems very you know like i don't say stable but like level-headed in those messages so it's interesting but britney spears there we go one point what actor was forced to resign for the fantastic beasts franchise but still received 60 million dollars johnny depp yay good boy johnny okay which famous actor went to space on jeff bezos's second crude blue origin flight well i do know that pete davidson was supposed to go on i think the third one or maybe it was the second one and then he backed out which was honestly a huge disappointment to me because i really wanted to see p davidson in

matrix i've never seen that it always my brother really likes it but i would walk into our tv room when i was maybe 10 or 11 or something like that my brother reed and i would see him watching it and i would always get so freaked out and the tv room was right outside of my childhood bedroom and we had this little area and it was the only place where you were allowed to watch television and we didn't have cable or anything you had to like put in your dvds and you know we had our vhs tape so it was basically what we watched um but i would hear him watching it and it creeped me out so much

sort of based she's given actually both of those women are because both of them have talked about like their guns and their you know they love freedom and i think i mean carrie underwood definitely has some animals but she's just like a good down-home girl from oklahoma and kelly clarkson i know i think maybe has some kind of farm now too but she's you know out doing her based stuff all right

semi-self-made she was self-made by her sister sex tape which then launched a uh very very famous reality tv show and then she you know obviously her beauty brands and all of that are incredibly successful and she did that on her own and she runs those businesses but the steps that it took to get her to that platform i wouldn't really say self-self-made but she is a badass she she runs those businesses so anyway yeah kylie jenner um the republic of gilead is a totalitarian state in which uh margaret atwood novel that would be the handmaid's tale that tv show i have seen is actually fantastic i hate that it got super political at the end but if you just take all of the bs from around it and the creators and all of the political statements they try to make about america actually is a fantastic show with incredible acting the book's great too uh rapper drake rose to fame as an actor on which tv show i did not know he was an actor can he act he kind of reminds me of like a cardboard cutout i don't think i've ever seen him make a facial expression never heard of degrassi de grazie de gracie the next generation never heard of it that's probably going to give me shane in the comments that's one thing i'm guessing people are like genuinely never heard of it what is the name of the mother on how i met your mother ah damn it i feel like i've blocked it out because that was like the worst ending of a television show ever i preferred the alternate ending that they didn't release that was like such a letdown i forget her name but then you know she dies and sorry spoiler alert and he realizes that he's been in love with robin the whole time and robin's finally ready to beat with him so that's all i care about uh tracy literally would have never guessed i would

did my research alright so bobby what is my score i'm telling your score right now all right i'm ready okay 46 out of 100. you know what this is really a letdown i thought that i was really on here the last the questions at the end though i will say i kind of knew that that was not going to turn out well for me but there were some that i you know really hit a home run on they just happened to be the one point questions for good reason because they were probably very easy feel free to roast me in the comments for my lack of pop culture knowledge i will say though i have become much more pop culturally literate since doing the show than i ever have been i think it's a blessing and a curse because now i think i'm more engaged with my generation what we're kind of interested in but in a way i also miss my days of bliss when i basically just read books and didn't think about any of these people uh and some of my friends have said oh my god i can't believe that you go on twitter and your you know algorithm looks like that and the crazy things you see on tiktok that you know i've kind of worked my algorithm so that i'm getting content for the show as a result in my personal life it's kind of like oh gosh what am i looking at and oh i'm being bombarded with celebrities but you know it works out and i do feel like i am engaged and if i'm going to be part of this culture war and you know part of you know attempting to be a good influence and you know maybe hopefully influence society in a way that i think you know is good obviously you can do whatever you want uh then i should

people online i mean you look up drew barrymore and all of the current articles right now are about this tick tock fiasco because people were so damn confused about what this woman was saying and what she was so angry about she had the crazy eyes and she had the ridiculous piercings so even before she opened her mouth you knew that she was gonna be pissed i drew about something now obviously this woman noticed that there was a bit of a firestorm surrounding her response so she tried to give an explanation and it really only made me more confused why is it an issue for me to stand firm in what i believe male black craters frolicked in the grass female black creators started frolicking in the rain okay oh poor drew had a hard childhood says the white woman to the black woman in america i'm not picking nobody is picking on her i pointed out the obvious y'all still went out of your way to demean me put me down call me out my name dismiss my opinion on my own tick-tock but defend drew in her hard childhood yeah she's the only one who ever had a hard childhood she's the only one who's ever tried to get her inner child like out and have fun she was frolicking in the rain which meant she opened the floodgates for people who go out of their way to disrespect black creator but y'all didn't hear that y'all just heard oh my gosh she's calling us racist his name isn't racist y'all are so reactionary you're so ready to react nobody listens to respond i say when i say it she's calling everybody who watched her video and commented on it reactionary and all you're calling me out man you were reactionary you made a hostile angry video about drew barrymore and tried to say that it was racist not cool not frank and cool then you kind of backtracked by saying oh it wasn't really about drew like i know she has a hard childhood everybody has had a hard childhood whatever it was about the bigger issue then what it what is the bigger issue that there are also videos of black people frolicking in the rain on the app are they the only ones who are allowed to and because of that drew posting a video is racist it makes no sense you can go second by second in this damn video and find some kind of inconsistency and something to give you a headache listen there's a lot to see in this life not wasting it here to save us all that heartache a good-hearted woman attempted to crack the code and try to explain what this one was talking about so here's that video i did some investigation and i think what the woman is talking about when she talks about boundaries and racism and cultural appropriation no it sounds ridiculous i think there was a trend with black creators frolicking in the wilderness and nobody kicked up much of a fuss about it and i think it was something that black creators were doing and that's that then through barrymore frolicked in the rain and everybody kicked up with us about it and she's basically saying this was something for black creators as a means of expressing freedom that the world doesn't allow them to express i guess it's a stretch honestly when i saw it i just thought all right that's a white woman frolicking in the rain oh wait that's true barrymore my reaction to stuff and just like everybody else it depends on where i'm at in my life so sometimes i see stuff like that and i'm like ah typical white woman and of course that's just me being but her and sometimes i'm like oh cute she's dancing in the rain it really just depends where i'm at i will admit that and i do know that i do have a prejudice towards white women sometimes because of the history that i have with them i think this is what this person might also be experiencing this is just my observation okay i can't do any more of this because it's another 30 seconds long and basically now she's going back and forth about reactions to things but that honestly didn't give me a headache at the end i'm just saying but i did appreciate her analysis of the entire thing so black creators there was a trend they were frolicking drew barrymore was not trying to follow a trend she was just having a happy moment outside of her looks like her new york apartment frolicked in the rain and then apparently that woman took it personally what i do like about this creator is that she is talking about how people's reactions to things do change depending on what is going on in their life where they're at their mental state and maybe this woman was just having an awful day and it seems like she's very progressive and woke which means that she is probably sad and miserable and angry about things usually which will just add fuel to the fire so basically guys what we can learn from this is that if black people do a trend first white people are not allowed to do it and then we have solved racism fixed all of the problems in the world and tick tock becomes the greatest app in the entire world basically while also creating a greater racial divide but all in all the entire situation did give me hope because people called this woman on how ridiculous her response to drew was and the woman was ratioed into oblivion and her account actually got blocked and taken down so all of the og comments have been deleted but people took it to twitter and have been talking about it for the last couple of days this tweet from actress yvette nicole brown who is usually very progressive but she said just saw why drew barrymore is trending i believe in fighting racism but this is not that it is not racist for drew to enjoy the rain number two she was not mocking the beautiful video of our brothers frolicking calling everything racist provides cover for actual racists shocking that is such a simple truth and wow just like calling everything oppression and calling people nazis throwing these words around diminishes actual hardship so from somebody who is usually really lib i do appreciate this another person said as a member of the black community i am willing to make a race trade the whites can have her is it possible that we can get amy schumer and some person said y'all can have amy schumer for free literally uh another person said green is the color of the grass that needs to be touched yes and rocks need to be kicked by this woman i mean i honestly feel sad because clearly she has some stuff going on and apparently lives such a miserable life that she spends her time on tick-tock complaining about people having a nice day like drew was not stealing anything from you she was not appropriating your culture she was not harming any minors she was not doing anything illegal she was just having a nice day frolicking in the rain being radiant so get a grip don't touch grass guys we are adding new comment section content

actually so excited to do this segment because you all have found out over time that i really like harry potter in the middle of an episode last week my phone went off you all learned that the harry potter soundtrack is my ringtone so i really exposed myself there but it has been many many years since i was on pottermore taking harry potter quizzes so i felt like it was only right that i do an update i am now on the official wizardingworld.com website we have a sorting hat quiz a patronus quiz and a wand quiz to simulate being it ollivanders so i'm very excited i only ever did the house um test back on pottermore and i think i was i think we determined on a live stream the other day that i am gryffindor even though it is such a weird thing to be like i'm gryffindor because you know it's harry potter and ron and hermione and everybody wants to be gryffindor but i do feel like it lines up for me but years before that when i was in maybe fourth grade right after i read the books for the first time i did a quiz and it said i was hufflepuff i don't think i'm social and bubbly enough to be a hufflepuff so i don't really know so we're gonna get the answer for sure today this is what's happening so let's go ahead and start i'm gonna go ahead here get sorted now okay i will thank you choose one to continue [Music] i like the moon okay a troll has gone berserk in headmaster study at hogwarts it is about to smash crush and tear several irreplaceable items and treasures in which order would you rescue these objects from the trolls club if you could a nearly perfected cure for dragon pox oh wait they don't show me the other ones maybe i can later [Music] they too okay can i move them around student records going back to a thousand years okay that one i guess a mysterious handwritten book full of strange runes okay reorder items okay first a mysterious handwritten book full of strange runes then a nearly perfected cure for dragon pox finally student records going back 1000 years um i kind of want how do i reorder reorder oh oh hello is it bad that i want the cure last maybe but it kind of seems like a big deal oh god i don't know reorder reorder okay this one's gonna go ah okay no that one this one this one because you never know what's gonna be in the handwritten book i just okay i'm doing that okay which would you rather be liked trusted feared envied intimidated or praised um um cannot envied intimidated like i would be intimidated or intimidate other people not praise i don't need to get praise um indeed i don't really care about being liked maybe trusted okay if you're attending hogwarts which pet would you choose to take with you uh definitely not an owl because i don't like birds [Music] uh toad's slimy so definitely a cat ginger cat white cat siamese cat tabby cat black cat i want the fluffiest one that one's pretty fluffy i like it after you've died what would you most like people to do when they hear your name ask for more stories about your adventures miss you but smile think with admiration of your achievements uh i don't care what people think of me after i'm dead it's what they think of me while i'm alive that counts kind of that but also maybe achievements um probably that all right you and your two friends need to cross a bridge guarded by a river troll who insists on fighting uh one of you before he will let all of you pass do you let's see um volunteer to fight attempt to confuse the troll into letting all three of you pass without fighting suggested all three of you fight without telling the troll suggest drawing lots to decide which of you will fight um maybe that one confusing the troll heads okay oh all right let's see the sorting hand is ready to make its decision [Music] oh my god slytherin slytherin okay pride ambition and cunning i mean i do have a lot of pride and i am ambitious so okay you probably know that some slytherins some of slytherin's most renowned members include severus snape and bellatrix lestrange but did you know that merlin himself was a slytherin and that according to legend the ribbon of a first-class order of merlin is agreeing to reflect his hogwarts house um fellow slytherins love that okay interesting i've never i don't think i've ever gotten slytherin before but i feel like as i've grown up maybe probably maybe like slytherin or gryffindor who knows i'm not mad about it i've never had anything against slytherin um i feel like i'm more i don't want to say that i'm bubbly but i think i may be somewhat happier than some slytherins but again we only saw how some specific slytherins were portrayed in the books um so i don't know maybe that's just my perception maybe i don't know enough about the slytherin house but yeah i don't know i'm okay i'm happy with that you guys let me know in the comments alright let's do my patronus i wonder is pottermore still a thing i oh gosh it's making sounds oh look it says pottermore i loved pottermore i never got to play video games but the video games that i did video games i did play were all the pottermore games and then american girl doll had video games and i was allowed computer time on my dad's big work pc that i was allowed to play on this is cool all right questions are timed go with your instincts okay this one's cool relax think of your happiest memory okay this is sick protect um cold i like this this is super cool it's trying to form impressed oh my god it's happening i want this all the time when i move my cursor up click and drag click drag and release oh my god it's a bird it's a pheasant now that is irony how did i end up with a bird patronus when i'm terrified of birds this has just been a very weird experience i'm not a gryffindor i have a bird as a patronus well maybe now this is my sign that i need to like birds because my bird my pheasant is here to be my guardian all right goodbye pheasant goodbye i'm returning to my profile now we have one last one to do wand maybe this will also be out of the ordinary all right harry potter here you go brett cooper her pheasant this is crazy oh wait now we have some information about it what does your patronus say about you i want to know that where is the pheasant um okay dolphin cat no say why couldn't i have gotten a saint bernard i want to saint bernard um okay unicorn sewing al stagg there's even a ragdoll cat those are super cute pheasant isn't even in the top 20. does that mean i'm super special what does a pheasant mean does that mean you're super strange and brett we hate you and we know that you're terrified of birds i wonder if i can just google it pheasant okay here we go mugglenet pheasants are noble birds known for their beautiful plumage they are regal and often symbolize virtue and refinement okay here we go they are regal and often symbolize virtue and refinement unlike peacocks they make no show of their feathers but hold themselves to a high standard of etiquette in all situations they can be a bit proud which might lead to trouble but deep down they are greatly though they care greatly for family and comfort i mean actually that's not wrong so maybe they got it right who knows so i'm not angry about that good job wizarding world all right last one wand here we go the official wand ceremony this better have some cool graphics too i liked the patronus one um would you describe yourself as i mean like tall for a girl i guess sort of and your eyes are hazel uh the fact that you had to like think about that even number pride yourself most on probably brazilians traveling alone down a deserted road you reach a crossroads do you continue left towards the sea right towards the castle ahead towards the forest um probably towards the castle do you most fear fire small spaces darkness isolation or heights definitely isolation in a chest of magical artifacts which would you choose silver dagger golden key dusty bottle ornate mirror glittering jewel black glove or a bound scroll maybe a dagger that's cool here we go what is it nope no definitely not laurel wood with a phoenix core 13-inch and rigid flexibility okay laurel wood it is said that a lara wood wand cannot perform a dishonorable act although in the quest for glory a not uncommon goal for those best suited to these wands i have known laurel wants to perform powerful and sometimes lethal magic laurel wands are sometimes called fickle but this is unfair the laurel wand seems unable to tolerate laziness in a possessor and it is in such conditions that it is most easily and willingly won away otherwise it will cleave happily to its first match forever and indeed has the unusual and engaging attribute of issuing a spontaneous lightning strike if another witch or wizard attempts to seal it that's cool [Music] i mean that's very positive i like it they do not tolerate laziness i don't tolerate laziness i hate lazy people um let's see that's basically all it tells me that's very cool i'm happy with that i will say the house thing has still stumped me i'm not angry about it but literally every time i've taken one of these tests i get something different so i don't really know maybe i'm just maybe i'm so unique what is it you know all those people that are like you just can't box me and it's sort of like the whole gender and sexuality fluidity whatever i'm guys i'm just so fluid i'm i'm harry potter house fluid you cannot box me in i'm non-binary when it comes to harry potter houses no i don't know uh but let me know your houses in the comments and if you think that any of these quizzes got it wrong let me know or if there are other quizzes that i should take in the harry potter metaverse let me know because as you know i am obsessed and i will take any opportunity to dive deeper into this fandom thank you very much and no i have still not watched star wars but i'm getting around to it and then i can do those kinds of quizzes i promise before you

thinking a lot about elections recently obviously the midterms just happened we all probably had some you know conflicting feelings about that but as the midterms were occurring Trump dropped some hints that he would be making a huge announcement at Mar-A-Lago on November 15th we have all been waiting since then to know what Mr Donny T was going to tell us all and yesterday was that day but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brad to check out my merch collection I was at dinner as all of this was about to happen clearly I was not super emotionally invested in it I knew that my phone would start blowing up the moment that it occurred so I didn't really need to be glued to my television or my computer but even so I kept you know checking my phone checking the trending page and there was nothing nothing about Trump nobody was talking everybody was just kind of sitting silently until this FEC filing popped up on Twitter and this screenshot that I have is from disclose.t TV but the original screenshot I saw was from some random account and I was like this can be real he hasn't made the announcement yet people are just finding this finally I don't even know if this is legit guys it's legit okay it's happening everybody stay calm what's the procedure and then a few minutes later the entire world not really whoever was watching the stream heard this in order to make America great and glorious again I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States he said that so casually too which is so astonishing for Trump I would have thought that there was going to be some kind of like Air Force Brigade behind him fireworks he was gonna be like you know doing the YMCA dance no he was like you know what I'm running it's fine you can't do anything about it you thought you'd never see me again didn't you well too bad I'm alive he's freaking back guys and now you know I have had my qualms with Trump recently I don't think he has been as strong as he used to be I hated how he was going after DeSantis I thought that some of his endorsements during the midterms were a bit weak but I have never been a never Trumper I like him I think that he was a strong president you know what I totally ate my words last night because he is strong and it is worth watching his speech in its entirety but I have a few clips for you just so you can get a taste of what went on last night in Florida we must conduct a top to bottom overhaul to clean out the festering rod and Corruption of Washington DC we will not let men as an example participate in women's sports is that okay nowhere no men my people tell me sir that's Politically Incorrect to say I said that's okay I'll say it anyway if you don't mind we will defend the rights of parents and we will defend the family as the center of American life but who would think standing up here 10 years ago 15 years ago that a politician and I don't like to think of myself as a politician but I guess that's what I am I hate that thought but that a politician would be up saying we will defend parental rights of course you can offend to who would think that we even have to mention this who would think it even should be a subject to be talked about we have to defend parental rights can you believe this under our leadership we were a great and glorious Nation something you haven't heard for quite a long period of time but now we are a nation in Decline we are a failing Nation for millions of Americans the past two years under Joe Biden have been a time of pain hardship anxiety and despair you can say that again also cringe constant cringe head in the sand basically he's so self-aware that's one of the things you know Dave Chappelle talked about this in his most recent SNL Monologue and he basically said to this audience this obviously very liberal audience he said if you want to know why people like Trump it's because yes he is an elite he is up there he's so rich he's with all those people but he's an honest Elite he's self-aware Elite he's like yeah yeah I do use all those tax breaks and you know why I use them it's because you guys allow me to and all of you other Democrats you use them as well anyway I I digress guys he was on fire it is so good he is doing what he does best he is talking about culture he is saying I will defend the American people I will be the Block in between the Elites in between the journalists and all of this stupid psychotic ideology I will protect you from that this is 2016 Trump back in Action if he can hold on to this and let go at some of that egotistical stuff that he's been up to recently the Jabs at DeSantis he's really weak you know endorsements all of that he might actually have a shot which is shocking to me I did not think I would say that I thought that if he did announce that he was running it was going to be an absolute show but that was strong and I hate the fact that he is so good at appealing to emotions because I am so susceptible to it I do really want DeSantis but you know what this man he knows how to work it but many people are still split Caleb whole tweeted and said if Trump is the nominee in 2024 I would still vote for him over a Democrat but pretending that he is the best option for us right now specially giving his pointless attacks on other Republicans during a midterm election is just silly and cultish we can do better overall I do agree even though right now emotionally I am pulled to him I do think that we have a better option into Santa's long term and I also want to be consistent with something in that I often say that Biden is way too old to be president I cannot say that and then turn around and just be glorifying Trump because Trump is basically the same age as Biden and obviously I think that he is mentally in a better place he looks healthy he looks like he's ready to do his old YMCA dance but he is still almost 80 years old we have way too many Elder politicians in Washington we need younger energy we need Vibrance I desperately want somebody younger to go in and Shake It Up and as much as I really like the guy like I do think that both of those men they have done their time they served a purpose they did their things it's time to let another generation in I'm having so much fun like I just I want to preserve this moment maybe we could actually use Legacy box to do that my sponsored Legacy box makes reclaiming and preserving your favorite memories even political ones incredibly easy some of my most cherished political memories are my brother and I sitting in front of the TV watching the

preserved for this holiday season meanwhile I will be sitting around remembering the good old days of 2016 Trump Lindsey Graham has also totally changed his tune after last night because if you guys have followed any of the things that Lindsey Graham has done he threw Trump under the bus so much if president Trump continues this tone and delivers this message on a consistent basis he will be hard to beat I agree his speech tonight contrasting his policies and results against the Bible Administration charts a winning path for him in the primaries and general election I agree with that first part of it but I also think Lindsey Graham is missing the point yes he can contrast you know how people felt under him versus Biden but again it's culture what he does really well is appealing to emotions and talking about culture and currently that is what Democrats do best and it is what they have to lose so we obviously need to adapt and welcome to Sweet it out and said if you think the woke mob is mad now just wait until Trump identifies as a woman and becomes our first female president I would love that Donna Trump that'd be great now this guy said anyone who supports Donald Trump is a traitor rooting for the end of American democracy find a better line you people just it's stale the end of democracy it is stale now interestingly enough there was not a lot of liberal hubbub on Twitter after this announcement I really haven't checked this morning to see but last night it was pretty calm which was shocking to me however the journalists the journalists were ready to go especially NPR this is the craziest headline I saw they said breaking Donald Trump who tried to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election and inspired a deadly riot at the Capitol and a desperate attempt to keep himself in power has filed to run for president again in 2024. are we still talking about January 6th are we still saying that it was deadly that's a lie NPR is lying one person actually died this was not some debt I can't even get into it I don't even need to do that I mean just imagine in some you know idealistic utopian world where journalists simply said breaking former president Donald Trump files to run for president again you leave it at that and you allow people to come to their own conclusions you allow people to read the story you allow people to look at the facts instead you insert political bias into literally everything not just bias but straight up lies somebody replied and said defund NPR yes that is actually trending right now still this morning defund NPR which is great this person said this is the energy we need from the media snaps this other person said Biden's got this really does he does he I don't even think that Biden was awake for this announcement but his team did release this video and according to Ben Shapiro Biden's team started sending out fundraising emails while Trump was also speaking so they were ready to go but here's this video my faith is not in Biden whatsoever their entire economic plan tax cuts for the rich and corporations and record-breaking unemployment the worst jobs report on record Trump is the only modern president to leave office with fewer jobs than when he took office the Trump Administration formally asking the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act you also had people that were very fine people on both sides do you believe in punishment for abortion yes or no there has to be some form of punishment for the woman yeah it has to be some form and if I win it's always we will treat those people from January 6 fairly and if it requires pardons we will give them pardons Trump failed America Biden is not even a cognitively aware enough to know what is going on in that video literally somebody replied to that and said he did not fail America respectfully you have sir mic drop that is Trump's announcement I'm sure you're going to be hearing a lot about it for the next few weeks for the next couple of years I have no idea whether you guys are going to be absolutely fired up or you're going to be exhausted I personally feel like I have just been put into a washing machine and have been like spun around a lot I am so exhausted between the midterms and this and just the culture just in general but you know what maybe something good will come out of this I mean he really does look strong he's popping off he's about he's probably doing his little dance all of that stuff I don't know there's gonna be a lot of content coming out of this campaign buckle up guys it's coming thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this channel turn on your notifications like this video and of course if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper see you next time", "2VaWKuvQ7Ys": "foreign [Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock today guys we are diving even deeper into Brett Cooper's holiday Obsession now one thing about me is that I love giving gifts I love buying people things I want to like shower everybody in my life with like love and little Trinkets and that sort of thing I'm just when I love somebody I just wanna I just want to buy you all the things however I get very stressed around birthdays and Christmas and that sort of thing because I feel like the pressure mounts I'm really good but it's just like oh I saw something and let me think of you and I'm gonna give it to you whatever when it's like a day that stresses me out and there's like more than one person I have to shop for so I was talking with my team about like the holiday and Christmas gift guides that are trending on Tick Tock and how I've actually like used some of them and that sort of thing and so they pulled some of these and then some outrageous gifts for me to react to and it reminded me actually of uh a gift my dad gave my mom many years ago bless his heart I don't know if he was trying or it was just so off base but my mom she ran a cooking school in San Francisco for many years she worked her way through high school and college by working at Bakery she would get up at like 3 A.M in the morning go to the bakery in college she focused more on baking people cheesecakes during finals week than the finals themselves I'm pretty sure if you had a little cart and she would bake cheesecakes and then she had a little Waffle business during college too like she had a Chef's Kitchen she has every single Gadget and fantastic like commercial kitchen appliance that you could think of and for Christmas my dad got her a hot dog toaster my mom hates hot dogs and it's bright red and it has two little slots for hot dogs and then it had the little slots for the Buns like my mom maybe we'll have like a bratwurst but she hate like we never had hot dogs in my house ever that's the thing with gift giving you have to get out of your own self and you have to think about the other person that's the whole fun of it all that being said the holidays are upon us I'm sure you guys are shopping you're stressing about gifts so I'm gonna react to some of these gift guides so I can tell you guys what not to buy or maybe we'll have some great options in here but uh shout out to Reagan who pulled all of these for me to react to We have some tick tocks first like this is really trending on here here are some gift ideas for guys that will cost you under fifty dollars this is a great way to introduce some of the skincare for 30 days are a really cheap way to show somebody that you keep up with their interests lightly over budget but they're super trendy and comfortable no no do not buy those slides those are so gross I'm so sorry I know that you guys men you wear your little slides at the gym at the pool do not encourage them outside of a gym environment or the beach I hate them and then your feet kind of hang out the front of them and you're wiggling you're gross gross Funko pops are cute though if you're dating somebody that's like nerdy or whatever I don't know anything about them but I remember having friends in high school that had like a collection of 50 of them so I guess that's fine I remember watching some of these videos though trying to find present ideas for my older brother who is just notoriously hard to shop for because anything that he wants he just buys so I was like searching like gifts for a brother like best like male gift guides they were all like the most Metro beta cooked gift guides I'd ever seen like this Exquisite fancy like french press but not a French press whatever that's gonna no I mean maybe you're really into coffee and that's cool but I'm not gonna get like my rugged Carhartt wearing you know diesel truck driving brother a freaking fan fancy ass French press the man drinks Folgers where are those gift guides I always end up getting him a Home Depot gift card it's probably what's going to happen now sorry Chase if you're watching this here's more guys that's nice I guess again for my brother no but that's cool I just don't like this trend with guys like that isn't when I see all that together that's not a guy that I'd be like oh he's really cool but also that's just not who I'm into and not who's like around me that'd be really funny though if I got my brother like Air Jordans and like baggy pants I think he would disown me literally I absolutely love getting past orders um this time a customer has asked to add thongs to our jars of pickled buns what oh my God so cute I love a jar of pickled but what is that you don't eat that do you that's horrific don't buy somebody that you can buy them a gag gift but that's like it has no purpose get that off of my screen what is that okay this is weird I think those are all the gift guides for guys but I wanted to show some of the girl ones because these have all come up on my feed and it's weird because they're all broken up into these categories it's like the gift guide for that girl self-care Edition and then there was a lot of them like gift guide for the cool girl like if you type in like girl gift guide it all is the cool girl I don't think that I'm a cool girl I look at these guys and it's like I don't really think that's what I want if guy for the girl who has everything self-care Edition just met with this brand the other day and their whole focus is sheet masks and they just came out with this like uh plant-based milk sheet mask line they look like little milk cartons I don't want like oat milk sheet mask no I don't like that you knew it was coming the Uggs are back with the Vengeance and I think these Miniatures and they're on my list this year actually I personally don't love Uggs but I do like those slippers I wouldn't say the minis but like the Ugg slippers I don't have a pair of slippers maybe I should ask for a like nice pair of slippers like the Ugg ones are cool but Uggs themselves like I genuinely feel like if I came home this Christmas wearing Uggs Diane would like kick me out at least we're not doing like the thigh high with like the infinity scarf these facial razor sets though that she's about to talk about they are useful but like why buy them for somebody like I pick those up once a month and this is for the girl who has everything she I guarantee she has that I don't even have everything and I have like six of these in my bathroom I have both a large theragon and a therapist I love them both the theragon mini is so much cheaper it's super easy to travel with and you get the same experience as the fair gun for like the Layman that actually is like the pandemic totally rebranded puzzle this one is obviously super cute and it's from the June Market which is a great small business to look for Christmas gifts shower Steamers are like a bath bomb for your shower they're so amazing and more people need to know about them that's cool especially like I feel like smaller gifts if you're doing a combination of like face masks and like if you do a self-care package one thing that I do like to put together for gifts is I will get a bunch of things on theme and then I'll make a little basket it's like a fruit basket of fun things but yeah don't give them by themselves you want to mix it all together with a little note maybe a snack a wine glass God I'm so good I should run everybody's life here we go see again the cool girl here we go gifts for the cool girl I think that's my life okay maybe you are the cool girl and in that case send this to your boyfriend send this to your girlfriend send this to your brother your sister your mom your dad I don't care a girl send it to them okay I don't really like this is just an aside this whole new personality on Tick Tock I'm gonna I don't know how to describe it what is that stop it talk normally I don't want to deal with that Verge girl it's kind of expensive but they have a lot of very unique pieces that I love pajamas they look like outdoor pajamas another Unique Piece that's pretty that's very pretty it's cool it's fun that if you're a guy with good taste like buy don't buy her a t-shirt don't buy her like a weird sweater unless it's like a very cool one but like it is appreciated if it's like hey I saw this dress you would look so great in it like that that's cool you're thinking about you know what your girl looks good in you're thinking about like oh I want to see her in this this is really pretty maybe it's like oh I'll take you on a date and you're gonna wear that like that's thoughtful but like don't just buy her like a t-shirt don't do that guys stop it what is this cool girl gifts under 50 let's go here's the overview I got a ton of stuff linked let's see the Deep dive she's doing the same panty baggy products maybe that's really in right now am I just like out of reusable back don't buy somebody reusable grocery bags go to Trader Joe's and get them for 99 cents or however much they are now don't that's not a Christmas gift that's not next up we have these plant hanging disco balls and I think they speak for themselves multiple ones with plants that's the thing put the plants in them if you get like oh those are cute if you were gonna like hang them and give them to somebody but the make finish the gift you don't don't give a half-baked thing you don't give somebody a half baked cake this would make a great addition to any bar cart as a non-alcoholic option and you just mix it with your favorite sparkling water the way that I am obsessed with these mugs I think the chubby mugging saucer are so cute and yes they're 50.99 but I think they're totally worth it I feel like that is risky though because the puffy Pottery if you did not know is like a trend right now there's like these plates and they're really really they're like this thick and they look bubbly that is not classic it's not traditional it's very cool right now if you care about like Trends and that sort of thing if your girl cares a lot about Trends and is like very on Tick Tock when I'm shopping I will spend money on good pieces that I know I will wear forever and that's important to me it's like the coach bag that my mom gave me that has literally been between us since the 80s basically for girls there's only two categories and it's you're a cool girl or you're not and if you're a cool girl they tell you what to buy on Tick Tock and if you're not um who cares but guys the gist of it is thoughtful practicality and aesthetic because if you're getting something that is going to be like on display don't make it some weird ass ugly thing think before you buy that's basically the gist I am exhausted already and it

might use that here's the thing when I walk at night because I'm not about to be a victim I do wear a headlamp but this I think would go all over the place because my hands are all over the place like holding the dogs doing everything else I want like a floodlight ahead of me I literally look like an idiot when I walk alone at night but you know what I'm not a victim I'm strapped I've got the headlight on and I've got my very ridiculous labradoodles to protect me here's another one what is that no no okay here's the thing personalized gifts with just your picture on it girls they don't want to receive this because it is not aesthetically pleasing it probably will end up in a basket and she'll pull it out every once in a while you want something that is both useful and possibly sentimental and like fits in with the whole aesthetic it's kind of like the K Jewelers like heart things with like your initials like mixed together and that sort of thing it's been done it's not that you are not trying to be thoughtful I know that you are it has just been done too much Reagan put a special message in here and she said I really hate these maybe I'm in the minority here what is this oh they're hey dudes oh my God you know what's funny the guy that sits next to Reagan at work he wears hey dudes hey dudes I got to know those when I was living in Idaho and they're a great shoe to like have by your door and like slip on my mom has a similar shoe that she keeps like outside and look oh there's an animal crisis and she like slides into them and like rushes down to the barn if you are in a like City environment if you were in Nashville if you are in like any metropolitan area they're not they're not like stylish but they are incredibly comfortable and I get it would I buy them for my brother absolutely not would I buy them for really anybody in my life I don't think so maybe by bomb but I think that's literally it here we go what is this this is actually very useful see this is like a funny gag gift but also it would help you so I don't really see a problem with that as long as you are getting something that goes along with it I have a friend who like spray tans all the time and she's constantly getting her tan and her white sheets and I jokingly said that I was gonna get her one of those little like Silk tanning pocket things and you put it in your bed so right after you self tan you don't get all over your sheets I would do that and then I would get her something that's like actually sweet it's like all about the balance I think okay oh this is what I need this is actually great but again I wouldn't buy this as a gift I would just see this on Amazon to buy it for myself LED beanie this actually looks a lot better than my like LED headlamp that I put on with like a flashing red light I wonder if it actually works I worry about these sometimes because I feel like they're probably sent in from China and uh I don't know if they actually last but again I wouldn't you know get that as just a regular gift it has to be combined with something okay what is this cat dad t-shirt no no that's like a white elephant Christmas office gift that's it gift giving is hard but we can avoid these I really think that's important basically what I have learned today from what Reagan has send me from what we have all watched they're weird things on the internet which is not surprising to anyone and my family has been given weird gifts sheller's mother has been given weird gifts I'm sure you all have so I want to give you some ideas because this is kind of what I'm thinking the state of the world it's you know we're not great right now A lot of people are thinking about like how do I protect my family how do I you know set myself up how do I be more self-reliant lean into that like especially if your family or your loved ones share those values like for example the my Patriot Supply in the ready-wise food boxes those are really cool and they show that you're you know you're preparing I always think knives are fun that's like very weird but my brother has given me like some very cool knives also guns like Smith and Wesson right now they lower some of their prices a lot of people are still wanting to you know buy guns for home defense and for self protection because the world is so crazy they're just a great company that also is cool that's not sponsored I just really like Smith and Wesson so hopefully guys that gives you some inspiration per usual the internet is not the greatest place to go for advice if you have any ideas of what I should get my brother put them in the comments below I think I know what I'm getting my mom I'm working on it right now it's a big gift but I'm very excited about it I think you know what it is Mom thankfully I feel like I'm basically done but put your ideas down below happy holidays guys this is the best time of the year before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribed to this Channel and ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "L47NZmD4_8I": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper so I have uh one of my viewers to thank for this segment James tweeted this at me this morning so if you guys are wondering whether I actually see your tweets yes I do I have to filter through them in a way but if you are sending me content ideas usually I can sort of find them but James sent me this tweet this is from a couple years ago but I think it's relevant to bring it back just considering where Hollywood has gone and what daily wire is doing to try to combat this because this story is genuinely disgusting and it really embodies some of the creepy dark undertones of Hollywood so we're gonna get into it but before we talk about it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring the notification Bell so that you never miss a comment section episode this whole ordeal revolves around the Powerpuff Girls I have never watched The Powerpuff Girls I never saw the original I had no idea that they even made a remake I remember that they were trying to do a live action version which actually I think I auditioned for like three years ago probably I don't know if anything ever came from that but I have never been exposed to it other than seeing people's little you know figurines of the girls but apparently the 2016 remake of the original TV show had a lot of problems and not just with audience reception that was a whole different ordeal but mainly with the people calling the shots behind the scenes so this is the tweet that was sent to me today it says friendly reminder one of the writers for this reboot self-inserted themselves into become a love interest to a child excuse me here's the man uh there he is a 30 year old adult male and here is his little character with blossom a kindergartner that's one thing about Powerpuff Girls if you did not know the Powerpuff Girls they are kindergartners who happen to have magical powers already I am disgusted here is the video that is linked to that tweet though why if I were to grade your hair I would give it the letter a and now in the spirit of Intergalactic friendship and maybe more in the future that's literally all it is it is 12 seconds but that again I have to drive it home is a kindergartner character that male character her love interest is played by a 30 year old adult male and the character itself is not another kindergartner this is not some cute little schoolyard crush it is a high schooler wanting to have something more with a kindergartner if you think that the cartoons that your kids are watching are safe you might want to think again but you know what we've been saying that for months now however that little clip was not the only instance this man was a recurring character in the show I think he was in 15 different episodes all revolving around his relationship with the kindergartner Blossom here's another scene I also wanted to give you this oh I like you do you like me too yes or no you have to say thing what are you gonna say what's your answer it's okay you could tell me your answer tomorrow okay bye tomorrow so not only does he have a crush on her but now she is having a crush on him and they are playing into that narrative now obviously when this show came out people were rightfully concerned and began complaining about it and pointing it out online saying this is very uncomfortable this is very weird and the most egregious part of this entire situation is that Cartoon Network is obviously aware of this they are so aware that every single video that includes this character on the official Powerpuff Girl YouTube channel that has 1.7 million subscribers has the comments turned off not even Limited completely turned off and when you look something up in the YouTube search bar concerning Blossom and this character some of the scenes that are really notorious barely anything comes up the only videos that you can find are these official Cartoon Network ones where you kind of have to search for the individual scenes and Cartoon Network has not done anything to address or fix the problem other than remove people's ability to voice their opinions on the subject there was one instance however where apparently a scene that involved this character that was very weird was removed from the show but I think that happened before it even aired like that happened in pre-production but people thought that this was so pedophilic in nature that many countries chose not to air these episodes with this character because it was so gross however all of this being said the theory was sort of debunked in 2017 by a Powerpuff storyboard artist named Grace Kraft this is a well-documented thread on Twitter people were reposting it a lot in the thread that I was reading so I wanted to touch on it she says I mean as somebody who worked on the show I know that that wasn't the intention when the character was first created the artist thought it would be funny to model a nerdy love interest after him and then because of that figured that it was fitting for him to do the voice acting plus PPG crew loved sticking in crew members as cameos in general some smaller roles some bigger roles I can see why folks see this one as a poor choice but I figured I would give my insight from my experience on there I think that is very balanced she's not really defending it she's just trying to give context she's obviously admitting that it could be very weird but the important line there is at the end I can see why folks would see this as a poor choice why didn't anybody else notice that it was a poor choice Jake Goldman who was the one who played this character whose name is Jared Shapiro no relation to us Jake Goldman who is the writer and the voice actor who the character was based on has allegedly gone on record saying no I did not self-insert into this narrative and he has basically been backing up gracecraft's claims and said that he felt uncomfortable around the whole thing he didn't really know if he wanted to do it it's like dude if you had the inkling that maybe this would be pedophilic why would you agree to do it if you were uncomfortable and obviously when you are in a work environment you kind of want to you know be a team player support people but when it comes to something like that you kind of have to draw the line in the sand you were still a 30 year old man playing a teenage character that is interested in the kindergartner on that note this reply on the original thread that I was reading cracked me up it was like we got him we got him it was the FBI yeah this feels like the Twitter version of Catch a Predator in a way even if this guy didn't really intend to do it this person said if this was actually not a self-insert and was just someone putting in the writer without his consent or awareness then while I still hate the show and most people behind it I do feel bad for the writer who didn't want them to do this unless he didn't mind in the end first of all how do you put a writer in without his consent or awareness he literally voiced the character what a bunch of hippie dippy baloney he was very aware he was doing that scene he was giving the flowers to the kindergartner somebody replied and said it was debunked as a self-insert and was proven to be an inside joke with the crew but he is still voiced the character and has been in every episode he was part of the writing team for he could have done something about it and nobody had any self-awareness yes because Hollywood is full of creeps if this is their mild inside joke that got on air that made the cut I don't want to know what their other inside jokes are because they're probably grotesque especially because one of their storyboard artists was literally fired for having pedophile Tendencies for being a what we would call in 2022 a minor attracted person literally so this person's name is Julia vickerman and somebody on Twitter posted a screenshot from her Tumblr blog way back when I think before she got fired where you can see some of these pedophilic Tendencies she's talking here about going to a carnival in Griffith Park it is a big famous Park in LA and she's talking about going with somebody named Tony they're standing in line for a ride and she goes oh but Tumblr guess who was in line to go on the Sizzler with us this beautiful androgynous long black-haired emo 14 year old boy wearing tight black pants and a black T-shirt emblazoned with the name of some band that probably sucks and his lip injected red fake hair mother who looks like a washed up rock star Oh Heaven adopt me occasionally I get instantaneous infatuations with strangers that can only be described as overwhelming or annoying depending on how patient you are with me Tony was nice enough to follow this poor boy around the small cargo with me as I tried to sneak photos none of which turned out well I knew that my heart would forever be in turmoil unless I at least tried to talk to him oh God if only his mom hadn't been there this adult woman who is a storyboard artist on a children's TV show is following an androgynous attractive 14 year old boy around a carnival trying to sneak pictures of him wishing that his mother was not there I'd say that's pretty pedophilic if you ask me she continues on the light of heavenly inspiration Shone down on me when I realized we had two tickets left which leave zero options as far as rides the two tickets had to be disposed of perhaps into the hands of an awkward skinny jean adolescent Hot Topic customer I marched over to the rock star mom and her Elven boy sitting cross-legged on the grass eating a candied apple I bent down to give her the tickets I'm creepy but I'm not that creepy I'm not going to talk to her son while she's there saying we have two extra blah blah blah blah where's your car so I can follow you home blah blah sorry what you just said you wanted to follow them home anyway then she continues on and apparently the mom says that she's really nice and said that I was so sweet Etc and I watched I watched my muse push his dyed black hair behind his ear exposing epic eyebrows Apple still pressed to his lips say thank you and smile if this was the best day ever why am I so creepy hashtag awful hashtag pedophile hashtag gpoy that was from April 17 2010. Hollywood is literally the most disgusting place on Earth it makes my skin crawl that was a storyboard artist on Powerpuff Girls She Wrote This six years before the show was premiered and they still hired her to work on a children's show unsurprisingly actually this storyboard artist is the person to blame for the infamous twerking scene in this Powerpuff Girls remake I have it here over at your eyes if you don't want to see kindergartners twerking they're also supposed to be on drugs in this episode [Music] I mean obviously one could look at that scene and just not think about it and go oh okay I guess they're dancing but when you put it in the context of everything that has gone on with this Powerpuff Girls remake with the pedophile storyboard artist with the entire writer's room having inside jokes about an adult man liking a kindergartner then it gets much more Sinister and a lot darker and I watch that two second clip of these kindergartners twerking and I want to puke hi I'm disgusted one person replied and said this whole entire thing is utterly horrifying and it says a lot about how some predators are attracted to working with children so that they can more easily assault or prey on them I'm glad she was terminated from her job and it might keep more kids safe so I won't go into details but this is absolutely true some of the weirdest and creepiest people in Hollywood are the ones who work on children's television whether that be like Amazon Prime or Disney or Nickelodeon I mean the whole Dan Schneider thing with iCarly and all of those shows that man was a predator is absolutely disgusting and creepy it's fantastic that he's not working in Hollywood anymore my own personal experience of this was when I was on a children's TV show this is probably when I was around 12 and one of the writers seemed really nice just pretty normal and I did my you know couple episodes stint on this TV show and he kept in touch and a lot of people in in Hollywood you know it is a networking industry they touch base they say hey we're working on this project what are you working on oh I might you might be a good fit for this show whatever I really thought nothing of it he usually involved my mom but it was weird that he never went through my agents and at one point he invited me and another girl who was on the show to get lunch and catch up her mom was going to be there and at one point her mom stepped out I think to take a phone call or something like that so we were walking around with this writer and immediately he launched into telling us about his lesbian fantasies involving us two 13 year old girls and then at another point he said that he wanted to take off my friend's clothing in like a very laughy jokey way he stuck his hand in her back pocket like very very weird and I was like get your hands off of her I moved out of that real quick and I felt awful for her though because I immediately called my mom and said this guy is creepy I never want to work with him again I never want to see him again I saw him at a bunch of events later on and just never interacted with him he even started doing artwork of young actors later on like would do little little mini portraits of all of these like 12 to 18 year olds and would try to deliver them to us and he had a whole Instagram dedicated to it like it was very very weird but I felt awful because my friend was so nervous that her reputation would be destroyed if she even brought it up or you know said she didn't want to work with him again and she was like well nothing really happened and I was like no a 45 year old married man told two 13 year old girls about lesbian fantasies involving them like the line has been drawn in the sand it is creepy I'm never working with you again and so that was my one experience with that sort of thing and obviously there are so many you know former Child Actors young actors who I know who I was close with who were not as fortunate to get away unscathed and who did face actual real you know physical trauma when it comes to that sort of thing and I'm incredibly grateful that I had a mother that taught me how to set boundaries and told me not to put up with that stuff that got me into self-defense classes that made sure that I always had somebody that I trusted in the room with me because other people just that was not the case for them and I just thank my mom every single day for that and my reason for sharing that personal anecdote and doing this episode about this objectively gross situation is so that I can inform you guys about the reality of what goes on behind the scenes in Hollywood and obviously not everybody is like that there are incredible creative artistic people that genuinely want to create good content especially for kids but often like this commenter said so many of those disgusting people just naturally gravitate towards working on children's content so that they have easier access to kids and kids Minds it astounds me that we have gotten to this point where so many Americans are simply okay and rolling over with this desperate need to normalize pedophilia like there used to be things that every American regardless of your political affiliation your beliefs and your values that we all agreed on and that was protecting kids and that minor attracted people that pedophiles were disgusting and deserve to be castrated apparently that's Up For Debate now in my mind it is not I'm just saying that something you can think critically about the content that your children are consuming which is just one of many reasons that I am so grateful to be working at a company that is investing so much time money and energy on creating content for children that you can trust as parents so you can send to your nieces your nephews your grandchildren your cousins whatever because it is so desperately needed and obviously I'll be talking about that a lot more in 2023 when all of those Productions start debuting and premiering but just know good things are coming and please protect your kids like draw the Line in the Sand hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "dQO_kim9c_Q": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper we are going to be talking about some girl bossing today girl bossing is one of the left's very very favorite terms it's big in the toxic feminist world it's all about girl power and putting your career before everything else there is some girl bossing happening in Italy right now and I'm using the term girl boss favorably in this sense because I really like this woman and I think you know what we're going to talk about but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection Italy has elected its first female prime minister ever that's good but none of the feminists here or in Italy are saying that this is a girl boss moment they are not happy and that is because this new prime minister she's cute she's blonde she's fun but she is also far right that's bad which is shocking I know because women can't be far right it can only be far right because we have internalized misogyny and we don't know what's good for us obviously her name is Georgia Maloney and she is in fact a badass but in classic form the left wing media is doing everything they can to rip her apart and roast her which I think is ridiculous because the only thing I want to roast is my good Rancher steak and that's because when you slap that down on the grill you know that you are grilling with the highest quality meat possible all good Rancher steak is either USDA prime or upper Choice beef it is pasture-raised grass-fed their chicken has no added hormones or antibiotics and their fish is caught fresh and flash frozen so that when it is delivered directly to your door you are getting the freshest meat possible poor quality meat can carry bacteria which is why so much meat gets recalled at grocery stores but that has never been a problem with good ranchers they have a 100 satisfaction guarantee they have never had to recall any of their products whatsoever so you know that you are in good hands if you want to try

less enticing and delicious roasting because I hate that they are doing this to Georgia Maloney this post was just ridiculous Jerry news if you follow them on Instagram you know a lot of people get their news from Jerry news hence the name they said world news far right Victory September 26th Georgia Maloney is set to win Italy's election becoming the nation's first woman Premiere and its most right-wing leader since Mussolini Mussolini if you've ever read anything about history you know that this is just an absurd absurd comparison their caption was not better they said far right candidate Georgia melania's claimed victory in Italy's election projections show that her brothers of Italy party will receive about 26 percent of the vote the most of any party she will be the nation's first woman Premier and its most right-wing leader since Benito Mussolini while they really had to bring it home with that I loved that the comments immediately call them other though this person said Italy win media L another person said what a misleading headline another person said LOL far right nowadays simply means not a socialist accurate literally true if you sway from the narrative just a smidge far right I saw this tweet earlier it was people saying like Georgia Maloney far right American Libertarians the authoritarian fascist uh like center right fascist it was basically just going through a list of people who are not authoritarians whatsoever but who are called fascists by the far left not even the far left just by The Establishment left-wing media you are oh four six Popeye you know that means you suck and they are apparently calling her Benito Mussolini 2.0 because she is pro-freedom pro family and has spent the last two years as the primary Italian politicians fighting against coveted mandates and vaccine passports that does not sound very authoritarian to me at all trying to give people medical freedom wow she's basically a dictator Politico Europe also tried to spin their story but this one was kind of weird because it was almost like they were trying to please both sides and they really made nobody happy with the story in 1992 a 15 year old school girl went to join her local branch of the far right youth front in Rome the all-male group of radicals met her with bemusement 30 years later George Maloney is on course to become Italy's first prime minister and then they have a less than flattering photo of her and then the article is called how Georgia Maloney thinks like that first part is just so odd it's like wow look at this precious story of this little girl becoming a fascist you keep using the horde I don't think it means what you think it means and nobody liked it like the comments really were what got me because I can't believe that we live amongst these types of people this person said unironically this is why we need a ban on conservative far-right and fascist parties none of this liberal accepting and reasoning with them until they inevitably decide to take over entirely I don't think I've ever seen any liberal accepting and reasoning these days you're calling for bands on our parties let's fight authoritarianism with more authoritarianism and you know people on the very very far right I hate using that term it's just been made very ridiculous but there are people on the right that are a lot more authoritarianism and populist than I am we don't need to ban ways of thinking that's just absurd and it's immoral somebody else said oh that's adorable more stories on how little Nazis were indoctrinated please great so now they're calling her a Nazi which is unsurprising especially because they're already making memes of her where they're taking screenshots of her raising up her hand and they're stopping it right in the middle and going look at her look at her she's doing she's doing the Hitler thing I would show you guys but I don't want anybody else to screenshot me doing it which is apparently something I have to think about online these days which is ridiculous somebody else said can't wait to see what girl boss atrocities she commits and somebody else said girl boss at ease okay another person said guess I won't be vacationing in Italy for a while joke's on you I'm going in November I'm even more excited now maybe I'll go meet her I actually would adore that but the weirdest part of all of this is all the people commenting in the news publication saying how could you do this to Italy like how could they let this happen this is so awful she's climbing to power y'all she got elected 26 percent of the population voted for her party the way that their system is set up they have voted in favor she did not murder and climb her way into some sort of dictatorship she was elected like does this look like she has just forced her way into power I don't think so look at her people seem very happy I love it and they are clearly very excited because they have a leader that is going to fight for them and their family and for freedom and their values again they elected this I love this Jimmy feeler comment he said speaking as an American the most shocking thing about Italy's election is they counted all the votes in one day let's go that's tough that's really tough the Soviet tweeted and said feminists it's time for women to have a turn Italy elects Georgia Maloney feminists no not like that yeah there's a lot of uh anti-woman stuff going on right now coming from the feminists coming from the people who claim that women are oppressed ironic per usual now that you have seen the internet's quite hostile reaction to George's win let's see how radical she really is just so you know it is in Italian so you're gonna have to read Subs sorry putting you to work but here we go foreign foreign it is so obvious that she did not have to do any dictator Behavior to get to where she is she is compelling she is smart she is so quick she was barely looking down at all that was a fiery and Incredibly compelling speech but it was also very simple which I think is why it works because she's speaking directly to people who feel like they have been erased that their values have been erased the things that are important to them are no longer important and are shunned by The Establishment by Elites by the media by this radical one percent that has even made its way to Italy because it's really infiltrating every aspect of Western Civilization she's speaking directly to them and saying you are important your values are important to the things that define you undeniably are important and everything stems from there we shouldn't have to walk around you know defining ourselves as numbers or you know latinx citizen X whatever to be a cog in this government's machine like we are so much more than that and that is why she won hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "ltXUrojZ0mM": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper i i can't even believe i'm beginning to say this but card games are political now which i just said that i can't believe that i'm saying that but basically

back to cards against humanity so this tweet went viral from a woman named colleen and she says cards against humanity is donating 100 of their proceeds to the national network of abortion funds if the order comes from a state restricting abortion access if somebody selects i don't agree to this an additional five dollar donation is added to their cart it has 204 000 likes and here we have the actual screenshot she put it goes cuck you live in texas a theocratic hellscape where human beings are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies by threat of imprisonment we are donating 100 of our profits from your order to the national network of abortion funds and then you can click ok and then give five dollars more will match it and then what i'm pro-life i don't agree to this so if you click that you get taken to another page and it goes so you don't want us using your money to pay for abortions you know sometimes people have values imposed upon them by bigger more powerful entities and they are forced to do things that they don't want to do like carry an unwanted pregnancy for example we just added an extra 5 donation to the national network of abortion funds to your cart they have an impeccable business model like what kind of drug are these people on like there is nobody that simps more for authoritarianism than the left it's like a drug a drug of power i mean honestly it is just mind-boggling we are living in a time where you cannot even buy a card game to play with your friends after dinner on a friday night without getting bombarded with political activism i mean every single company feels like they are doing this you know who's not though good ranchers as you all know good ranchers is my very very favorite meat delivery service and you know why their products are incredible it's because they focus on their work they focus on the meat instead of focusing on winning political brownie points and trying to do political activism they have incredible values they support american agriculture their products are 100 american-made all of the meat is born raised and harvested right here in the united states and then it is shipped directly to your door if you want

thinking about going home and cooking my good rancher's steak which is in my freezer because i only talk about sponsors that i actually use and i love good ranchers other people started replying and said i had to check because i don't believe everything online amazing here's another screenshot it says cards against humanity your state sucks oh how woody another person said here's the ordering from a broad view no time like the present to finally buy our own packs cards against humanity thanks for the fight and it says congratulations on living outside the u.s must be nice this is just especially idiotic because i don't know if you're aware but most countries outside of the united states have stricter abortion laws than we do yes even european countries so this is just a bit backwards but it's kind of classic left where they will just say anything and everybody will believe it because they are in an uproar of emotions and gaslighting and fear and anger somebody responded and had a very respectful and intelligent comment and said while i'm fairly pro-choice if you're clapping for this wait until this is turned around on something you don't agree with and see if you're happy terrible precedent to set and this person is making a much broader point that i actually wish more people would understand especially on the left and that is that when you expand government when you you know create all of this legislation when you set these precedents most people are very nearsighted and they are just trying to attack the current problem attack their enemy but what they don't realize is that once you expand government and give it that power it will inevitably come back and impact you those are the unintended consequences when you expand government when you give it that power it will hold on for dear life and in the end you are going to be paying that price as well but sadly in the current state of things people on the left don't feel like they need to fear that inevitable consequence because they have every single aspect of society on their side the media every single institution big corporations freaking card games on their side so they feel like they don't need to fear the government would ever come after them yes i am invincible newsflash it will somebody replied to this person and said it's not a precedent it's a response like okay rufus you know said response can become a precedent very very quickly things snowball in this culture right now if one company takes a political step every company around them goes oh god i've got oh i've got to catch up i've got to do this too like open your eyes this is this is not new somebody else said the founder of cards against humanity has been accused of sexual assault racism and sexism in the workplace please stop thinking this is a great company a lot of people were making similar comments and saying this is clearly just a pr stunt they're trying to get political brownie points and they're trying to cover their tracks because they have an awful history so i did a little bit of research um because this was something i had no idea about but apparently the founder of cards against humanity has rape allegations from college and then has been accused of harassment in the workplace multiple times and then a couple of years ago there was a black employee that spoke out about racism at the company and then ended up in a mental institution and the media was trying to portray it as though cards against humanity like pushed him into the mental institution or got him committed i don't really think that the two are really connected obviously maybe the stress of coming forward and dealing with all of that made the guy break a bit i really don't know but that's kind of the story the main point is cards against humanity is not all rainbows and sunshine and you know whatever they're trying to be with this whole stunt which is unsurprising because have you played their game next from jk rowling harry potter and the chamber of dead parents i say that but what was edgy six years ago when this game was very very popular is not edgy at all now like you can find those sexual innuendos and all of that swearing and all of that stuff basically in every aspect of society right now you open up tick-tock and you see it so really i think cards against humanity is just hanging on for dear life at the moment somebody else said cards against humanity has restored my faith in humanity that's a very interesting choice of words how they're literally trying to kill humanity by killing babies another person said i'm so glad i pirated their cards and printed them at a staples for a fraction of the price back in 2012 when they were still relevant another person said does anyone still play cards against humanity it was a novelty a decade ago figured it would be old news by now yeah again pr stunt how long do you think this will last a company cannot survive if they are giving 100 of their proceeds from different states to you know abortion clinics whatever that other person said the really surprising and interesting thing here is that people are still buying cars against humanity right now in the year 2022 when i want to shock people i just write what i actually think of grandma in her hallmark card i mean literally like i have already said this but cards against humanity has aged out like they were edgy and interesting in 2012 and their whole thing was shock value but the things that were shocking in 2012 are commonplace today and in addition to that cards against humanity has also been self-censoring because comedy is dead and nobody can take a damn joke anymore but over the past few years they have been quietly removing cards from deck taking out things that they thought would be offensive or racist so they've basically been killing themselves in addition to all of their pr problems now they're coming back trying to be you know the woke progressive model of activism with this abortion stuff just trying to get back on people's timeline and i'm definitely feeding into that because i'm doing an entire episode about it somebody else replied and said isn't this the same company who got fired up about the wall uh checks yep so here i had no idea about this but this is an article from the independent they bought a part of the border wall so that trump could not finish it like a card game these people what do they do they sit around making lame jokes trying to figure out how to win progressive brownie points working there must be horrendous it's interesting because yesterday i talked about jennifer lawrence's article in vogue and i think she had that quote where she said i just i just can't talk with people who aren't political but my response to that was it's 2022 who isn't political like every person every damn company card games are political i don't know what world you're living in where you think the people aren't political but you step outside and people are making political statements with the clothes that they wear the things that they say but the places they shop our entire world is hyper-politicized and polarized right now and the left especially excels at that that is why they have been winning that is why it is so important that people who have common sense who are straying from the mainstream narrative must be loud and you must be just as tactical and i mean jennifer lawrence is right you do have to be political we don't have to play their game we don't have to follow their narrative but we need to be just as smart with how we are getting our messages across hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "iHHmrxbCYgc": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper we're going to be talking about somebody today that I think people in my generation are really going to know and they're going to resonate with this if you're a little older than me you might know her you might not but we're going to be talking about bad baby aka the cash me outside how about that girl catch me outside how about that I did a segment about her a few months ago because she bought like this seven million dollar house in Florida from her only fans money man my two episodes today and tomorrow have been a lot about only fans I apologize in advance but you know what it's the world that we live in anyway she got famous on Dr Phil she became a meme for saying cash me outside she had like an awful home life and was sort of this Reckless teen from the hood like carjacking and stealing things and she turned that into internet Fame got a record deal and is now like chart topping with these rap songs then she started making a million dollars a month on only fans and then she bought a seven million house in Florida oh and she is literally 19 years old I will say though she looks a lot better than she did when she first made that appearance on Dr Phil like she's taking care of herself she probably has a skincare routine if you want to take care of your skin you need to try to make skincare nimi skincare is made right here in the United States they even Source some of their ingredients from local American Farms and their products actually work other than their effective formulas and their great values one thing that I love about nimi is that they have these pre-designed daily routine bundles that will fit your lifestyle and your needs my favorite one that I use every day is a daily glow up routine it comes with a lot of different products they even give you instructions on when to use the products how to use them in what order to put them on like it is literally foolproof which I needed because I barely understood anything about skincare when I started with nimi if you want to check them out to go to nimiskincare.com use promo code Cooper at checkout for 15 off your order again that is nimiskincare.com promo code Cooper at checkout like I said bad baby she's Rich she's been refreshed her skin is looking fantastic and now she has decided after her you know only fans moment she has decided that she is going to to enter the academic sphere so I opened up Twitter to see articles from like garbage tier tabloids like TMZ to Publications that actually have a good reputation like daily wire all talking about this here's the TMZ one because I love a good Trash Story bad baby has already proven she's all about her business and now she's been invited to drop some wisdom at Oxford University that is not a prank first of all bad baby and wisdom being in the same sentence and University also was just really a mindful for me but you know what it's 2022. truly like I said this is real life the president's the higher-ups at Oxford have formally invited bad baby to come speak at Oxford Union which is the esteemed debate Society at the University I mean it has had guests like Ronald Reagan Richard Nixon Einstein Mother Teresa the Dalai Lama the queen and now bad baby is coming to to drop some knowledge on everybody at Oxford Union I don't want to live on this planet anymore somebody said who had the cash me outside girl from Dr film speaks at Oxford University on their 2022 bingo card literally not me at all that is not even something that I could have come up with in a fever dream the other person said why is the cash me outside girl speaking at Oxford University meanwhile in the great UK the potent philosopher bad baby will speak at Oxford it's like the dichotomy of things going on right now like people are waiting in line for 13 hours to pay their respects to the queen meanwhile bad baby is about to hop on her private jet skedaddle on over to Oxford to speak her truth what is going on I'm just happy that the United States is not the only country right now that is just going through hell in a way like I'm glad that we're not alone but I have to say my opinion about bad baby laughs I can't believe I'm saying this her real name is Danielle but she goes by bad baby and every time I say it I just can't believe this is my life my opinion about bad baby has slightly been changed as I was researching this segment I always want to try to see the best and people give them the benefit of the doubt and honestly I have been impressed because there's a Twist to the story I saw this tweet somebody said hand in the air I did not have a cash me outside girl starting a scholarship fund for trade schools on my 2022 bingo card but good stuff I love the bingo card thing it's just so funny it never ceases to crack me up this is also not a prank this is real why Danielle bregoli AKA bad baby is launching a scholarship fund for trade schools this is true she is really doing this let's watch her YouTube video don't worry she has her clothes on she's not rapping like I I'm a fan of this let's watch hey so it's been a while since I made a video I've been chilling and staying out the way but I'm very proud of what I'm about to announce I'm doing something that everybody loves which is giving away a lot of money 1.7 million dollars this isn't just a giveaway like just handing out money you actually have to go to school it's a scholarship I'm here to announce bad scholarships before y'all start talking about how could you give scholarships out you didn't even go to college you didn't even finish school I didn't need to but this ain't about me this is about y'all first of all I'm 19 when would I have even had the chance to go to college maybe I will go to college probably not but anyway I've been donating money to different organizations trying to help the kids and also donating to help clean up the trouble teen industry I wanted to figure out a way to give people money not just by walking around handing out hundred dollar bills but by actually making sure that they take the money and do what they're supposed to do so instead of going to college for four years I wanted to help people who don't have the time money resources or desire to do four years of school we're giving scholarships to Accredited Online trade and technical schools I'm I'm so into this the first thought in my mind was like why is bad baby the one creating these scholarships like how did it fall on this 19 year old viral meme chick only fans model to actually make some progress like Leonardo DiCaprio throws millions of dollars a year basically into the ocean for his fake climate change stuff the Kardashians they're probably not giving any money away all these celebrities they're out there you know making tequila brands throwing money at Hillary Clinton and that sort of thing then there's bad baby out by herself in Miami helping the triple teens like it's just so wild but you know what I'm here for it at this point even though I know it's kind of absurd I kind of do want to hear what she's going to say at Oxford Union maybe that's what she's going to talk about but I don't know but literally guys this story completely changed my mind about her obviously she has a past I don't think that she has represented the most fantastic values in the last few years but clearly something has changed she is wanting to do good I love that she said she's not just going to give out handouts I also love that she is giving this money for trade schools we do not need more people going through four-year universities getting feminist dance lesbian Theory degrees this is worthless it's less than worthless my boy we need people who are supply chain managers we need people who are working in Freights we need people who are restaurant managers we need people who are hairdressers I need people who are a dog groomer people who go to trade schools and work in those Industries they keep our country running and she clearly understands that I'm so pumped about it I have no qualms whatsoever this is the scholarship page so this really is happening uh bad scholarships a new generation of leaders she also is not having like a bad baby on it she has bad as the name but in all of her quotes and the information about it she's using Danielle her real name she said I'm really excited for what you know my generation is going to do I'm very grateful that I can offer this to them very well written I know if she read it herself or somebody else did but you know still it looks professional in the comments on the video are all so positive and it kind of bums me out because her rap videos and her like less mature videos or mature in another way if that's how you think have like millions and millions of views her video about the scholarship only has like 200k and in the grand scheme of things in the grand scheme of how many subscribers she has that's really not a lot which bums me up and in her Instagram post where she first announced the scholarship which she has now deleted she really keeps like barely anything on her Instagram she even said like people are talking about how I made so much money on only fans and how I bought this big fancy house but literally nobody cares that I'm starting a scholarship but I don't care I'm going to do it anyway it's like come on guys I mean I was even guilty of this I had no idea I'm happy to promote it now somebody said I can honestly say my whole perspective has changed I'm so proud of you for doing something so genuine and letting people see you're actually human while giving back and dismissing all the doubters keep up the progress love it yes character development fantastic Round of Applause somebody said I love that they aren't the typical courses like math biomedicine whatever but business inspired courses also not like I said lesbian dance Theory influence those young entrepreneurs and athletes Danielle okay Round of Applause again and I really love this one because I think this kind of sums up my whole perspective shift about her Sarah black she says as a mom I used to say that I pray my daughter never turns out like you I was also wrong for saying so this among other things merely goes to show how much you've grown as a person I'm too old to benefit from something like this but I pray and said that it goes to people who deserve it you are a good person regardless of what people say I really don't want my future daughter making 50 million dollars a year on only fans I would hope that she makes her money doing something else but at the same time if that is how you have made your money and you are still choosing to you know give back and enrich your community that is obviously something to admire and obviously something to celebrate so I guess what we have learned here is that Brett Cooper is now a bad baby Stan and I will be watching her Oxford Union lecture when it comes out in November absolutely no doubt guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "pBteuq3-UC0": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper so if you are not on tick tock there's something that has been going on recently and that is alabama rush and rush means like rushing for sorority when girls go you do all the interviews you get bids but it is also a huge deal on tick tock every year there are different characters who are posting all of their different outfits like crying on camera like they didn't get a bid from the sorority they want like it's very dramatic it's basically like an unofficial organic reality tv show that comes out of tick tock and it's happened for the past couple of years and i thoroughly enjoy it and what i was saying about the characters is usually like these different individuals pop up that get you know millions of views and people are like oh they run into each other and it's like the crossover of the century it's literally so ridiculous but it's highly entertaining and as somebody who is in a sorority for a brief moment of time um i appreciate their stories and i think that it's funny i was a kappa delta at ucla i actually posted about this on my tick tock yesterday and i dropped out because amy coney barrett who is now a supreme court justice is an alum of kappa delta obviously not at ucla at a different school but when she was nominated to the supreme court by trump kappa delta lost its damn mind all of our sisters got pissed off at nationals for making a post on twitter supporting acb like it was just a hot mess and they sent her on this petition to get acb stripped of her kappa delta letters and then we were given this suggested script to read it rush saying you know we know the kappa delta has been in the spotlight we don't condone amy cody barrett in her you know fight against women and then our house mom at the time sent an email to the entire chapter urging us all to vote correctly and she was hoping that we would all vote for women's rights and human rights and after that i was like listen this is all going downhill i can't deal with this anymore but anyway before we get into this segment make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already because guys we hit a million subscribers and this is just the beginning it's super fun and the most exciting part of the day is that i am actually wearing a shirt from my new merch collection which dropped today it dropped this morning i'm so excited for you all to go see it if you have not checked it out you can go to dailywire.com brett to look at the store i hope you all like it and to celebrate hitting a million subscribers i'm going to be doing a giveaway where 10 of you will be chosen to come hang out with me on a zoom call you could even get featured on comment section i think it'll be super fun so you can go to the same url dailywire.com brett to enter and my favorite part about all of this is that you will find out if you've won by receiving a one-of-a-kind polaroid in the mail from me it is signed i hope you guys like them i hope you enter because i really want to meet some of you i think it'll be a really great time and just a way for me to try to say thank you to all of you because this means so much to me that you spend part of your day with me and i love doing this show and i can't believe we're at a million subscribers all right i want to move on from that because there is a sorority man in our midst this is the video that went viral as bama rush was unfolding on tiktok i think this has over 2 million almost 3 million views now and you are going to see why ootd bama rush day 1 convocation and open houses today and this is what i'm wearing so the skirt is from lulu it's the new pink edition my shoes are air force of course my shirt is from sheen it's the really really cute one that's like everything's gonna be okay and my jewelry is from all over the place um and yeah and my hair and makeup is done by yours truly so wish me luck uh so if you did not notice that is a man rushing at bama and that's why it went viral because it's a sorority man so obviously people on tik tok who are looking for some sort of progressive affirmation all jumped in and they started following this guy he seems like a nice guy i stalked him obviously the moment that i saw this video last week and he feels kind of like the college southern version of that guy dylan who blew up on tick tock who was doing like the days of girl hood if you guys have seen that video that is the sort of response that he has garnered on the internet like people were saying like babe you are the undisputed main character of bama rush i am obsessed with you exo a washed up bama greek life alum another person said i swear if you don't get into the sorority you want i am calling corporate and yes a new character for my bama reality tv series in my head i do appreciate that other people feel like this is a reality tv show maybe these are all just hbo plants at bama maybe that's really what it is i have no idea he's only posted videos about rush the video that we just watched was his first tick tock and this was just last week and in the span of one week as he's been going through a rush he started getting sponsorships the first big one was from tarte cosmetics which honestly wasn't that offensive or surprising to me because basically everybody and their mother and father wears makeup these days maybe i'm just numb to everything at this point that's probably what it is i'd have more of a reaction if it was like that time that tampax was trying to sponsor a man who was pretending to be a woman like the man doesn't even have a vagina and does not bleed so why is tampax sponsoring it that was more offensive to me [Music] do you bleed the whole advertising stuff it's so weird but you know what brand would never fall for that kind of crap nimmy skincare as you all know by now nimmy's skincare is the only anti-woken anti-cancer culture skin care brand on the market it's kind of insane that we even need to say that but in this day and age when women's cosmetics companies are routinely sponsoring and selling to fake women i guess it really is necessary but the best part of all of this is that nimmy skin care is not only aligned with my values but their products actually work i have been using them every single day for the past eight months they are incredible they source their products from local american farms they are 100 american made they have tons of different routines that you could try i personally use the daily glow up as you all know i love it and if you guys want to try nimmy skincare go to nimmyskincare.com use promo code cooper at checkout for 15 off again that is nimmyskincare.com promo code cooper and you can rest easy because they would never sponsor this type of thing uh but moving on he posted more videos hey y'all it's grant and this is my ootd for bama rush day two today is philanthropy round one so i have a skirt that i got either from amazon or shin and the shoes are from i don't know i have a diamond anklet and some random jewelry and the panhal shirt and also my makeup is again by me so wish me luck today and [Music] i will say to give him credit this guy is way more into rush than i was and looks more the part than i did every girl who is rushing a sorority wears those little like platform sandals with the elastic straps i don't make the rules but i remember when i was rushing literally everybody was wearing those and i was incredibly overwhelmed because obviously me going through sorority rush was comical to say the least he's playing the part that's the thing that's so weird to me he's playing the part of a girl rushing it's just it's strange lives if tick tock found the account and posted this video of his which then got twitter all in a firestorm today is day five of alabama rush and it is the first day of sisterhood round i'm so excited i cannot wait my dress is from hello molly thank you so much hello molly love you my like this thing is from shannon my shoes are from shannon and my ring is from graduation oh not again that is so funny and i'm laughing so hard so wish me luck today and thank you so much is it mean if i say that the more of his videos that i watch the less i like his personality sheller just called me homophobic because i said i didn't like this guy's personality i do like the game i was saying that as i watch more of these videos i progressively dislike his personality more and more i tried to go into this with an open mind saying maybe he really is just trying to find himself i'm just gonna be honest he seems a bit self-absorbed the whole like i did my makeup myself i'm so whatever i'm like yeah we know i just don't like that much attention and so maybe i'm projecting that on him i don't know obviously people went to war in that comment section because it was on libs of tick tock uh somebody said the saddest part is the woke sorority girls will no doubt allow this male to take the spot of a female in their sorority we'll see if they actually do in a bit uh but i was thinking back and my sorority definitely would have let him in i know at a couple of ucs there had been some transgender girls that had gotten accepted into sorority so that was already sort of a thing i don't know if that had happened at ucla yet but when i was there there was a whole conversation about how we weren't diverse enough and part of that was with gender and i was like this is just kind of ridiculous like a sorority is not gender diverse enough like it's for women i the whole thing is just ridiculous somebody said i feel bad for the drunk dude going back to his dorm room with this individual i feel bad for everyone in this situation like oh god please somebody else had a different perspective and said i mean it may seem weird and is not something i would do personally at least he's an adult 18 plus in an adult environment college and is not doing anything that involves sexualizes or exploits minors in any way more power to him and i hope he lives his best life this person's not totally wrong i would obviously care a lot more if this was involving preschoolers like a lot of the things that i talk about but i think we can acknowledge that he's an adult and he can make his own adult decisions while still acknowledging that this is just a weird situation i mean he posted his first video and now his instagram is blowing up his tick tock is blown up he's getting sponsorships the guy is set basically like he's going to be smooth sailing through college probably will not have to work any barista or waitress job like the rest of us did somebody else said women don't talk this way such an offense character yes because number one just putting it out there this is a biological man that's never going to change but i don't even think he's transgender like he's not transitioning this is an effeminate man who up until a couple of months ago because you can look on his social media has been wearing men's clothing identifying as a boy and is now in college suddenly wanting to wear dresses and play dress-ups he's not addressed to sexuality he has not addressed his pronouns his gender any of that like this is a boy wanting to be part of the sisterhood because he likes wearing skirts just because you get dresses from hello molly and you like wearing lululemon skirts does not make you a woman oh my god that makeup and that dress nailed it i know thank you moving on how is this different than the guys being drag queens like if you're going to play a character say that it's a character but anyway to wrap up this story after everybody has been following grant's journey for the last week he had to obviously let them know the results of rush what came out of it and he told everybody yesterday that he had been dropped which in rush means that no sorority thinks you're a good fit and you will not be getting a sorority bid bid meaning like an offer to join the sisterhood and he released this statement on instagram hey everyone it's grant first and foremost i would like to thank my family friends and everyone who has come along this journey with me from thousands of messages to meeting the funniest people i had the best time unfortunately this chapter is closed this recruitment journey is over for me being dropped from my last house this morning during primary recruitment at the university of alabama doesn't come as a surprise considering out of the almost 20 chapters i was dropped by every single one except two before day one gamma phi beta and kappa alpha theta so what he's saying is that even though there are almost 20 sororities at bama before recruitment had even started however many of them all of them except two had said we're not gonna we're not even gonna consider you probably because you are a man that's against the rules and you can't sit with us i am hopeful of a future where everyone is welcomed for just being themselves everywhere if you are going through a hard time today remember that life is too short to ponder on the things lost choose happiness and always look for the positive things throughout life move on see the good see the bad hope for the best and brave the worst i actually really like that that's positive that's a good message totally fine with that um he said looking back on the past week so many amazing opportunities have come my way i'm yeah he's now basically an influencer um in my initial application papers i paid tribute to my grandma who passed away this year with alzheimer's i know that she is so proud nana this is just the beginning xoxo g first of all i just have to say i am very sorry his grandmother died and clearly that has made a big you know impact on his life and his goals but i do need to ask the question that we were all thinking like did his grandma want him to be a sorority man like this woman could have worn the senior citizen progressive award at this rate if her like dying wish was that her grandson become a sorority woman i just don't know i don't know but maybe that's too harsh but anyway he posted this video as well to announce that he had been dropped i got a phone call this morning and i was cut it is extremely upsetting and i'm sad because i wanted to be a part of a sisterhood and more than that a community i don't even know what to say thank you for all the love and support and i love you the first thing that stood out to me is he said he was bummed because he wanted to be part of a sisterhood and then more than that a community like dude then get some female friends if you want to feel like you're part of a sisterhood because you are a man there are so you are at one of the largest public universities in the country there are so many opportunities for community that you could fit into and if you are so desperate to be part of greek life i guarantee there are independent sororities on that campus that would love to have you that are outside of the panhellenic council because panhellenic is for women like there are tons of opportunities not getting into a sorority does not mean that you are now completely devoid of community for your entire college experience it just means that these sororities are based in that they realize that there are differences between men and women and the sororities are for women and look if the independent sorority doesn't work out you can always try a frat next time because those are for boys and even though they are kind of chaotic most the guys are really sweet i'm just saying and that's probably super cringe but i was a sorority girl and i did know a bunch of them they're not as awful as people make them out to be but truly some things must be kept sacred for women i mean one of the most offensive parts of this whole gender ideology propaganda is how womanhood has been turned into a costume art like a game of dress up if you dress a certain way if you wear this makeup if you cut your hair this way oh you must be a girl no newsflash you cannot be a woman just by putting on a dress that is not how it works we are so much more than a game of dress-up it shouldn't be that hard to comprehend do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "1hD_mmofUdQ": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper in the world of youtube there are a few huge names that have been around for literally a decade on the platform i always think of mr beast and she is sadly not on the platform anymore but jenna marbles i love her to death there was actually a photo um that a fan posted with her randomly at the mall yesterday and she was literally trending on twitter about it because she is so offline that people had not seen a photo of her in literally two years we were all starved for a photo of jenna marbles i'm your biggest fan anyway i digress the other one is pewdiepie he has 111 million subscribers he's been on the platform since 2010 i believe he's a streamer super famous and the world kind of has a love-hate relationship with him and they're hating him a lot right now because of a video that he recently made so we're gonna talk about it but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode the goal should just be to get on the same level as pewdiepie i think what do you think sheller yes so that's why we're gonna be hitting the subscribe button okay so this all started when pewdiepie posted a video of him reacting to cringe content cringe tick tocks with his dog one of them was a video of a certain tick talker that has i think 2.6 million followers she's very well known she is deaf and she signs with asl now somebody pulled a clip from this video and posted it on twitter and they said this not pewdiepie making fun of a deaf woman okay and then here's the clip well then drive through and it has like the people where they stand outside and they take your order before you go up to like the window so i pull up and i roll my window down and this lady when i no i'm not listening to this look she has your crazy nails my hand so anyway what i did was i went outside and then i peed and then i pooped a little bit as well and it was crazy sorry are my nails distracting you guys so seems pretty harmless also that voice that he's doing it's a voice that he does on his channel pretty often it's the voice that he does when he's interacting with his dog if you've watched his videos you've seen it but the internet obviously doesn't care about that they don't care about the fact that he was literally just making fun of this girl's objectively ridiculous long nails like i said this girl is deaf and the internet decided to try and cancel pewdiepie for being racist and ableist obviously because two buzzwords they're gonna use anything they can to take somebody down oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] here we go again here are some of the tweets of people losing their mind over this this guy said pewdiepie is an ableist he just wanted to mock a black woman for millions of viewers for having long fingernails and speaking in her natural dialect it's only racism you know it's a good day when you can't tell if it's satire or not i can't tell if he is actually saying it's not ableist and pewdiepie is just being racist or if he's making fun of the entire situation but that's kind of where we are as a society online somebody else said so why is nobody talking about pewdiepie making fun of a deaf black woman literally everybody's talking about it everybody pewdiepie gets away with so much [\u00a0__\u00a0] because he is the poster child for incels and youtube from nazism to outright racism and ableism he has always been given a pass by his followers and sponsors it is so disgusting pewdiepie mocked a young deaf woman's voice and long nails while using dog paws to mock her using sign language we have to stop giving insipid jackasses large platforms to bully people i don't know if that person would like me very much i'm not a bully fake news pewdiepie is ableist and knew he was opening up the floodgates for his racist in-cell following he's a grown man still trying to use misogynoir for views these people are losing their minds over this it is a 30 second clip 30 seconds and they're trying to bring in nazism misogynoir no the guy is a youtuber who makes fun of people on his streams that's kind of the whole concept of doing cringe reactions that's like a very normal youtube format it's literally what i do but the thing is i know the people will be upset at me i don't really care i think pewdiepie probably also knows that it's just kind of the name of the game these people are so soft and so sensitive that they get their panties in a bunch anytime somebody reacts in a way that they don't like the girl who goes by miss may like i said she's pretty big on tick tock she was told about this video about pewdiepie's video and so she made a reaction and i actually i think it's pretty nice we're gonna watch it apparently there's a big youtuber named like pewdie whatever i don't know his name but he made like a reaction video to one of my tick tocks making fun of like my nails making fun of my signs with his dog and then like i guess at one point mocking my voice i feel like it was very weird and very unnecessary but at the same time i wasn't surprised i'm used to it it's been a big issue in the dust community i've been trying to like normalize and put it out that using nails while signing is normal like it's okay i feel like if any other hearing person was telling this story but they had long nails on but they didn't need a sign to get their point across he would have listened to the first story and maybe even had a laugh but because i had to sign to communicate and i had long nails on he like stopped the video after like two seconds didn't even listen to the story and then after that [\u00a0__\u00a0] to like make fun of me signing with his dog maybe he didn't know i was doing sign language maybe he just didn't like my long nails that's okay a lot of people don't like them that's fine they're not for you if that were the case you should have just been like oh i do not like her nails and just skip the video but instead he chose to watch the video stop it and was like oh i know there's too much and then he proceeded to like mark me doing sign language first of all i will say i think this girl seems nice she's not freaking out she's not calling to cancel pewdiepie yet she said that she wishes that he had just stopped the video said he didn't like her nails and moved on that's basically what he did and then he said oh this girl has long nails like my dog does did a little dance and then moved on that's literally what happened he didn't sit there and talk about how a deaf girl should not have long nails if a girl has long nails and even if she's not signing i guarantee her hands are gonna be up telling her story and that is just as annoying i just don't see the appeal they're very impractical they make a lot of noise this is literally as long as i can go before they irritate me so that's my truth anyway we're gonna keep going so these people was calling him out after he posted it he went back and removed my clip he didn't remove it but he put like a sound over it so you couldn't see what he was saying about me which i feel like made the situation worse you really could have just like addressing be like my bad i didn't know she was signing i just didn't like the nails and we really would have been fine but no you decided to like go back edit it out and sweep it under the rug like nothing happened baby it don't work like that over here if you made a mistake i miss a mistake you don't just get to like mock deaf people who have already been struggling for a year with people like you and then like go about your day like nothing happened but i mean we all live and learn if he did not know before he definitely knows now see again i think she left it on a positive note at the end we live and we learn that's true i don't think she's calling to cancel him i think that this video is respectful she didn't try to cancel him she didn't slam him she just explained her side of it and what she's experienced i do think it is very funny that she is trying to advocate for deaf women with long nails like that is such an interesting niche i don't know but you know also to her credit she speaks very very well if you were closing your eyes and you didn't see her signing i would not assume that she was deaf at all and so too pewdiepie's credit maybe he heard her voice saw the nails didn't even consider that it was signing i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing but i think it's credit to her because she's killing it in general i think people will take any opportunity to try and demonize pewdiepie like they will literally turn a crumb into a cake in order to take him down we'll look at this later but he literally pinned a comment and made an apology under the edited video so we didn't fully sweep it under the rug and i'm kind of glad that he didn't make some full sob story apology to the deaf community and then say he's going to dedicate you know his life to serving deaf women with long nails or whatever because you know there's a lot of beta cucks out there that would do that because they're so scared of getting canceled i do appreciate that this happens all the time it's why they call him a nazi and say that he's racist any time that they can they really just hate him and i kind of appreciate the fact that he is normally pretty unfazed thankfully some people online did have common sense like somebody said wait pewdiepie makes fun of someone's nails and you guys make it about disability and race another one pewdiepie is under fire for making fun of a girl's nails and literally nothing else to really be setting the bar low for cancellation these days yeah actually i saw a really funny meme and somebody said that you can post on twitter and say like oh i love pancakes and somebody will snap back and be like oh so you hate waffles so you're like a waffle denier it's literally how twitter works another person said pewdiepie her nails are long and gross twitter so you hate deaf people now too it's i mean it's literally absurd these people need to turn off twitter go outside touch some grass realize that they have bigger problems in their life that they need to be worrying about rather than focusing on pewdiepie being upset at some girl's nails can we please calm down it's impossible it's not that big of a deal regardless of how ridiculous all of this is like i said pewdiepie took down the video he edited that part out and then he re-uploaded it and he put this underneath the video he said hey just to clear a few things up i edited out the clip with the girl with the long nails i had no clue that she was deaf but kind of dumb of me not to realize still watching through the clip i only poked fun of her long nails the voice i did for my dog is the same voice i've given her for years yes edit and making my dog's paws move was poking at people always dancing or doing some kind of move on tick tock which is an ongoing theme in the whole video anyway honest mistake my bad like i feel like that's handled well he's acknowledging that he didn't realize that she was deaf but he's not going like oh my god i'm so sorry for being racist and ableist oh my god i'm the worst human being no he is just explaining himself which most people don't do they just roll over like a doormat and try to appease the politically correct mob any way they can so i think this was handled well i mean if you're going to somewhat apologize to this group of people you might as well do it with some kind of chill ambivalence and defend yourself if you can usually you know i would be like no dude don't delete it don't edit it out like stick it to the man whatever but like i said the girl seems nice enough and he probably thinks he did make an honest mistake and i do think that it was handled you know moderately well even though people are freaking out maybe this is a tinge of hope for the internet because the people actually involved in this situation are making it seem like it's not that big of a deal so we can all calm down do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "V-tlWnIYRu8": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brad cooper this weekend a rather disturbing video from 2018 resurfaced on the internet as an example of disney and warner media's grotesque level of child exploitation and sexual grooming sounds nice and lighthearted right this is a great way for me to start my thursday morning so this video was called the 11 year old trailblazing drag kid desmond is amazing and if you haven't heard the name annapolis getting ready for this trailblazing 11 year old drag kid who rupaul is calling the future and bravery is inspiring so many we're going to talk to him in just a moment but first let's take a look at his amazing story [Music] i'm desmond i'm 11 years old and i like pizza trains and drinking root beers and it's caffeine free i also do drag and i love to put on makeup dresses and wigs and of course jewelry is necessary my full drag name is desmond is amazing i feel very happy to have a mom that accepts me it really touches me deeply that there are other children out there that he's reaching and they're listening to him i'm very proud of him i'm proud that he's found his path so early my greatest joy in this is just seeing desmond happy it just feels amazing to know that people love what i do my one big message would be three words be yourself always [Applause] please welcome desmond annapolis aka desmond is amazing [Applause] why are all these people just cheering it's creepy this kid looks drugged [Applause] are we not going to talk about the fact that this is a room full of adults standing around cheering as an 11 year old boy now now nothing that he was doing was inherently like sexual but the whole drag queen culture and what a drag queen is is sexual in nature they're all sitting around this is not like some little girl doing a ballet dance recital it's okay it's just weird these people all need to be ashamed of themselves thanks for being here i love that you love root beer caffeine free i can get on board with that my mom doesn't like me drinking caffeine apparently caffeine is a no-no but dressing up as a woman perfect jasmine you're one of the youngest and first drag queen slash kids [Applause] young adults who look up to you for being who you are what are some of the notes you've gotten some of the notes i've gotten are like that you inspire me very much and i wish i could have had the support that you have um when i was a child and your parents we saw your parents in the piece that we did your parents are so supportive of you but they've also they've encouraged you to stay and be who you are so how has that inspired you to be open about addressing the dream they support me by letting me do what i want to do and let me dress up some people have criticized you what do you say to them it's fine um well we're all excited to have desmond here so thank you desmond but we also have some people that wanted to come see you personally so please welcome head of lettuce [Applause] getting the big guns in [Applause] edwards [Applause] can you imagine getting tickets to go see good morning america and you think you're just gonna you know see some casual thing and then suddenly you're some old boomer being bombarded with drag queens just funny these people seem to be enjoying it this lady in the front row with her like little striped scarf she has not stopped smiling the entire time she's like so for you three when you when you see desmond what comes to mind what do you think about inspirational brave courageous i wish because i started uh doing drag at 15 years old and obviously not 11 but i wish even at that age that i could have had the courage that you have to do what you do this isn't the kid being courageous they're giving him you know accolades for you know being so brave and accepting himself no like what's really happening is the parents are giving him props and costumes and orchestrating all of this weird crap that they have going on and i think it's also awesome that you are blessed with parents that love and support you unconditionally [Applause] i was given some hope by the comments on that video someone said that one black guy in the crowd that didn't clap deserves a key to the city i didn't see him i should go back and try to find it i everybody in that audience just a sea of like mindless cheering there's a documentary of him where it says his mom put him in front of the tv at two years old to watch rupaul's drag show no wonder he grew up to be this way i'm telling you it's orchestrated let's see a trans kid is like a vegan cat everyone knows who's making decisions my mom doesn't like me drinking caffeine at least we know his parents are raising him right oh that's tough okay so desmond has only grown in popularity since this video came out in 2018 but he's also been in a ton of controversy with the majority of the internet calling his parents out as groomers and affirming that this whole bit is you know disgusting and honestly detrimental to his childhood so we just have to watch a few more videos this is from a live stream that he did with another drag queen this is live so this is from a question that somebody asked him do you do do do you do ketamine on the couch dude you're an idiot yes what has this world come to it's come to a world where drag kids actually exist and people do ketamine on a couch did you not just do that what what the hell i'm done goodbye so somebody on a live stream asked if this child and this adult drag queen did ketamine why are you why i mean that question is just creepy like these people are talking to him and looking at him as if he is some promiscuous adult no he he was 11 years old in that clip like obviously kids are stupid and play around and make dumb jokes but pretending to snort ketamine while he sits next to an adult drag queen like what parent is okay with that like how how does he know how to do that like i think it kind of clues you in on the environment that he's been in okay so huffpost put this video out in 2019 i was born in pride mom in the year 2007. gay pride means self-expression to me i discovered that i wanted to drag when i watched the first episode of rupaul's drag race when i was two you do not decide that you want to do drag at two years old after watching one episode you know who decides that you're weirdo parents and if you wanted to drag just start off with a little wig and some lip gloss and a little like t-shirt and a little skirt and some heels or sneakers whatever you can be addressing no matter what i've always been able to be myself because of my supporting mom and dad say hi mom that's my mom and i love her to death drag is a form of expression and being yourself and it dressing however you want and looking fierce no matter what you're wearing even if your eyeliner went down and it's like so bad um you still look fierce this reminds me of like drunk girls in the bathroom of a bar being like you still look fierce like their hair is a mess and like mascara is dripping but they're still hyping themselves up except this is 11 year old boy i need to keep driving that home anyway thank god the internet had some rationality when responding to this video most of the comments were people saying like this is weird these parents are groomers this is creepy obviously he's not doing this on his own one person said uh i'm sorry but as a bisexual woman i think this is going too far this is literally child abuse adults are taking advantage of a minor they are sexualizing a minor what the yup point blank i think that regardless of where you land on the political aisle i think you can you know look at a child in this situation and say this is wrong there are still some groomers out there with their heads in the sand this person said i am so so so confused as to why everyone is bashing this so much he's having fun he's doing it as of his own will he's exploring creativity in a safe way and expressing himself in an outward healthy manner the only way this is sexual if is if you make it that way yell or gross of his own will no he is a child he might enjoy this little dreamland fantasy world of attention that he's getting maybe he genuinely likes sparkles that's totally fine if he does but there there has to be an adult behind this that's also such a left-wing tactic that if we criticize something they immediately turn it back on you and say you are the sexualizing one you're the racist but no we are simply calling out your behavior for what it is so i mean like look at this other video this is also a couple of years ago daily wire actually uh wrote about it and a bunch of other conservative outlets covered it as well it went viral and desmond's parents proudly got the footage somebody in the audience filmed it and they posted it on his youtube i'm gonna read part of the caption his parents say here it is the performance that broke the internet in december 2018 this is the infamous brooklyn performance why the scandal well shortly after this performance the conservative media went on a bender claiming the desmond was stripping dancing on a pole and moving in a sexual manner seducing pedophiles and hanging out in a bar around alcohol was half naked and gyrating for money he was coined the bocciabazzi of brooklyn [Music] building a doll oh my god he ripped off the head oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] did you just get cash yes he did oh that's weird you guys know the whole like dance moms culture like the competitive dance stuff i want to like have full transparency and i'm big on consistency across the board i also think that that stuff is creepy like eight-year-old girls in like sparkly little bikinis gyrating and like twerking across the stage that also is weird so i'm not saying this just because it's a drag queen thing and whatever and it's lgbtq activists whatever no again across the board sexualizing children putting them on a stage half naked in front of adults filming them is freaking weird kapow truth bomb like he is wearing a crop top not just like a crop top basically a bra and people are giving him money where is the lie like i'm sorry conservative outlets they got it right like these parents his team his fans they are exploiting this child like that is as clear as i can be they are sexualizing him so like wake up

we've only been doing this for a couple of months so thank you so much for all your support and if you have not uh liked and subscribed and hit that little bell for notifications go ahead and do so now we're expanding content rapidly so make sure you are on the train the comment section train that was weird anyway guys today we are going to talk about everybody's favorite native american elizabeth warren she is one of the democrats that is obviously having a meltdown about the potential of roe v wade being overturned she was so triggered that she decided to host an impromptu riot pep rally is the best way that i would describe it in front of the supreme court and i just kind of want to go through all the videos of that event and what happened because it's really just kind of priceless my name is elizabeth warren and i'm madder than hell strong very powerful just on that eight second clip somebody says thank you elizabeth warren weirdly comforting to know that others have rage headaches too oh you people what do you mean you people so anyway then she gets into her full little spiel she posted this video and said i am angry because an extremist supreme court thinks that they can impose their extremist views on all of the women of this country and they are wrong i have seen the world where abortion is illegal we are not going back not now not ever big mistake big huge okay liz yeah they're using this inflammatory very vague language so that they can come in and start doing their whole let's pack the court thing again [Applause] i am angry because an extremist united states supreme court thinks that they can impose their extremist views on all of the women of this country and they are wrong it's a base legislative caption because we have reached the culmination of what republicans have been fighting for angling for for decades now and we are gonna fight back uh overturning roe v wade being pro-life is not just a republican issue i filmed a bunch of videos actually at the march for life in i think it was in late january or february of this year i was there doing some daily wire stuff and there was a huge collection of pro-life democrats of pro-life progressives they were out there like saging doing dances it was a whole thing they were like dancing with like the catholic nuns that were there i'm telling you the pro-life community is one of the most uplifting and positive ones that you will ever encounter that's just a side note so this is not just some right-wing extreme agenda that we have it's a moral issue not a political issue okay moving on i am angry because of who will pay the price for this it will not be wealthy women wealthy women can get on an airplane they can fly to another state they can fly to another country they can get the protection they need this will fall on the poorest women this who have been abused who are victims of incest this will fall on those who have been raped also it's important to point out here just a this is an argumentative or logical fallacy she's arguing based on the exception rather than the rule and she's using this very small percentage of women who experience incest who are raped as the scapegoat basically to argue for abortion when in reality 96 to 99 of abortions are done out of convenience because people want to evade responsibility it is used as a form of birth control and then that four to one percent is you know the rape the incest um the health of the mother therapeutic medical reasons when any pro-choicer uses that argument they are just exploiting those numbers this will fall on mothers who are already struggling to work three jobs to be able to support the children they have well i am here because i am angry we know she's happy and here because the united states congress can change all of this [Applause] this feels like a campaign speech understand this i have seen the world where abortion is illegal and we are not going back [Applause] if roe v wade is overturned abortion does not become illegal it is sent back to the states and the states will decide new york california all of the blue states you will be just fine someone comments what concrete steps will you be taking to codify row into law as soon as possible senator yeah this literally feels like her like i'm committed congress will change it it feels like a campaign speech somebody pointed that out and said she will spam you multiple times a day with unnaturally chipper texts written in the first person asking whether she can count on you to pitch in 15 someone says this is a women's issue only women judges should decide only women legislators should get to introduce bills only women should get to vote oh real original now i know the left hates when we bring this up but this is also a men's issue a man is involved in the creation of a child therefore the man is part of this conversation also women are overwhelmingly pro-life we need more men in the pro-life movement so this whole thing of like if we get men out of this conversation robe will be credified into law no actually like more women are pro-life than pro-choice overwhelmingly so there was another part of this little speech that i think she tactfully cut out of that original video where people are basically saying that she's calling for an insurrection for decades now and we are gonna fight back i think i mentioned this yesterday but this feels like the beginning of another summer of love except instead of burning and looting buildings we're just gonna see a lot of angry feminists walking around in crappy handmaid's tale outfits someone says this poor woman is suffering from hysteria she needs to rest and fresh air to realign her humors damn these native americans sure are intense oh no comment but you know to be fair liz good old liz is not the only one who's calling for war basically uh libs of tick tock did a little compilation this is different than the one i looked at yesterday uh this is the people calling for violence oh yeah if they actually do this yeah that would be the time where rioting would be okay i got the pitchforks you get the gas and the torches let's do that because uh uh this man is on some drugs no no what i got from that video is that this man is just afraid that his endless string of hookups is going to result in him having to take responsibility for a child one day yes actually there's only one solution to this to all of this because it's all interconnected starts with v ends with e and it's not vote violence i i don't know why i was like so excited that i got that right apparently like violence and rioting is only okay when it's their cause you know when they burn down buildings it's fine it's out of love someone says tell me when the scary ones appear this group is cupcakes uh i'm in an open carry state i'll be fine yeah same it's good to see that the written house protesters have found a new calling that was good that was good yeah i'm really not afraid of pro-choice protesters to be quite honest i think i'll be just fine anyway this last clip from liz you know she gave her a little spiel and she's old guys she's a native american elder it took a lot out of her to do that speech and so you have to see her walk away i am angry angry and upset and determined the united states congress the finger these rovers swayed the law of the land they just need to do it i've never seen you so angry you seem to be this is what the republicans have been working toward this day she keeps saying that she keeps saying it they have been out there plotting carefully cultivating these supreme court justices so they could have a majority on the bench anyway somebody says and perhaps the plants are identifying as a concrete sidewalk today one says sounds like [\u00a0__\u00a0] warren is on the warp path oh the native american jokes really just don't get old i can say that because like liz i too am like one sixteenth native american so don't get me with that somewhere on my lineage there is but i'm not actually listening all the democrats are just going crazy to be honest all the dc democrats they they're pinning this all on republicans even though it is not just a you know conservative issue we don't really know who leaked it why it was done i think it was planned the midterms are coming up this obviously is you know intended to incite something but they're all losing their mind like obama released some like six paragraph statement about everything that was like the most beta thing i've ever read biden is you know spewing some nonsense and kamala did a speech that's actually worth watching where she really used a lot of like greta thunder uh rhetoric how dare they they're going crazy they're triggered they're spiraling it's a great day for me i'm really enjoying it so go to twitter if you want a good laugh we have to stay uplifted during these times and this is just the beginning of this roe v wade stuff we've got more to come so get excited hey guys we're adding new comment section content every day so make sure you like subscribe and ring that bell so you don't miss a single video", "d79V64l6Y9E": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper so when i woke up this morning and i checked twitter like i normally do the first tweet that i saw was an incredibly unfunny woke virtue signaling tweet which actually now that i think about it is probably 99 of the tweets on that platform but we're gonna talk about it because it is perfect comment section content but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification bell and of course go to dailywire.com brett if you want to check out my merch collection okay so this tweet is from cbs news it says for the first time in the comedy skit show's nearly half century history saturday night live will have an openly non-binary cast member as molly kearney joins the cast let's have a round of applause for diversity lgbtq representation whatever they're going to say so stunning so brave i literally do not care the show is basically dead at this point i used to love snl i would watch reruns as you know i did not have tv so the kind of comedy that i would watch was like i love lucy and then i would watch really old videos of ellen because i thought that she was super happy and funny and then i would watch like old snl clips and then i loved kate mckinnon at the very beginning now i think she's just kind of annoying and super political but like that was the era that i was super into snl and then now i watch it and i have a straight face the entire time i'm watching it because it is not funny at all that is not even a hot take it's just kind of a fact at this point somebody said so weird that snl has never before had a cast member who is an openly fake thing that was invented five seconds ago it's like wow the show's been running for 50 years and i can't believe they're so behind the times like no non-binary people just kind of popped up literally six months ago and demanded that they were in everything saurage tweeted and said i don't give a just please be funny again like i'm saying this is the general consensus somebody else replied and said non-binary this is a fake thing made up by over-privileged bored westerners yes it is this is what happens when capitalism lifts the world out of poverty we solve hunger we unify as a country then people find problems to rip us apart once again you can basically use this logic to explain every single thing that the left complains about at this rate another person said but comedy is binary it is either funny or not and snl is not funny so let's take a look at this girl molly kearney i was hoping that when i watched her videos i would actually be entertained because i want snl to be good i have fond memories of snl i really don't give a about your gender or your sexuality just make me laugh i want to give this person the benefit of the doubt because maybe they actually will be funny maybe they could bring some comedy to snl so i have pulled some of molly's videos and we're gonna watch these let's just take a look and see if we laugh you know what i miss the most about the real world yeah this whole quarantine thing you want to know what i miss number one thing besides you know going to the bus i really miss going through the house you have the little christmas party at the house you got all the cookies out you get there you gotta put the coat on the bed upstairs you gotta walk upstairs like a huge winter coat mostly because of the midwest we're filled with snow we look i'm gonna put the big coat on the bed let me get all the way downstairs and then we'll waste it later after drinking too much of your boxed wine cause you're too cheap to buy bottles diane i gotta lug my ass back up the stairs because you didn't have kids so you got no kids to go get my coat i'm the king-sized bed in your master bedroom in your house get a life i'm kidding diane i'll see you on tuesday for bingo did anybody laugh at that nope like i said i wanted to laugh i would love to laugh at a fake midwestern skit but i did not this is one that has 40 000 views this is her most viewed tick tock really doesn't have a ton of followers and it's her like doing a weird justin bieber deep fake impersonation i think i don't know here you got that yummy yummy baby look up here look up here you know who loves you jesus you know who else loves you look up here you're right me tickle me and scooter are about to have that drew meeting we're gonna get some new socks with the smileys and um i'm about to hit the car dealership and then i'm gonna go talk to my pastor again this didn't make me laugh it just made me feel uncomfortable but it's not really because of her it's more about me thinking about justin bieber holding hayley bieber's feet like that the whole thing again did not make me laugh but we're gonna try one more time we are cause i want to give her the benefit of the doubt let's look at her instagram [Music] that was not funny it objectively was not funny what point did that make i have no i i just i don't get it now i looked up a couple of articles about her to understand molly oh sorry non-binary them looked at like this person is clearly a girl i can't with a straight face say molly is a they molly i looked up some articles about molly to learn about molly and apparently molly is in a league of their own which is a new tv show on prime and really that's all that molly has done molly lives in l.a molly makes tick tocks that really don't get a ton of views and really are not that funny but now molly is on snl probably because molly is non-binary that was a lot but this is 100 a politicized move because snl is not woke enough i mean it is so obvious that this choice by snl was not about comedy or talent it was about their desperate need to check this non-binary box because non-binary and this gender ideology is the new thing so they have to be part of it they have to be you know on the cutting edge of vocalism so they found this non-binary person and threw him in there and i'm sure molly is maybe more funny than some random guy you might find on the street but at this rate i really don't know i truly could not care less about the gender of the people on snl or who they sleep with or what they do in their personal lives literally your only job is to make people laugh i have not laughed once and that's a problem somebody said if snl wanted to do something truly revolutionary they should strive to be funny at least once per show that would be impressive as hell yes i truly do not care about your cast work on the comedy other people think that this is long past due obviously there were so many tweets about like oh my god this is so exciting like i'm finally gonna see myself on snl it's like really all of the actors on us and i'll just play random characters i don't really think you're seeing yourself you're seeing kate mckinnon play a weird cat lady who just came down from an alien ship but somebody said i mean this with more sincerity than i can communicate through twitter i'm very excited for the first weekend the nbc snl host intentionally introduces the musical guest not with ladies and gentlemen but instead with something non-binary well guys there is a non-binary cast member so maybe molly can make that happen for you ladies gentlemens frogs frog self death self clown self billy eilish but in all of my scrolling on this thread about this story i was reminded that there has been a non-binary-ish person on snl this is not a cast member but it was a character that is very famous pat now pat was played by julia sweeney was created by julia sweeney and pat was not non-binary because obviously non-binary is a new term that was created literally two minutes ago and is now the most popular thing on planet earth but pat was just androgynous and the joke was that nobody knew what pat's gender was and it was hysterical somebody said i remember when snl had a non-binary character named pat and it was a decently funny series of skits i doubt these are coming back now no god forbid because now that they have a non-binary person they won't even be able to touch any of that gender stuff unless i'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt them maybe molly is into those kinds of skits and maybe molly will push them forward but again in this climate i highly doubt there were tons of comments people just saying what about pat i remember pat so i want to give you a little taste of pat because after watching those terribly unfunny videos you need a little bit of humor because this was in the golden age of snl [Music] [Applause] [Music] i know this is a joke but this literally looks like everybody in my generation now [Applause] what a wonderful surprise a lot of people say what's that it's pat a lot of people ask who's he or she this would never fly today [Music] here comes pat so how old are you pat 30 something i guess time's ticking away oh like a biological clock pat yeah do you have one of those or it probably doesn't matter or um maybe you could wait till you're 60 to start a family uh i mean could you well before i start a family i need a special someone [Music] well what about your lover chris since it's my birthday i'll be open with you i was in love with someone who was not what they appeared to be [Music] well and and what was it that chris appeared to be exactly a decent human being i'm sorry really earlier when i mentioned you're having a family it's just that i think you'd make a really great mo for the role model not after the childhood i had i don't know if there is enough money in the world that would get somebody to air this on national television in 2022. this isn't even the funniest thing that snl has ever done but it is hysterical to me right now because it is so real it's kind of like the quintessential if you're not laughing you're crying it's funny because it's true like i go outside in this world right now and i look around and there are so many people and i have no idea what gender they are and maybe that's because they aren't a gender they are just a genderless they them blob but like this is this is so accurate but after watching this i immediately thought about julia sweeney and what she must be thinking now because she on national television basically made fun of these androgynous people which was arguably very funny and in this current age i want to know if she is faced any flack from that if she's had to apologize and boy was i given a treat she was so disturbed by playing this controversial and problematic character that she literally had to do an entirely new tv show with showtime to make amends where she literally replayed the character of pat and apologized to a fictional character who was offended and traumatized by watching pat while she grew up like she revisited the character through a more informed gender lens and yes the plot of that tv show is as confusing as i just made it seem it is literally just an artistic apology i kind of appreciate it more than just her going on an instagram live going i'm so sorry for everything i've done but still it's the same kind of weak beta move sweeney said that work in progress which is the showtime tv show continues to give her a way to work through her feelings about having played pat she said i love what they've written i've been able to put in my own ambivalence and struggle thinking about how that character came down and what it really means and what it never meant to what it could mean it's been great which is what good art i think is it's not one thing and so it's been a great joy for me actually i would say overall but it's also weird because she has had to face the problematic past of her character pat this whole episode has just been filled to the brim with cringe to put it mildly and you know i had a sliver of hope that maybe julia sweeney would not have addressed this and that she would have been a brave comedian and said you know what no that was objectively funny i had a great time playing that character i don't care but in 2022 that apparently is just too much to expect but like basically every comedian in this modern age julia sweeney is cowardly and she is cucked and she cares more about political brownie points than she does about the actual comedy and about her art and if comedians would just start being brave and start focusing their energy on what they are actually good at maybe we could get back to having something to laugh at hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "tnmygUnZwe4": "[Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock I am back in sheller's living room which means that we are watching yet another movie that I have never seen today we are going to watch Return of the Jedi it is the last of the OT as I'm now calling it because I'm very cool and I understand Star Wars now I also learned today that it was originally supposed to be called the Revenge of the Jedi but according to George Lucas Jedi do not have Revenge because they're nice people so it's just they're returning so we're gonna watch the Jedi Return I'm very excited both scheller and Bobby Bobby's behind the camera right now have told me that this might be my favorite Star Wars yet I don't know why I don't know what that means but apparently I'm going to like it come on guys you guys know why it's probably gonna be our favorite ones we're talking about the uh the the little guys that come in in act three I think that's going to make she's going to be like oh I like this one are they cute that's Up For Debate but I certainly think you're gonna think are they like the little um you know which ones I I think get kind of a bad rap the little sand creatures the ones that would would scavenge until the jaw was yeah they're little things I I don't know what they look like underneath a little they're little like kind of cute I'm not against it for act three it'll be good yeah popcorn cool all right foreign [Music] [Music] do you guys see that video where they turned like the emperor into Jordan Peterson so yeah yeah in the Hologram from Empire that was great maybe I could be one of them for Halloween I wouldn't have to walk I could just that'd be cool roll around seems like a bad idea [Music] looks like stranger things was inspired by Star Wars definitely has elements of Star Wars oh my God I forgot he's still Frozen in Covenant somebody we should know [Music] yeah he's well in fact some people in the comments were a little mad that I didn't tell you who that was last time where did we see him before he's the one that um he was the Bounty Hunter that caught Han Solo the last one his name's Boba fetty okay his armor is a Mandalorian armor oh so there's the show the Mandalorian and the Mandalorian looks similar to him okay it looks yeah familiar [Music] no does that look player or something he's walking like a girl holy I was right how long was he in the stone stuff what did they say they didn't say but there was like a timeline in the lore I don't know six months or something okay more or less let us know in the comments below nerds ooh red let's do so exciting it's the Imperial Guard so what I told you was true from a certain point of view by the administration Leia is my sister no inside serves you well what oh I think I knew that because there are all those memes about incest gladly made remember when the French kissed in the last movie that's unfortunate so if George Lucas knew then that's weird [Music] you what's this this is the uh what's this race called the cows calamari is what they're called literally yeah they're part of the Rebellion animal Admiral Akbar it's a famous meme of him going it's a trap um he's ugly is it him or just his hair it smells like his head structure the band's back together oh ragtag Squad yeah no they have to down here on the moon of Endor they have to destroy a shield generator so they can get into the ship according to the Death Star oh they're so cute they're like cools koala's mixed with crusty white dogs looks like Rocky [Music] always so small what are these called Ewoks oh they're so cute I gotta be one of those for Halloween [Laughter] is that a thing let's see it's definitely gotta be something like chick costume oh it's Gabby Chico oh you can put a dog on it oh my God three I'm gonna dress Rocky up like any walk oh blast them off it takes them all out do you remember your mother your real mother it's a little bit that was very young do you she's just thinking about like everything it's just bagging off oh God my dad too ew then why did you kisses no too far away far away and he can feel your presence then leave this place I always knew even when I was making out with you it's a problem wow there's so many of them they are the hitch and the emperor's plan oh no Daddy walks oh no oh my God yeah what changes might that his dad has the same arm as him or whatever it's like he's sort of like what he thinks he's the right [Music] oh my God oh oh oh character [Music] I freaking knew it [Music] dude we have to look at his face Millennium Falcon really looks like a tick feels like a tick yeah [Music] to die aren't you just a little curious though we saw the back of his head and it was like really up all right way to the front of his face or more the top of his head okay space tick he's my brother you really enjoyed that Leia you weird little freak they're so cute oh that's nice why are you looking at each other like that your siblings oh that's not a sibling look that was great though George Lucas is definitely a freak so I love Ewoks is what we have determined I don't know if I would say this was my very very favorite just purely because of the Ewoks they definitely made it I will say I was getting a little sleepy until they showed up um just because I felt like I think it is important to you know cut films up into acts and like First Act and second act were very distinct and kind of separate and they kind of felt like two individual mini storylines like the Jabba the Hutt yeah the other one like two mini films yeah and everything was wrapped together in the third one so I was getting a little sleepy because I was like um and then we're back on this new planet nothing's really making sense it felt more like the first film and then it all like came together in the third act with all the fighting I wish the fighting scenes had been a little shorter because it just felt like well it was just a lot of like throwing rocks and things Oh you mean those I thought you meant like Darth Vader no no no that was great it was just the ones on that special little planet it was just kind of like okay we've been seeing you guys throw stones each other 20 minutes that I felt like could have been shortened but again they were very cute um so I would I would allow it uh but I do think it was very segmented if that's the right word it reminded me more of the first film so I do think Empire Strikes Back yes would be the second one would be my favorite one just because it felt like a very continuous story which is important to me because I like to feel like I'm being like pulled through the narrative right and the first one in this one it kind of feels like you're jumping around it but it all makes sense in the end but in the process as the viewer it's kind of like okay we're going from this to this um the end made it all worth it though um I very much like a redeeming character storyline Darth Vader fantastic I was not expecting that to happen right it's like it just did not it did not think that it was possible uh so that was great I liked it it's good it's good but I kind of I'm with you that's that's why I like Empire Strikes Back the most pacing wise yeah it's got a really good Pace it's actually it's gonna drive it's got a Relentless Pace yes and it's different from the first one like they they were like okay well we did this for the first one let's do something different I was exhausted after Empire Strikes Back exactly but then I kept wanting to watch it was like I was at the edge of my seat like yes holy crap this one it was kind of like yeah okay well I'm tired but now I understand what happens yes I have not been left wanting to know what happens next I feel like things have been wrapped up in about I know that's not the case because there's like 25 bazillion other Star Wars franchise movies and TV shows We're not gonna watch every single one of them guys no we're not this one does wrap it up nicely though it should have just ended there yes but then it's like now I have to sit through all these other hours of things and if you really want me to do it maybe it's some in some point we can do some kind of review of that I do want to move on to Lord of the Rings though which are even longer than these movies apparently so I'm so excited to fall asleep during those but I did I also was very impressed with Luke in this because it felt like he was finally grown up exactly like he starts out kind of beta in the first one God he was so annoying a whiny beta and then by this one he's a Jedi master and you buy it like Luke has like a total three-act structure yes just from his which I don't very much appreciate that yeah um Leia felt a little flat in this one I feel like Han Solo and Leia in this one are just kind of sidelined they're just there it's more about Luke which is fine yeah that's cool but like they they do a better job in the second one of like letting all the characters do things and like have predominant roles if there was one thing I was missing it was kind of wrapping up the sibling storyline just because that weird look at the end and then you know that it's like oh we kissed at one point he definitely liked her it's just the entire thing was just weird and I wish I would have I would have sat through an additional 30 minutes if she'd given a proper explanation to Han Solo if they if she had gotten you know a proper like hey this is what happened or maybe if she had also seen Darth I would have liked it if he had learned about him like having another child having a daughter and maybe that was like the thing that sparked him I just felt like there was a family story line that was hinted at but was missing until you were just left with this like pedo creepy incestuous whatever undertone this sister reveal is kind of shoehorned in there somewhat it feels like it's shoved in yeah to be a means to an end like oh your sister whatever the very end but then the meat of all of it there are two camps of thought there are the two camps of thought that people think that George Lucas knew the like exactly what he's gonna do through the whole trilogy from the very beginning yeah I'm in the other camp where I think that he was just making this up have you seen what he looks like exactly I mean like sure he might have had certain like block points like I want this to happen and that to happen in that but like those that's a very big block points that's what I'm saying and plus if he already knew okay we're gonna make Luke and Leia brother and sister then why have them like French kisses weirdo weird and then have him like doting over her and A New Hope and all that it's weird it's just strange yeah so either he made it up uh just like as it went along or he's just weird I mean I get the other Camp of that for you know in 20 in 2022 when pedophilia is being normalized everybody in Hollywood we know is gross now that just makes more sense kind of sad and I'm not you know on everybody's favorite franchise it's just kind of where we are right now yeah um but I would maybe on my own time watch Mandalorian I have seen the movie with Rey yeah so that's that's if you saw the first one with yes that's the one that takes place after this movie and the uh that is episode seven and who's the black guy that they uh Finn Finn yes yes that's the one that in the Middle East and in China they made him very small yes because Disney is cucked that character had a lot of promise and they just totally threw all that away in the second one oh well I really liked the dynamic between he and Ray and I like what happened next I don't really remember it probably because I had not watched these films so it made no sense to me whatsoever but I remember thinking Ray was a badass and I had like six friends b-ray for Halloween that year right and I wasn't because I'm not basic Jabba the Hutt not Java Java Java yeah I was thinking about coffee sorry um he's just as gross as I remembered I don't think I've seen this I feel like I've seen the part with him but I don't remember any other ass I don't remember the Ewoks out of sight out of mind but I distinctively know Jabba and for some reason I thought that he was in a New Hope right in that whole like bar scene where they first talked on you might have actually seen like a scene from the special edition of the of A New Hope because he's actually in that they like add him in okay then that's what that's probably all I know right because I've never seen any of this uh he is disgusting he feels like a manifestation of a lot of disgusting people in our world right now he's basically like the Star Wars version of Harvey Weinstein yeah I was about to say oh [Music] that's nasty but honestly it's quiet on brand um yeah just absolutely filthy yeah as creepy as George Lucas is he found a way very intelligently to make some nice metaphors and touch on some interesting relationships maybe hinting at people in Hollywood I don't know even though he's himself apparently nasty hot tanks there's just a lot of gross filth stuff under the surface does not take away from the film just letting everybody know but I thoroughly enjoyed this experience good I'm glad we've reached the end of of our Star Wars uh Extravaganza kind of sad but you know what now you get to watch Lord of the Rings Lord of the Rings I believe is going to be next what do you guys think hopefully you guys let me know if that is what you want me to watch next um I have been getting I've seen it in the Reddit page thread you guys have tweeted at me you have dm'd me after I have admitted that I have never watched Lord of the Rings probably should read it as well because I've read Hobbit I've never seen Hobbit either um that probably would take some time but maybe I could do that as my October like book thing I could read all of them I don't know how big they are how many of them are but you know I could oh Bobby's saying they're very thick they're long reads in the the you're underestimating Rose is very dense you're underestimating the speed of which I can read dense Pros okay my English major will come out anyway so that'll be next I'm very excited but thank you all for watching if there's another series you want me to do like Twilight I've never done Twilight they don't want to watch me watch Twilight but I've never seen it I've actually seen all those movies that's not that's embarrassing you have to have ammunition for when like you criticize them and people say you can't see anything you'll be seeing them so I actually did see them that's good I formulated my own opinion X well I guess I will also formulate my own opinion subscribe to this Channel and ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "hxFnx7623rE": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper guys it's june 2nd so that means it's freaking pride month which means that yesterday every corporation and their mother changed their profile pictures to be some variation of the rainbow flag and basically every organization and institution made a post about how they are committed to diversity and inclusion and promoting the lgbtqia community my my whole feed yeah all of my feeds yesterday were just flooded with this and often you know when june hits i just scroll i'm like you know what i can't fight this there's too much of it i just don't want to pay attention i mean there was nascar ufc did one tesla did want all of that you know what it's fine if you want to promote that that's great if you want to spend time you know talking about it that's your prerogative go for it whatever but i do have a bit of an issue about a couple of these posts but before we get into it make sure you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring that bell so you never miss a comment section episode your support means everything to us thank you for being here every day we have tons of fun what is not as fun is the fact that two branches of the military decided to make some big pride posts no it's not fun anymore not even a little bit first starting with the us marines this is the one that i saw in the morning throughout june the u.s marine corps takes hashtag pride in recognizing and honoring the contributions of our lgbtq service members we remain committed to fostering an environment free from discrimination and defend the values of treating all equally with dignity and respect now that's a fine caption whatever it's pretty typical again i'm like okay whatever now we get to the picture first of all we have this helmet it's basically ripped from the full metal jacket movie poster and then we have freaking rainbow bullets what is that what the is that like did so who sat there and was like ah this is this is the thing that we post like i i really don't care about your pride graphics and what you're doing i just want you to defend our country i actually uh texted a marine vet he's like my second dad here in nashville basically he's wonderful hi mike love you anyway he i texted him and i said how do you feel about this and he said that his initial reaction uh was just discussed and that he felt like the you know the marines were falling apart but he said that he still has faith in the marines and the servicemen but that the leadership has completely gone awry and i think that is a very good way to look at it because there are still people who enlist who are there serving who deeply care about this country who don't give a crap about this woke propaganda but the thing that we should be concerned about is the people in the pentagon in washington dc who are pushing these agendas that are making us incredibly weak on the world stage like here like is that what our generals look like now that's just a hot mess this is a meme but also it's kind of real like look at this guy does he make you feel secure would you put the future of our country and your life in his hands no i don't think so at this rate we all need to be focusing on some sort of self-reliance i'm not saying you need to be a doomsday prepper but at least take account of your life and be somewhat prepared you know a great way to be prepared is to invest in precious metals like gold and silver diversify your portfolio and the easiest way to do that is through bullying max bullion max is a direct to consumer precious metals retailer who can help you have security in times of crisis you can easily buy directly from their website and have your fully insured medals sent directly to your home to help you guys all get started i went ahead and created a special offer with them just go to bullyingmax.com cooper and you can get their silver starter kit at employee pricing this kit includes five of the most desirable silver medals and it is limited to one per household so run don't walk go to bullyingmax.com cooper and start securing your future because at the rate that the military's going i really don't know if i would continue to rely on them scott pressler said treating all equally with dignity and respect unless you choose to make a personal medical decision and are fired with no thanks for the years of service to our military now obviously he's bringing up the vaccine mandates because yes it is incredibly hypocritical for the military to be preaching on about how everybody is equal and they care about everybody and that kind of thing when they literally booted thousands of military personnel you know servicemen contractors employees all of that for making a personal health choice somebody responded thinking that they just dunked on this person saying you must be talking about when trump banned transgender people from the military how many times do we have to say that trump did not ban transgender people from the military the precedent that has been set is that you are like the peak of health all of that the only thing that trump did was say that if you are currently on hormone replacement therapy if you are currently taking meds to aid in your transition you may not be in the military that's basically leveling the playing field that's not banning transgender people that is just laying down a rule that is what everybody else has to follow i thought that it was just the marines i was like okay well one branch of the military is just like off its rocker and then i scroll a little more and i see the air force i had a fun conversation with my brother about this because um he's an air force vet but they said happy pride month we are the best hashtag usaf by leveraging our diverse backgrounds and strengths of each member of our total force we are committed to making the hashtag air force a place where all can reach their full potential hashtag pride hashtag pride month then they have celebrate pride with a rainbow salute that's at least semi better than the rainbow bullets i guess but the most important comment that i saw under this post was not you know talking about woke in the military but it was this june is national post-traumatic stress disorder awareness month why is social equity replacing the focus on suicide rates in the military and veteran community they are historically high my dad lost his battle with ptsd this is a real crisis i find this troubling so on the first day of national post-traumatic stress disorder awareness month the military that has the highest suicide rate that has the highest post-traumatic stress disorder rate from all of these veterans is deciding to talk about pride and gay love and all of that stuff rather than focusing on the people that are hurting it is the most tone-deaf performative grotesque thing i have seen i mean we already know that the government and the elites don't care about us but this is like a royal slap in the face it's not even a slap in the face it's like go for yourself we don't care so apparently the navy and the army watched and learned after the marines and the air force got ratioed online and got destroyed in their comment section so they didn't make any pride posts they also didn't talk about you know ptsd any of that they were just doing their normal stuff that's fine but i did notice that the navy still has their may is asian and pacific islanders heritage month banner up so you know come on guys just catch up with the times your world propaganda is outdated it's not may anymore you gotta keep up with the trends i guess i'll try to keep up now the army is being pretty quiet right now but they haven't always been and so i thought this is just the perfect time to bring up a very controversial commercial a recruiting commercial that they made a couple of years ago that got absolutely destroyed as well i thought we could just you know watch it and remember [Music] [Music] this is the story of a soldier who operates your nation's patriot missile defense systems it begins in california with a little girl raised by two moms already gay already gay although i had a fairly typical childhood took ballet played violin i also marched for equality i like to think i've been defending freedom from an early age when i was six years old one of my moms had an accident that left her paralyzed doctors said she might never walk again but she tapped into my family's pride to get back on her feet eventually standing at the altar to marry my other mom with such powerful role models i finished high school at the top of my class and then attended uc davis where i joined a sorority full of other strong women but as graduation approached i began feeling like i'd been handed so much in life a sorority girl stereotype sure i'd spent my life around inspiring women but what had i really achieved on my own one of my sorority sisters was studying abroad in italy another was climbing mount everest i needed my own adventures my own challenge and after meeting with an army recruiter i found it a way to prove my inner strength and maybe shatter some stereotypes along the way [Music] i'm us army corporal emma malone lord and i answered my calling that came out a year ago it got destroyed it has uh 4 million views and only 12 000 likes and they had to turn off the comments now this is not a bad little film it's kind of sweet good for her but we're talking about recruiting for our military have you seen the russian commercials for their military have you seen the chinese commercials for their military like i said they look like genetically engineered soldiers it's like fight hard die hard not like oh my god i found inner strength and shattered my sorority stereotypes we live in a crazy world and overseas things are getting intense there's a lot of turbulence there is a lot of tension and it is involving the united states and it is worrisome that our military is spending their money on pride graphics and animated short films rather than training and preparing for conflict and preparing to defend our country they are not some arm of the social justice warrior industrial complex they are not political activists literally just defend all americans and be strong enough to do that and at this rate i really don't know if you are guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "9I0Mcq4C8E0": "foreign [Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock today I am doing the Brett Cooper bracket my team has populated this bracket with all of my very favorite things and I have to pick one in each bracket I hope I'm explaining it right I've never done a sports bracket or anything like that but I've seen these types of things so I get the general gist of it I have to pick one of my favorite things it's going to be very hard I'm going to be very stressed about it anyway that's how it's gonna go and then we're gonna see at the end what my like final two things are got some really tough decisions ahead oh God all right here we go round one first off riding a horse or snowboarding um I'm trying to narrow them down based on like who I do those things with because I feel like those are things I do with people like snowboarding I learned how to snowboard so that I could do it with my brothers and it's like the thing we do together so I don't think I would want to get rid of that but also that was when we all lived on the west coast none of us live near snow anymore but we all do live in areas where we can ride horses and my brothers also ride horses except for read because a horse stepped on Reed's foot when he was like six now he refuses to get on a horse I think I'd have to pick snowboarding just because of that because I want my kids to be able to snowboard but I want horses I guess I could have a horse just not ride it because I want to be around them all right I'd pick snowboarding but I'd still own a horse and just not ride it that's fine true horse girl answer yep I need a horse all right next one eating burgers or eating steak I would keep eating steak with a burger it's like a very it's a type of beef in a way but with a steak like I made steak bites the other night which was great put that in a fun little bowl with some toppings and stuff that was really exciting it was technically still steak you can make like a a melt with a steak I can make fried steak fingers like chicken fingers we make a mistake that's a big Idaho thing you dip them in front sauce the possibilities are Limitless you just have to think about you know the big picture long-term happiness pumpkin size latte or apple cider hot take which might be surprising for you guys I would choose apple cider I would want to keep apple cider sometimes the coffee can be a little too much I already have a lot of energy and sometimes I just need something to chill and I also feel like the apple cider gets me through the entire holiday season pumpkin spice [Music] it's a Halloween thing apple cider gets me all the way through New Year's ooh it'll leave her so much I'd have to choose much Pichu obviously I'm kind of torn about this is interesting because I feel like I've hyped up Machu Picchu so much that I want to document it for you guys and be like look I'm here but I also will be in Machu Picchu so I want to you know not be working and not be making videos but I also feel like I've hyped it up so much that when I get there I'm gonna be like crying on camera why am I tearing up right now just really want to go it's gonna be great I'm gonna go for so long what's happening show Jerry boring this video yeah be like Brett's crying moving on airpods or phone oh I would have to choose phone do you guys know that airpods are bad for you the radiation from Bluetooth is actually awful for you I don't know the details of it but I've brought a couple of Articles and so I haven't used my airpods since actually I worked out in silence at the gym this morning because I forgot my corded headphones I literally worked out in silence because I refuse to put on my airpods it was fine it was just me and my thoughts the standards for Trump I would pick DeSantis I think DeSantis is younger he has the same kind of fire he has a great background I love that he has Trump's energy but I think objectively he is a more effective Communicator even though I love Trump's trolling I think it's iconic and I like that he already has this track record in Florida that is so impressive and he's really LED all of the governors in the country who are you know value freedom and so I think he has a lot to offer Trump even though I love him I think he will do best as a cultural figure and I think he's still really important but if I had to pick one I would think DeSantis just because he's younger maybe skin care or Diane's purse okay yeah so if you guys don't know the big like slouchy black purse I carry not my work purse that you see a lot the kids made one but I have this old vintage coach it's from probably the 80s I don't know my mom will correct me in the comments my mom's purse it's like the never-ending Mary Poppins bag I give it my laptop in that purse and it does not seem like a very big person I have to pick it and if I have to like clean up my diet and not eat dairy and cut out all processed sugar so my skin is clear without products so be it oh God would I be able to keep my crusty white dog no no crusty white dogs in general just next out of your life good I'm pretty rational I have to be rational am I outlawing guns for everybody or just me can I still own one or no no can I like shoot one you can't own or shoot one no more guns for you 2A does not apply for you anymore you basically live in Canada I have to pick Rocky I'm not going to get rid of my dog if I did not have a crusty white dog right now I would pick guns but because I have committed to protecting and caring for this living being for the entirety of her life I'm not gonna go whatever I'll figure out other ways to protect myself I'll surround myself with huge 2A people so that even if I'm not carrying they are and I'm fine and Rocky will bite anybody who tries to attack me studies show that keeping a ladder inside the house is more dangerous than a loaded gun that's why I own 10 guns in case some Maniac tries to sneak in a ladder round two so now they've populated into I guess the second round snowboarding or eating steaks this is hard because both of them are connected to my oldest brother because he's the one who I really snowboard with and who taught me how and he's also the one that fostered my love of steak I would keep snowboarding because I would be able to continue snowboarding with him and if I can't eat steak if I can eat lamb and like pork and that kind of stuff I will be happy I'm a big lover of araceland am chef's kiss that's totally fine with me I just need some sort of red meat basically because I believe it's very healthy it's the Pinnacle of all food as long as I have one of those that's fine and then I can celebrate with my brothers it's really important to me apple cider versus Machu Picchu Machu Picchu 100 literally that phone versus DeSantis I would pick DeSantis because I care more about the future betterment of this country rather than me being able to be on social media I'm guessing what would happen if that in that sense if I just totally got rid of my phone is that Reagan who is our coordinator here she would just have to post everything from her phone hold on a second hold on a second yeah DeSantis is like he'd be president for maybe eight years okay yeah but then that's it you still wouldn't be able to use a cell phone for the rest of your life that's fine much I don't want to talk to him happier person I'm not on social media I remember I got rid of all social media like last year and a half of high school first probably two one and a half year until like mid sophomore year of college I guess I was so happy listen all that stuff was going on in my family and it was suggested to me as just like clear out all the external noise and if I wanted to look at something or post some like something I would log on to my mom's laptop and I gave her my passwords and was like I will go and if I need to find a certain thing I'm gonna go log on to one of your browsers and go look and it was totally fine but yeah that's fine people can send me a letter straight away I would rather DeSantis run for president hopefully have that position for eight years then maybe he would do something afterwards he would continue being an important figurehead and hopefully he would push the culture forward and push this country forward in a way where more people like him run for office and start you know working in the you know government my phone is not that important to me even though I do use it so many hours of the day Diane's purse versus crusty white dog again I have to pick Krusty white dog because I have one I think my mom would understand if I had to get rid of the purse she gave me to protect because she has two crusty white dogs bugs so if I was like I really wanted this verse we're gonna have to get rid of Vinnie Anne Banks and Rocky and strip The Joy from so many people well I guess it's just in my life I can't get rid of Rocky I can't it would just be wrong my mom would understand it's fine I would just buy a new purse like I don't want to because I told that story actually on an all-axis live people were asking me about like my rings and if there's any significance and this David Yurman one I got when we hit a million subscribers and I told the story that I really don't like buying designer things I have this Tiffany necklace and you know a couple of things but like I've never bought a really nice bag before I'm not really into that kind of stuff it just feels very foreign to me it's like why should I be spending my money on that but you know what if I had to keep Rocky I would go out and I'd get a new bag probably wouldn't be anything crazy it'd probably just be another Coach bag because I think they're all classic or I would just find another vintage one on eBay I would not give up Rocky can be between DeSantis and crusty white dogs three no uncomplicated snow Machu Picchu shower run Point as this was all being populated that I chose Machu Picchu which is something I said I'd probably go maybe once possibly twice you know I'd be there for a week and I but I would give up apple cider for the rest of my life I really really want that experience but now we're comparing it with snowboarding again I have to choose snowboarding not because I just like love the sport so much but because it is something that my brothers and I do my mom hates the cold she hates the snow I don't know why she moved to Idaho because she hates being in the cold but she hauled us all up there in that huge 1999 Suburban to go snowboarding every single year and got me in these classes so that I could have something to do with my brothers because they are so much older than me and we really didn't have like hobbies that were aligned and were very different and so she wanted us to have that thing to do together and I don't really want to give that up so sadly I think I would give up Machu Picchu for snowboarding because I would be going snowboarding for the rest of my life hopefully with my kids who have my brother's kids that kind of stuff then that's important to me the sand is foreign this is the future of the country we're talking about here the Rocky you must put all personal feelings aside no I can't see now this is where I have to this is actually a moral decision here so in philosophy like when you're evaluating moral theory people will argue that something is moral if it benefits the greater good but that takes like your individuality out of the question I would argue that getting rid of rock like what would happen to Rocky would you just go I would not be able to I would not feel comfortable just getting rid of a life obviously I mean I'm not saying I don't have to like ring her neck and get rid of her but if I had to give her away to somebody whatever no it's okay I would make it really humane my moral framework I'm not going to allow a life to be taken in exchange for the greater good it's an animal though it's the the question between your phone and DeSantis you were like pushing the country forward yeah exactly because it's a phone I'm dating my tune now the phone I'm not losing anything by that I'm not ending a life I'm not I'm not desantis's presidency is gonna have the same lifespan as Rocky no she's only three all of my little like Terrier mutts growing up they live to be like 18 to 20 years old Rocky's in it for the long haul sheller as long as you work with me Rocky's gonna be around Rocky's gonna be at my wedding one day is that exciting I have to pick Rocky I'm not gonna give up my animals somebody else stood up to the plate the scientists you deserve a break go take a nap somebody else will step up I don't know who Trump come back I'm gonna change my mind I can't do it there's limits to me deciding things based on the greater good final round all right now we have the last part of the bracket so in this last match up I don't think anybody's surprised I would pick crusty white dog which by default means my dog Rocky I will do anything for her I committed to protect her I committed to take care of her and I will do that until the end of her life hopefully that is a very long time so she continues to torment sheller for years and years to come [Music] and I think my brother would understand we haven't gone for the last year and a half sadly I think we're planning on going this December but you know what he has three dogs who he would do anything for and I think if I asked him he would also choose his dogs over snowboarding and I think that's okay and you know what if it comes to this if it comes that the dogs or snowboarding we can work to find a new hobby to do together obviously I might not have the same history same Nostalgia of growing up but you know what I gotta do it for Rocky and I gotta do a torment sheller before you go make sure

sports adjacent work today we're not talking about sports we are talking about a former basketball player you guys probably know him he's a household name Dwayne Wade now Dwayne Wade is a former Miami Heat basketball player and he is married to Gabrielle Union and he has been thrown into the news due to a court case coming from his ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children she claims that Dwyane Wade is using their son for financial gain sorry but he is using their transgender daughter for financial gain but before we get into this make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection alrighty so for reference this is ziya and Siobhan happy smiling all the normal mother son daughter whatever things now Zaya came out as transgender at 12 years old in 2019 and since then has absolutely catapulted to Fame in the modeling and influencer world has done Runway shows is modeled for Tiffany and Co and Dove and is apparently now in talks with Disney I don't really know the details surrounding that if it's like an acting gig or just you know brand collaborations whatever you know how I feel about Disney like I would much rather stick with my Black Rifle sponsorship than ever work with Disney and I think that goes for all of daily

power llama coffee right here because guys we're not even close to being finished with this episode there's so much to unpack because now ziya is 15 years old and Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union are moving toward towards getting Zaya's name and gender legally changed they have filed the petition they did it in August like it's happening here they are together you will often see them on red carpets together it's kind of weird because you don't really see their other children on red carpets with them but Zaya is always very present but because they filed this petition in August Siobhan is fighting back and she has asked a judge to intervene and impose a court order that would keep this from happening until Zaya is 18. this really doesn't seem like the biggest ask because ziya is 15 years old you wait three years you can make your own adult decisions that seems pretty normal because right now Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union are having to file that petition for Zai on behalf of ziya because Zai is legally a minor so this is really not that crazy here are some of the headlines though they're really making Siobhan out to be a villain Dwyane Wade's XY files petition objecting to legally changing daughter Zia's name the fact that they also call her his just ex-wife rather than saying the mother of Dwyane Wade's child another one Dwyane Wade's ex-wife fears he is pressuring ziya into name and gender change for financial gain now this truly like I said does not sound outrageous to me like imagine being a parent and being shoved to the side while your celebrity husband and his new wife make life-changing decisions regarding your child like absolutely hell no if she is not able to have a say when it comes to name changes what happens when ziya starts undergoing surgery wanting hormone therapy going through puberty blockers like has that already happened we really have no idea now according to Daily Mail in her legal filing she said I have concerns that dwade may be pressuring our child to move forward with the name and gender change in order to capitalize on the financial opportunities that he has received from companies they continued on and said it was a response to an August petition by Wade to allow Zaya to legally change her name from Zion to Zaya and in August filing the former athlete claimed that he had a legal right to make decisions on his daughter's behalf and that he was only informing his ex-wife as a courtesy wild way that is so nice I'm sure she's very happy about that courtesy now Wayne obtained full custody of the boys when he divorced their mother in 2011. in a 2012 interview with mail online the boy's mother Siobhan detailed her Agony losing them to her ex after a four-year Court battle she believes he was only awarded custody because of his money and fame quote I think influence had a lot to do with it the celebrity had a lot to do with it money had a lot to do with it she said at the time now obviously I know firsthand divorce and coming from a broken family is hard enough but I mean this is another level especially when there's so much Fame and so much money involved and especially with children and being in a custody battle I've been through it it's not very fun so I don't want to speak to what is happening behind closed doors but all of this you know just strikes me as very odd and it's just so so public and it's been going on for a long time because the mother has been public about being out of their lives since 2012. now Dwayne and Gabrielle are currently on a trip to Africa right now they are doing some ceremonies getting names changed of their own I'm not really sure they're doing some stuff so they're handling this court filing from afar but this was Dwayne's response on Instagram that he posted earlier this morning he said I have decided to personally respond to the many allegations that are being made about me and my family this is long hang in there it's a classic celebrity Notes app rant here we go since this must be the new way of parenting I guess I have to address these allegations here which is a damn shame while I am on a life-changing trip in our motherland Africa I have received a social media post about me forcing her 15 year old child to be somebody that she's not and to do something against her will these are serious and harmful allegations that have hurt our children while none of us are surprised by Siobhan's attempt to fight ziya's identity and her unwavering attempt to drag my name through the mud I'm very disappointed that she continuously finds ways to Center herself and her needs without regard to her children this report came out while Zaya was in class this is a kid who has maintained a 4.0 GPA in honors classes while navigating all of this unsolicited and harmful attention and debates about her gender and sexuality from those who are committed to not listening to her much less even knowing her first of all I'm glad the kid's doing well in school that is a rarity these days but I want to just hone in on this getting unsolicited and harmful attention you are putting your child out there publicly I'm not sure whether it's Zaya's decision or not but if you actually wanted to Shield this child from this attention you wouldn't be help get modeling gigs you would not be putting xaya on red carpets you would not be leaving your other kids at home and putting xaya in the center that strikes me as a bit weird if you really cared about the unsolicited attention you would be doing something else now we're not done yet two more slides Siobhan tried a similar attempt over a decade ago with equally damaging lies and causing irreparable harm to her children and 13 lawyers later I was awarded sole custody of our two kids as an active NBA player all I ever wanted was to have my parenting time uninterrupted as I knew it would be a very difficult time for our kids to navigate their new normal so instead of actually trying to co-parent over the year she has left her home to see more lawyers and has taken the time to talk to more lawyers since I filed for divorce then she's left her home to actually see or have truly spoken and listened to ziya over all of these years I've given her the opportunity to reach out to zias teachers doctors and therapists over the years and even meet her friends so she could get her own understanding of our child's needs for her life she won't do it she has not been to a school recital graduation school dance play date practice parent teacher conference Etc and ziya has given her every opportunity to try to get to know her she won't do it as a woman who claims to be a quote good Christian mother I have yet to see her make any sacrifice or effort to leave her own home to participate in her children's lives in over a decade zai is not the same three year old child anymore and she is screaming that to the world but most importantly to her mother no one in our house would ever forsy or any of our children to do anything against their will much less Force an identity on them this is not a game for my family and definitely not for Zaya this is her life all the while my wife and our village have been her Rock and helping her pick up the pieces after heartbreak after heartbreak Siobhan has decided to be pretty much an absent parent desire all on her own as men we get a bad rep for not showing up and being absentee fathers well that's not the case here because I'm 10 toes down and I'm still going through the I will not sit on my hands this time and allow her to make a mockery of my dedication to my family the high road is run out of real estate my lawyer will be in contact and best of luck to the 14th liar as they try to unravel this book of lies that has been sold to them now there is so much to unpack here and I'm really not gonna try because like I said earlier we really do not know what goes on behind closed doors ever the family relationships are so complicated especially between divorced people and the kids just get dragged through it but the main point here is that I do not believe that Trayvon is transphobic she is doing what she has to do in order to exert any kind of sway in a family that she has been legally pushed out of I mean maybe she is trying to just have some control and say in the matter but as the child's mother I believe that she has that right this is not a decision on what school is this child going to go to what what dance class are they going to do this is changing your child's gender this is putting them on the track to do irreversible damage to their body in the future I believe that a biological mother should have a say in that and you know I was trying to do some research because obviously Dwyane Wade made some very sweeping accusations here and people are very heated about Siobhan because they love Gabrielle Union they love Dwayne Wade and they really villainize Siobhan so so I'm not sure what is truth here and what is made up and on this issue specifically the internet is also very split because like I said people love Dwyane Wade and they loved his response but a lot of people have said I really don't know anything about their marriage but I agree the child should wait this is not an issue of a broken family this is an issue of protecting a child somebody commented on Tim Poole's post about this and said why can't these parents just tell their kids to wait until they're adults we tell them to wait to drink to drive to smoke to get married and have kids why not say Han I know you feel this way now but wear what you want and use a different name but wait on anything else totally agree again that is very very reasonable another person said no but for real if Dwyane Wade wasn't Dwyane Wade he would not be on board with gender reassignment ziya being trans and his support has most certainly opened up a new fan base and platform which equals more money and of course her mother looks bad for protesting and life-changing and then he goes on to say you know switch and surgery all that stuff another person said Dwyane Wade is trying to sacrifice his son to Disney I mean I have my thoughts on that but there's a comment another person said there is always a lot of he said she said going on between divorced couples but in this case I'm going to have to go with the wife wishing her and her son the best that's basically where I stand on the other hand people are very angry this person said y'all Sons be murderers thieves drug addicts and y'all think Dwayne Wade loving on his trans daughter is detrimental to the black community I have time that one really sparked some debate on Twitter and obviously making an interesting point but yeah I digress this person said the way Dwyane Wade cleared his ex-wife's transphobia on Instagram is what every parent should be like again I do not believe this is transphobia I think that there is something that is much more complex much more nuanced it is family issues at the core of this this is not some broad social commentary at least on her part and the whole thing is really just a trip and since Siobhan just filed I'm guessing they were going to be seeing a lot more of this especially because this family has already been very public about ziya and about all of this now I don't know if Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union are using this child for financial gain or not I mean they are already ridiculously Rich so who knows but either way parading xayah around like some Progressive token is just weird and Zaya's biological mother regardless of what has gone on in their family regardless of how she has been legally pushed to the side deserves to have her concerns heard this is a serious issue okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett

the apes i also had that on my wall and i remember my online school brought her to do like an online symposium at one point oh my god fangirl to the nines i got to ask her a question it was like the best moment of 13 year old brett's life anyway um maybe somebody likes steve jobs just claiming that'd be interesting all right what best describes you bold observate creative badass adventurous critical thinker determined passionate and loyal um probably a critical thinker uh what city should you actually live in like a portland kill me um like none of these i don't want to live anywhere other than like my mom's farm in idaho are here literally um not paris this is a hot take i think paris is a little overrated yeah dad paris sucks i enjoyed it but i also spent most of my time there and i was like why did i just go to paris i should have gone to other parts of france you know um okay i've never been to barcelona but i do feel like i could have a good time in spain i don't want to live there this is so complicated this is a stupid buzzfeed quiz why am i stressing out maybe los angeles because i lived there for a while i don't know i don't know pick a magazine pick a medium of communist propaganda okay not scientific american we all saw what they did during covid uh fast company the new yorker vogue sports illustrated more like overweight illustrated these days y'all see that jordan peterson tweet sorry not beautiful the man pulls no punches um reader's digest i actually used to like reader's digest i'll do national geographic because the pictures are pretty i don't need to look at what they have to say about the environment the green new deal i'll just look at the pictures of animals what do you look for in a workplace a good challenged focused mission organized interested workers excitement job security attention to detail risk taking environment flexibility um probably a good challenge because i get bored easily i jumped from job to job because i didn't feel like my work was varied enough and that i was being like pushed every day so that's probably it okay pick a genre i don't like movies enough for this can it be books um probably an indie movie if i had to pick because social network instagram which by the way oh i should be a humanitarian you are a giver a justice seeker you spend more time thinking about others than yourself and more than anything you just want what you're doing to help somebody in some way essentially you is kind you were smart you was important okay quote from the help other occupations social worker or judge literally buzzfeed does not get me at all swinging a miss i'm not an but i'm not gonna spend my life thinking about social work i'm just not i think altruism when taken way too far is a cancer i'm just putting it out there you have to be a little bit selfish i believe in like the trickle down selfishness if you put yourself first you put your work first you make yourself into a good human being and you can take that and do good things in the world that are going to positively impact other people just spending all your time thinking about the world's problems not really gonna do a lot in my point of view or at least i wouldn't want to spend my time doing that i would feel depressed buzzfeed has literally let me down but you know what they're also communist propaganda like i was talking about with the magazines so they just don't get it they don't get it at all but all that being said you know it's good to give back sometimes especially when you spend your time talking about how you don't want the government to do things and how you don't want the government to dictate where your tax dollars go or which people are being helped sometimes it's good to take it upon yourself but even though i believe that it does not make me a social justice warrior humanitarian social worker buzzfeed doesn't get it they don't understand my nuances before you go make sure that you like this video

not common section because as you can see i am not really on my set i'm in another corner of my studio i have been given a wig by my producers and i'm going to be doing a bob ross painting now a little context i've never done a bob ross painting i've never actually seen a bob ross video and that shows you my real age that i own the only thing i know about rob ross is that he has big hair and that he says things like happy little trees and happy accidents so i feel like this is going to be a very supportive environment um other context i'm not an artist i see a lot of memes made about me where it's like oh brett can do all of these things except ride a bike but everything else she can do actually guys i also cannot do art all of my brothers exceptional artists did like high level art programs in high school and college my mom was an art major my dad also did some painting me no can't even figure out how to draw anything other than a stick person so if bob ross can help me paint something that i would want to put on my wall then maybe i will maybe i'll be a converted fan so let me explain the challenge that has been put in front of me and if any of you guys want to try this tag me in it let me know how you fare uh because bobby and sheller have put up a bob ross tutorial i am not allowed to pause it it is 29 minutes long i have to follow him in time no pauses no classic bret freakouts and i have to keep the wig on which is already getting in my eyes and i feel like there's going to be paint in it so we'll see how this goes all right sheller i'm ready i just want to go ahead and do this god i'm like sweating i'm going to be judged this is nice sheller's dancing you can't see him but he's off screen dancing that's what i have all right we bought the whole kit by the way welcome back certainly glad you decided to spend a half hour with us today i think you'll enjoy the little painting we're going to do and i hope you take the time to paint along we have our canvas up the liquid whites on it it's ready it is so i'm going to start off today with a little bit of that we'll use the old two inch brush grab a touch of the midnight black blue and mix them together let's go up here little crisscross strokes oh that's let's just drop in a happy just start at the top and work all the way across i feel like i love lucy in the chocolate episode and then begin working down oh look how not mixed that is oh that color he's doing so many fast movements and just sort of blend it all together strokes i'm just adding more in bob that easy you've got a fantastic now while little sky over to your darker color then we'll be down here on the base see there once again you'll get a lighter value not really hello there i think i went up too high am i supposed to marry the two i never use turpentine when i'm washing brushes oh i left a turkey i didn't do a center a hole you'd be working what do i do okay this is fine every brush and just tap the canvas with it that's blue i didn't get all the stuff off it's definitely still blue bob bob no i don't like that caress the cases oh i don't want to cross the campus that's not that's not a cloud that's far from a cloud okay let's build this little mountain today you know it's funny i get a lot of letters from people and sometimes they say you're using i'm tired of mountains do something probably as many letters a second some prussian blue okay paint out here the knife there it is but right now we're just looking oh that's not mixed scrape off all the excess paint in there shake it off my producer said that i can't slap the thing because then i'll make a mess oh no no so easy at times it's hard it's one way to fight to let this is like a berry blob make it sort of look like that how do they get green in there i haven't even used green yet wow we look it looks the same doesn't it i'm going to mix up so i didn't pull it all the way out to the side like he did throw some van dyke some crimson a little sap green whatever you get whatever i got mainly dark yep just be happy enjoy have fun happy happy happy i was the kid at christmas time they couldn't even figure out how to draw a christmas tree i still can't i don't know i said the kid i'm the adult that can't drive christmas trees maybe their lives bigger evergreen oh i'm using all my weight oh that's a big tree bop that's a big tree you're doing my friend how with the fan truly let's let's do have a third tree fun fact my first acting role ever i was a bush in my kindergarten thing musical whatever those are called i can't even think about it right now ah it's crap i messed up my happy little tree happy little bushes oh my god look at this all right now you have to make some decisions i don't know where my little bushes live what are we doing my bushes are not looking very happy okay it's not like the worst thing i've ever seen like my mom would probably hang it up in her house just because i'm her daughter green happy little green big tree big tree i'm just gonna pull some random things i think i'm just gonna be using the other brush you know what yolo yo freaking low it's like a sad christmas tree oh that's my hand correct should i switch it out should i do it hold on bob i'm coming i'm like slowing down here all right um oh my here it goes [Music] green i was telling my producers before we started i used the fan brush to put on my face masks at night which i thought would qualify me oh that is it awful that's not like that's not god-awful let's add some texture while he's talking about the fan also his voice sounds so quiet y'all because of this damn hair like how does he even hear his own thoughts is my question okay okay all these things okay all you have to do is super thank you bob i don't know what kind of tree this is but i have pick up a little bit oh a little here oh nope that is nasty nasty okay this look that looks like limbs i'm gonna say it oh boy no path in the middle of the tree exact technique a little more of the liquid i can't do that back into my i'm scared oh that was a bad idea that was a very bad idea i think they're in front right over here yeah like my path everybody i think i need the dark the dark color maybe like this and some brown to create the ground that's not good either that's not we're gonna just pretend like none of this ever happened we're gonna go back to the green and it's like not even sticking because i've done so much awful stuff to this canvas it's like lady you enjoy this one you free from all of us happy painting and god bless is that it [Music] no okay well hold on you know as i wrap up my thoughts that are deeply anxious and sweaty um i'm gonna try this is a very bad idea that seems like it's not gonna be the right color it's not but you know what what if i what if i just pull or or or or or hold on i just need to like fill this gap what if it's just the tree covering it that's the wrong color brett that is so bad so for my entire life i've dealt with um awful feelings of perfectionism and as a result my mother has always said that that is probably what made it so hard for me to do art because the rest of my family was just like freely like oh the happy trees and the happy accidents not me i was like my trees do not look happy they this is not perfect and i am not picasso therefore i shouldn't even be doing art which is kind of my thing but you know what this isn't the worst thing that i've ever seen would i do this again maybe i actually would like to try it and see if i can even do better on another one now that i know sort of what to expect i can even process things right now because i can't hear my own thoughts and i'm sweating and bob ross has given me anxiety but i don't think that's how it's supposed to feel he's so happy and yet i am so stressed that is my first attempt at bob ross painting let me know what you think in the comments below please be kind or you don't have to be either way i will read them and i'll probably weep but maybe this is gonna sit behind me in comment section you know what i have not received my 100 000 subscribers thing or my 1 million subscribers thing and we have a place on the wall for them they just have not arrived yet maybe this is the placeholder should i sign it this is gonna be some lucky person could win this most likely it's going to be my mother because she'll be like honey you did so good it's okay i wanted it right in the middle okay what do i do um brett thank you for watching we'll be back with another bob ross

they watched my youtube channel and straight up were just like this is what we're gonna do but one thing that stood out to me in his video when he was responding to some of my videos about grooming in you know gender theory in schools was that he used a very common leftist talking point which was you know people right of center or anybody that you know opposes gender theory and all of that are putting sex into people's minds that by pointing out that some of this stuff might be weird might be a bit creepy we are the ones making it sexual and making it sexual for kids all of that and it's cut and it's funny because then they turn around and like passionately defend all of it with all of the sexual stuff included and it's like you can't really have it both ways but per usual that's the left it's incredibly hypocritical and unprincipled but i have a fantastic example of the left putting sex into things without any of us having to do anything but before we get into it you guys know

what are you eating this pride well if you're a top it seems like you can eat whatever you want but if you're a bottom you're expected to starve not this pride introducing the bottom friendly menu from postmates we teamed up with dr evan goldstein from bespoke surgical to bring you a menu of bottom friendly foods backed by science insoluble fiber won't help you feel cute so avoid things like whole grains sweet bran cauliflower potatoes legumes hold up are you just fully diving into those beans the problem with these foods is they don't dissolve in water which could cause a traffic jam in your digestive system making a mess of your evening speaking of messy it's a good idea to avoid dairy oh my god it's dry quick basil lactose right now look at them if you're going to eat something insoluble give your body about 24 hours to process all of it [Music] soluble fibers and protein are the key to having some good clean fun these all digest easily and slowly while feeding your good gut bacteria which makes sushi a great bottom friendly option there's nothing everyone eats sushi again but if you're planning on getting peachy this pride the bottom friendly menu on postmates has the kinds of foods that could keep you feeling good are you [Music] look i didn't even see this at the end look at this a donation was made to the ocra project a black woman-led collective that addresses food insecurity mental health and financial barriers faced by the trans community oh my god they are black women and they're trans man hitting those intersectional boxes right and left we're all homos homo sapiens you know the thing that stood out to me now the second time that i've watched this and it was still as cringe as the first and again i'm so sorry that you had watched that with me is that the bottom friendly menu that they're promoting it's literally what we all should be eating if you saw the like do's and don'ts it was like fries and like hamburgers and like blueberry and on the other side it was like vegetables and non-processed foods why did you have to wait for pride month and this conversation about bottoms and tops to talk about healthy eating i'm not saying everybody go like start ordering off the bottom menu because obviously don't want to support that because that's just freaking creepy but you know it's just food for thought that was sort of a pun i didn't intend it to be it wasn't a good pun because i'm not good at puns but regardless they got ratioed although there were a fair amount of comments the top comments are people being like oh my god thank you this is so important like you're actually doing good work like you're not just like posting a rainbow whatever and i mean i do get that like postmates to your credit you didn't just change your logo you literally did this horrific advertisement and changed something on your app for pride so i guess that's better than just the virtue signaling even though i kind of hate it but people seemed excited about it but there were a few doctors in here that were saying this is not what people should be eating somebody said talk to a fiber expert and or dietitian next time a lot of this is pretty outdated and incorrect info on insoluble versus soluble fiber soluble versus insoluble rarely predicts fiber function alone which is more driven by coarseness vixen viscosity and gel forming capacity and fermentability wow love that try this and this person responds and says keep it down will you the food delivery company is teaching me about butt sex bias animated short on sm this is about as special as it gets that was great somebody else said what inspired you to change your corporations logo to a rainbow flag money yes exactly although i feel like post mates might be losing money after this ad somebody else said i will eat a big ass bowl of chili and get my belt wrong four hours later i don't give a this probably is my favorite one angela says makes sense considering you're at the bottom of the food delivery apps literally why would i have post mates if you can literally uber eats within the uber app that was not the only uh pride activities that went on this weekend this past weekend was when all of the big like national pride festivals and parades happen pride like started out as like marches and parades and that kind of thing they're not just like a little demonstration anymore they are a full-on like music festival in the street basically like there's performances there's flipping there's like you know drag kinky whatever dancing as you're gonna see this is not just some like happy hunky-dory like it's like normal people waving flags no it is this [Music] [Applause] oh there we go hello nice okay twerking per usual i mean like pop off but that's not a children's event drew hernandez posted this and said a woman forces a boy against his will to watch the la pride as lgbtq attendees twerk here in hollywood kind of weird again i don't know why that mother brought that child he looks very unhappy but this is mild for what you're about to see but i do appreciate this comment and it was the right to bear memes and yeah this is literally what the mother looked like she was doing to her child this person says i don't agree with forcing a child to be there but without context you're actually hurting the cause of everyone legitimately against this he might have been throwing a fit because he was told he couldn't have ice cream kids don't want to be a kid party sometimes yes very valid we don't exactly know what he was crying about but the fact that there was a child there while there are half naked people twerking and again they had more clothes on than what you're about to see that is naked this is dc that's a man with boobs oh [Applause] twerking on a cop oh that poor police officer that poor police officer like that poor man i'm so sorry but then look children children [Applause] [Music] marching behind this titty hanging out man who was clearly drugged up on something i hate it i hate it somebody said i stopped going to pride when i saw a man acting like a dog with a buttplug tail i thought like okay maybe i'm not as progressive as i thought yes listen it is totally fine and fantastic you know if you are lesbian if you're gay and we have lived in a society where that was not as accepted at times and you know what if you're proud of it totally fine that's great this is not some like hey i came out of the closet my family accepted me this is like i am a heathen drugged up twerking in front of children it is disgusting and inappropriate and freaky don't take your kids to pride somebody said this is probably my favorite comment of the whole day and these are the people who want to be able to determine who is mentally stable enough to own a gun or not last one again children i'm gay what age did you know that you were gay i think at like 10 i knew that i i think at 10 but i wasn't like i i wasn't clear on my gender yeah i i think it was around like 10 as well when i started questioning if i was bi and then since then it was kind of like a a slippery slope because i kept i was like am i bi omni lesbian and then i i kind of like came to the point and now recently i've been like in my pan but then i like i think now i'm starting to realize that i'm queer but yeah it was it started around 10 it wasn't like fully formed but i guess like that's when i realized wait that's a possibility yeah i am genderqueer trans mask and queer what's trans mask trans mask is like people under the non-binary umbrella at identifying like or presenting masks masculine yeah from a genuine hoping to empathize and understand i don't get what queer is is queer everything is queer nothing is queer like i'm some kind of non-straight sexuality but i don't fit into any of the boxes then just be gay she literally just affirmed that by being exposed to this radical whatever saying that it's cool that it's trendy influenced her now spiraling into this i am every single gender but i'm not a gender but i'm queer but i'm omni i'm pat i'm trans masculine some kind of bullsh kids need help they don't need gender theory shoved down their throat they need to be outside making friends riding bikes going through normal puberty stuff where are the freaking parents that's my question guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "VwZxRndMUyQ": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I think I've talked briefly about my family's history with like outdoor apparel companies because I did an episode on North Face becoming woke and I think we touched on Patagonia and then REI was doing their whole like drag queen lgbtq REI meetups that sort of thing my dad was an accountant for North Face for many years I think we all still have our original North Face jackets that we have not you know exchanged for over 20 years we also used to love Patagonia and then their quality kind of started going downhill and they got very political so my mom wanted to move away from them but like we are so invested in this outdoor apparel world that when I sent my mom that video of the drag queen wearing all the REI stuff she texted me back and she was like I'm literally tearing up like this is just heartbreaking it's kind of ridiculous to think that we have to want companies to just stay in their Lane and say please just keep making good jackets all of them are just kind of combusting in front of us that was a long rant about outdoor apparel and like working clothing companies but anyway I have a story for you about Patagonia before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring the notification Bell so that you never miss a comment section episode I've had to work on this pronunciation because as you all know sometimes I mispronounce things but Yvonne schweinard is the founder and was CEO for many years of Patagonia and yesterday he announced that he has now given up his ownership of the company Patagonia tweeted out and said hey friends we just gave our company to planet Earth okay it's more nuanced than that but we're closed today to celebrate this new plan to save our one and only home we'll be back online tomorrow basically the founder of Patagonia he has given up ownership of the company he placed two percent of it in a trust to protect the company's values and the Integrity of the company and the other 98 percent has been dispersed to a couple of non-profits that are fighting climate change and saving the Earth doing all that environmentalism stuff obviously people who hate billionaires are stoked [Music] this is probably my favorite comment from the entire ordeal somebody said I can't wait for patagonia's profits to be spent on paying politicians athletes and celebrities to fly on their private jets and give speeches about climate change awareness it's kind of sad because I love the outdoors I love the environment I do want to protect our planet because I think it is beautiful and it gives us so much and we need it we rely on it but the current climate World current environmentalism world is so politicized and it is so gross and is so hypocritical so when I see this move by Patagonia I want to be excited about it but instead I have an awful taste in my mouth and I go oh my God like are you kidding me you're basically funding Greta thundberg how dare you you're funding Taylor Swift to take a two-minute jet ride to go pick up marinara sauce from the grocery store somebody said the Patagonia airs today well my Grandpa gave my inheritance to Greenpeace uh yeah that's a little too real these are the details from the exclusive New York Times piece rather than selling the company or taking it public Mr swinard his wife and his two adult children have transferred their ownership of Patagonia evaluated about three billion dollars to a specifically designed trust in a non-profit organization they were created to preserve the company's Independence and ensure that all of its profits some 100 million dollars a year are used to combat climate change and protect undeveloped land around the globe they go on to talk about how two percent of the company has been put in this trust and they say that the trust which will be overseen by members of the family and their closest advisors is intended to ensure that Patagonia makes good on its commitment to run a socially responsible business and give away its profits because the shrinards donated their shares to a trust the family will pay about 17.5 billion dollars in taxes on the gift and I think that is a really important part because a lot of people were criticizing the move and saying oh this is probably just some like really smart like tax evasion all billionaires are still bad like no say what you want about you know the company and you know where they're sending their money back clearly they have a mission in mind they have a purpose I can admire that and they're going to put their money where their mouth is and they're willing to pay you know millions of dollars to make that happen so more power to them I guess this is the letter that Yvonne wrote himself I won't read all of it but he said Earth is now our only shareholder that's also what they put on their website it's definitely a catchy PR thing and people on the left environmentalists like they are very happy about this they are immediately bringing Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk into this going why aren't they doing this like you see you don't need all this money whatever it's catchy I will say in the letter he says he never wanted to be a businessman he just started as a Craftsman he was making you know outdoor apparel for his rock climbing friends for himself he was rock climber and then he realized that there was not the quality that he wanted so he just did it himself and it grew and it grew and it grew now it's in you know Ventura California it's where they're based and then he goes on to talk about the changes being made and he says uh they thought about taking the company public they thought that they would just sell the company and donate all the money but in both of those circumstances they would have no control over the future of Patagonia the values how you know the products were made all of that so this is why they decided to do this move in his own words he says this is how it works 100 of the company's voting stock transfers to the Patagonia purpose trust created to protect the company's values and 100 of the non-voting stock has been given to the hold fast collect active a non-profit dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature the funding will come from Patagonia and each year the money we make after reinvesting in the business will be distributed as a dividend to help fight the crisis and then he just says thank you for all your support whatever overall you know it's his money it's his company he can do what he wants with it but I mean I think that this is kind of a classic case of another out of touch billionaire I mean wow I sound like a leftist there obviously of course the internet has a lot of thoughts because if there is one thing that happens on Twitter it is hating billionaires and talking about climate so this has been a huge deal somebody said the only good billionaires are former somebody said I sincerely hope so and it's not some type of scheme to make more money in tax Dodge which we did just debunk because they are going to have to pay an exorbitant amount of taxes this year another person said he just gave away his company worth three billion dollars he would not have given me a hundred grand if I asked him he just threw his billions into a rubbish dump uh I mean true I don't think that the owner of Patagonia would given you a 100 Grand just if you asked for it but again it is his money if he does want to give it to a rubbish dump he can't he does not owe you anything but that's kind of an entitled way to look at it if he wants to give away all of his money to a rubbish jump that's his prerogative because of somebody that despises government authoritarianism I would not want them telling me what I can and cannot do with my fortune so agree but also disagree somebody else said commendable but how do you fight climate if China and India the two largest polluters are not at the table willing to make concessions yeah well that brings me to my big concern with this entire thing because I just want to know how much good this nonprofit is actually going to do because so far the nonprofits are doing nothing like that first reply that I read stated I feel like this is just going to end up being an activism tactic like they're going to use those 100 million dollars per year just to funnel advertisements and get speakers and get Greta into the U.S and that sort of thing in my opinion as somebody that is free market oriented believes that capitalism truly does lift people out of poverty and can make sustainable change and drive us forward as a society I would say why not take the profits that you don't reinvest and instead make your products in the United States find more sustainable ways to do it Patagonia parades themselves around as being awoke and sustainable and you know helping the environment but they produce a crap ton of their products in India and China and these countries that really contribute to the climate crisis more than what the United States does so if you actually care about making a change why don't you make the change why don't you make tangible changes to your company which would actually further your purpose of being more sustainable in helping the environment rather than just pawning off your money to a nonprofit that is probably just going to pump out climate change fear porn because that's basically what these non-profits do and I know I know that part of the non-profit is about preserving natural lands and I do think that is very cool in addition to my dad working in North Face he also worked at a few trust Republic lands I think those are incredibly important but that is also a very small portion of what they are trying to accomplish with this non-profit with this new trust with the setup I am just so tired of this assumption that is in our society right now that non-profits are the only organizations and institutions that can do good in the world that's an absolute lie I think that these people have the potential to create such incredible change if they would just focus their time and energy and resources on Innovation that better Society like it's really that simple do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed

an episode that i have been waiting for i don't know why i haven't done it yet now in other episodes i have dropped little easter eggs of information about this situation in our country but now it's going to get its moment we're putting the spotlight on the irs now full disclosure i dislike the irs almost as much as i dislike the atf i think both of those government bodies are absolutely useless they do nothing to protect citizens in fact they just harm us more they steal our money they tell us that we can't protect ourselves it's up there actually with the department of education too which is a hot take it's more tingly than hot yeah but i'm just saying those three they harm us more than they help us but anyway before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and if you want to go check out my merch you can go to dailywire.com brett this is our first capsule but there is so much more to come i'm so excited for you all to see it this has been a really fun process i'm not a designer by any means so it's been very cool to like watch all of this unfold and i hope you guys all like it it's been fun back to my attempts to radicalize all of you as part of the new inflation reduction act which biden thinks is going to solve all of our problems the irs is planning to hire 87 000 new agents the government in this town is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently in addition to that there are some new tax laws i think you all have heard about them wanting to survey your venmo and cash apps in case you're sending more than 600 god forbid it's also important to point out right here that elon musk was tweeting about this a few days ago and he was saying they're not coming after the rich they're not coming after me i get audited routinely every year they're coming for middle class americans now which is true they wouldn't be looking at measly 600 venmo payments if they were trying to tax the rich just important to think about that now another important thing to note about this act about the conversation surrounding the irs is that this bill is arguing that these new 87 000 agents are just coming in to fill the slots of 50 000 agents that are about to retire but number one i don't believe the government's rationality about anything they gaslight us and they lie to us all the time so don't really care number two 87 000 is a lot more than 50 000 it does not take a mathematician to figure that out so they are still adding agents even though they want to convince you that they're not number three these people have not retired yet and even if that argument was correct and true when this is going to be a problem that we're losing all of these agents that is still 37 000 more agents than we had before i don't even want to fill the 50 000 spots that are about to be emptied get rid of them all [Music] but obviously the government isn't listening to me in the slightest and after this act was announced uh people found the irs's new job description for their irs agents uh my favorite part of that was that they were saying you need to know how to wield a gun and be willing to use deadly force in your job and you have to work 24 7. going after the little guy oh boy one whole farley thomas massey posted some video clips and some pictures a couple of days ago that went viral from a mock irs investigation that happened this spring at a college where agents were teaching potential recruits what it takes to be on the front lines of a broke authoritarian government who was stealing your money and this is an official irs program where they go around and they do these mock investigations and they get people excited about being like a secret irs agent i mean they are literally getting people excited about stealing your money while they lie to you about inflation and a non-existent recession well gas prices are still skyrocketing which is why it is so important to make sure that you can still put food on the table for your family which is why i am so grateful for my favorite meat delivery service good ranchers because they have a recession and inflation-proof subscription model that lets you lock in your price the day that you subscribe so you don't have to worry about any crap that biden is doing you don't have to worry about prices increasing you're safe and in addition to making sure that you have food on the table goodranchers is also on a mission to donate 100 000 meals to kids in need in this back-to-school season to help them meet their goal i am offering 10 of you the chance to come hang out with me over zoom on september 29th for 30 minutes you might say it's a meet and greet that was so bad i apologize in advance but uh in order to be eligible go to goodranchers.com cooper and use promo code cooper that will get you 30 off of your order plus free shipping you will get an incredible box of meat you will get to hang out with me possibly and you will be helping good ranchers on their mission what is not to love the irs that's what you should not love congress recently appropriated funds so the irs is currently looking to hire more special agents or cis nationwide looking around starting around sixty seventy thousand dollars somewhere in there uh and then the advancements are you'll move up one cartoon every year for the first few years so an agent that's been in the field for a long time can top out at around 175 000 a year as well as benefits and retirement these aren't actual police officers they're students i'm sorry first of all in what situation would the irs be wrapping you in chains they're gonna put you all back in chains you didn't mark that 600 venmo payment down on your tax return wrap it up buddy like what the hell arresting a man who has wanted four tax evasions who are you guys uh what is this we're the irs you're under arrest you're going to jail buddy most people don't even know that the irs has criminal investigators who use their accounting skills and their authority as a special irs agent to help solve tax crimes now i will say this might be the coolest thing that i've heard about an account never that there's an accountant criminal special agent and i can say that because my best friend is an accountant i love you madison i know you're watching that don't hate me anyway okay back to the video under this scenario these students find the owner of a landscaping company had several vehicles that may have been purchased from monies not reported through his business after an undercover interview using a wireless mic the special irs agents find that dodger who is selling his business has two sets of books never done any landscaping just in my front yard ammunition handcuffs and first aid is generally what everybody wears and then it just depends on the individual and what else they want to carry and no tasers no tasers that's what okay does that make sense yeah he was so smug when he said no tasers like yeah we don't play with kids we're not one of those police officers with tasers we only carry ammunition tax evasion and in the end they're taught how to use their skills and finally arrest the mock offender but we want to identify hey police we're here with an arrest warrant we're going to be taking you to jail today okay that's what you they want to know because they're going to start asking questions like i did who are you what are you doing why are you putting me in cuffs what did i do the comments were hysterical there were a lot of people who were going like this is really necessary like you don't want people evading taxes do you yeah i don't care sure i'm gonna be on some list after that uh but somebody said i'm british so forgive me if this is a stupid question tax inspectors used to be boring humorless accountant types when did they turn into fully armed swat teams if you want to come in you are going to have to break down the goddamn door oh god yeah this is like the character development of the century is tax inspectors and accountants are now special agents this is a big deal it's a big deal jessica o'donnell said why do they need guns and someone replied to her and said not for stealing your money i can tell you that uh parentheses i'm actually kind of glad they are finally so transparent the taxation is armed robbery and then people started replying to some of the screenshots and the pictures that massey had posted and one guy said as a certified range safety officer the violations in every one of those pictures makes me ill which to be fair these are all possible recruits with plastic guns but at the same time as part of this possible recruiting and training maybe you should tell them to not hold a gun like this there was also some girl in the back of one of these photos who was like doing a charlie's angels pose and i'm like girl like plea let's not glamorize and sexualize the irs like charlie's angels like not the move my lady but there's more there's more videos from this project that the irs is embarking upon to get new recruits literally like an episode of parks and rec to be honest like does this not look like pawnee's city hall [Music] i'm sorry irs special agents is basically the grown-up version of boys running around with fake guns in their backyard it honestly feels like these people are all just larping as like jason bourne wannabes jesus christ irs agents okay so under this video i saw my favorite comment of the day and somebody said imagine surviving the pandemic only for a failed walmart greeter to break into your house must handle a weapon and leave you bleeding out while they try to justify their use of force no hate to walmart greeters but that's a really funny comment obviously you still have to point out again that this is not the official irs like training of their special agents i would hope that it's at least somewhat better that they at least teach them some semblance of gun safety i don't know but this is an official irs project where they are recruiting agents to try to convince people to apply and that's the worrisome part like their pitch is basically come work for the irs you're basically a cop at this time you're super above the law and you can steal from people legally with guns it's so much fun please do not apply for that job have some semblance of a moral compass and realize that you are just doing glorified robbery don't apply guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to

think of this episode because in my mind it's a tad Niche this is very Tick Tock centered drama it's not very mainstream but you know what these people these Tick Tock celebrities they are becoming mainstream it's kind of wild to think about how you know in the early 2000s we had the Paris Hiltons and the Britney Spears and all these huge pop stars and now the people that are Mega famous are you know the Charlie demilios and little hoodie and Addison Ray who is who we're going to be talking about today people if you don't know who any of those people are that is okay and you probably live a happier life than most of us who do know who they are but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and if you are interested go to dailywire.com Brett to check out the first capsule of my merch collection so to set the scene for you all for a little bit of backstory Addison Ray is a huge tick tocker like millions and millions and millions and millions millions and millions of followers she started making tick tocks I believe in the fall of 2019 she was a student at LSU she quickly started skyrocketing towards Fame and she dropped out of school moved to LA and then it's just only grown from there she's now singing she's been in movies and while her Fame rapidly grew her family's Fame grew as well sort of like the dimelios where they kind of became this viral Family unit like her parents now a tick tocks account they were doing trending dances they were making YouTube videos and they all just got super rich and super famous but there was some drama bubbling under the surface her parents were originally together had Addison and then they split up and divorced for a few years when she was very young then they got back together and then they became famous together and then some cheating allegations came out earlier this year that the dad whose name is Monty Lopez was apparently having an affair with a 25 year old woman and apparently he had lied to her and said that he and Sherry who is Addison Ray's mom were separated and so it was totally fine but Sherry is saying no we were not separated we were still married you still cheated on me so now the whole family is split apart and their dirty laundry is hanging out for literally everybody on the internet to see and so they split up maybe two months ago and Sherry immediately changes her Instagram to single mom and starts posting thirst traps and listen the lady's beautiful she is 40 something but has clearly taken care of herself I mean y'all if you want to look like that when you're 44 you should be using Demi skincare because this lady's skin is Flawless Mimi's skincare is 100 an American-made brand and they even

my entire life during this whole split and all of this drama a now viral famous SoundCloud rapper named young gravy thanks my God I can't believe this is my life young gravy starts posting about how he loves MILFs and if you don't know what the term MILF is it originated in the film American Pie and it means Mom I'd like to and so it's usually used by younger guys who are into older sexy women God's sake you're a bunch of friends degenerates he started going viral posting all of these you know tick tocks about these older women one of whom was Sherry and Sherry in her newly single era really liked that and so she started posting responses to him here's one of them back in America I'm looking to make some more you feel me trying to butter the biscuit that was great and then it took to buy all of those biscuits put them in the oven put on your little apron and stand there like ma'am you are a mother what is going on anyway young gravy really liked that and so they started doing a little flirtation back and forth on Tick Tock and on Instagram and the ex-husband Monty did not like that and he starts having a bit of a breakdown on social media and he posts this oh [Music] he says when at young gravy won't accept a boxing match and then he does this really really cringe flexing gritting his teeth and then at the very end at the very bottom it goes run white boy run throughout all of this the only person that I really care about is Addison is this poor like 22 year old girl who did dances on Tick Tock suddenly became famous and now her parents messy divorce and Affairs are being aired out online and all she's trying to do is sell her new lipstick that she made immediately regret this decision obviously she's not having a good time and she unfollows both of her parents on social media and there's all of these accounts online that track people's followers and they immediately caught on to that and they were posting all these screenshots of like Addison unfollows her parents and Sherry responded to one of those and goes this is heartbreaking I didn't deserve it it's like okay maybe you're not the worst person in the world but you're still posting thirst traps about a 24 year old boy and you're in the midst of a divorce and this boy is like closer to your daughter's age like obviously I'm guessing she's gonna be uncomfortable by that that did not stop Sherry from taking it a step further she did not go oh hey my daughter is clearly uncomfortable with this we should maybe make this more private we'll handle our family situations no instead she decides to go to the VMA Awards with young gravy and they packed on the PDA I have three different videos for you avert your eyes if you don't want to see some cougar MILF action all right here we go and here they are oh nice kissing kissing all right there's one so they kissed on the on the black carpet it's not a red carpet and then here we go again oh this is during the award show so in the middle of the award show they're sitting next to each other making out and then here's another one they did interviews together and kissed during that and they're in matching outfits can we just take a look at her dress even if somebody was 22 years old I would still not really like that dress like you are fully on display and I just can't get over the fact that you are somebody's mother I'm all about you know where would you want to wear if you are comfortable it's not my life but as a daughter that makes me uncomfortable just saying and I also think it's important to look at Sherry's facial expressions in all of this like she does not look comfortable she's like oh god what have I gotten myself into I'm now like half naked in an award show with a 24 year old boy I'm 20 years younger than her so people lost their damn Minds it was basically next to lizzo was the only thing that caught people's attention at the VMA somebody said young gravy with Addison's mom is one of the best PR moves I've seen in a minute the BR Department was cooking in their little cubicle with that one so obviously people are split about whether this is real or whether it is a PR stunt in my mind I think it started out as real because Sherry was you know single and flirty and kind of hungry and then her BR Team was probably like hey Sherry this would be a really good look you'll get boosted you'll get tons of Fame from you know hanging out with young gravy and now she's like crap what have I done that's kind of my perspective about all of it somebody else said if young gravy so much as glances in the general direction of my mother I am kicking him in the throat same disgusting little man it's so weird even young gravy though had a response because like I said Twitter went wild basically every pop culture and tabloid magazine was writing about them at the VMAs going like what's going on is this PR is it not PR and he tweeted out and said she's newly single and living her life leave her alone he's also done some podcast episodes recently where he said that they have a real connection but they're also just like hanging out so it's all very vague I can't believe that I'm spending my time dissecting a cougar MILF relationship but that's kind of where we are right now I promise I will have a lesson at the end of this so then we are back to Monty the ex-husband who also had a response he was going a little crazy on Tick Tock now he was unleashing holy hell on Instagram the night at the VMAs he posted this uh shirtless selfie what the hell is even that and said unbothered thank you young gravy for taking the leftovers I would rather spend time with my daughter and two grandkids that Sherry Nicole made me abandon as a child in order to be with her never let a woman make you choose between her or your blood child so apparently he's sort of referring to the time when they were divorced many years ago and he was not in the children's lives and Sherry was a single mom before that but that was not all he did he also wrote a diss track about young gravy [Music] that's only a bit of it but he's selling young gravy uh to cut his hair so that he doesn't look like a housewife and that he is avoiding Monty's fight and that little diss track his first ever single is called leftovers and he did in fact post that on his Instagram story so if anybody is still wondering why Addison Ray unfollowed both of her parents on social media I think we all I think it's pretty clear this whole situation even though it is semi-rediculous pop culture drama it is very indicative of how narcissistic our culture has become and I've talked about this before but we are now living in this digital age where no matter how many followers you have no matter how much attention there is on you people feel the need to air out all of their crap online for everybody to see there are basically no boundaries between your public life and your private life and having a private life is not only okay but it is essential we are watching a family crumble apart in front of us it's also not only indicative of you know our narcissistic culture but it is also indicative of our fail killing Society where families are falling apart it is incredibly unhealthy there is very little loyalty like this whole story it's just a bit of a dumpster fire which is kind of where our society is and you might call me a traditionalist for advocating for nuclear families and traditional families and that sort of thing but I would so much rather have that and have a private life than have something like this and if this is the modern contemporary cool family of 2022 I don't want it do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that Bell so you never miss an episode", "-k_K7yqrpfE": "that is a naked crackhead rolling around on the street then climbing oh my God ah that part holy crap crap welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper so if you follow politics at all if you're on any kind of semi-political social media whatever then you know that Chicago's mayor is Lori Lightfoot and she is basically Beetlejuice she is genuinely the worst people on both sides of the political aisle hate her she makes everybody angry and to be honest she just really needs to be reeled

is genuinely awful let's just watch she just posted this I mean she's literally Beetlejuice [Music] [Music] have y'all seen the crime in Chicago I don't think it's sweet Home Chicago anymore good god well Lori Lightfoot is hosting a city-wide karaoke competition starting this week and going until November 6th so if any of you guys are in Chicago and are just itching to do karaoke with Lori Lightfoot now is your opportunity now not only is this undeniably cringe it is also just scary like imagine you're asleep and you wake up and you see Beetlejuice Lori Lightfoot standing over you crooning ah nobody says the b word come on like it's horrifying it is almost as scary as meat recalls which is why it is so important that good ranchers is around because guys they have never had to recall their products ever good ranchers only sources the highest quality meat their beef is either USDA prime or upper Choice their chicken is better than organic with no added hormones or antibiotics and their Seafood is caught fresh and then flash frozen and vacuum sealed so that when it arrives to you it is as fresh as humanly possible and like I said good ranchers has literally never had to do a meat recall because they have a 100 satisfaction guarantee because you actually know where your meat is coming from and how it is sourced so go to goodranchers.com Cooper and then use promo code Cooper at checkout because guys you do not want to miss this deal just like you do not want to miss Lori Lightfoot getting roasted in these comments nobody liked this video whatsoever somebody said the Sweet Home Chicago I once love is gone and now I love my home in Florida like literally guys all of the comments they were just a major Vibe like a major major white pill somebody said how do they get elected like who are the idiots that vote them in the Democrats we know the answer to that somebody else said damn I didn't realize Beetlejuice had such a good voice seriously though a city and utter turmoil and this is the [\u00a0__\u00a0] she is doing yes because she does not care she is just like Governor Newsom she is happy to go operating around with her friends doing publicity stunts rather than addressing the actual issues in her City and in Newsome's case his entire freaking State this person says bruh your city is in shambles what is this another person said oh God let the bodies hit the floor would have been a more appropriate choice for Chicago's Warlord but you know this is not her first rodeo this is not her first 4A into the tick tock Stratosphere these are a couple of my favorite videos from the last year just look at these [Music] excellent love her outfit choices this is fantastic outfit of the day did not know that she was a fashion blogger this is also a great one this is when lalapalooza was going on yeah all we need is us [Music] Laura's really trying to make herself into like a musical icon but she has no rhythm that was also edited terribly [Music] [Music] like I think her social media team is intentionally sabotaging her which I'm kind of okay with but guys it's so bad it's edited terribly the timing is off she's attempting to do Trends but very very poorly this is not some cool hip in with the Gen Z move this is just making people dislike you more the most recent video even made its way to Twitter which I really enjoyed somebody said maybe she's looking for a new line of work so she obviously sucks at being a mayor but you know what I would kind of prefer her being a singer over mayor so maybe she should somebody said why is Lori Lightfoot spending taxpayer dollars to make herself karaoke videos shouldn't she be using those funds to address the runaway violence in Chicago that would make too much sense actually King covid says why is Beetlejuice ruining good Tunes can't wait for Elon Musk to take over Twitter I'm gonna say terrible terrible things oh lord I can't wait somebody said she's got so much free time on her hands having solved Chicago's crime problem and all yeah irony my favorite these are the types of things that are going on in her City we're just gonna start off with a basic one this is just a casual you know Thursday morning armed robbery something that happens lots of times in Chicago like this is so smooth here we go into the car while people are sitting in it very fast literally 40 seconds and they're out because lawlessness they know that they can get away with it it gets so casual and now they're just getting back in their car and driving away because it's Chicago and then for something that's a tad more exciting avert your eyes if you don't want to see this because there is some crackhead nudity here we go this is a naked woman oh she's running and she's getting in a car oh now she's in the middle of the street apparently we're playing dead now I also just want to know why this is allowed on Twitter oh poor man oh my God she's in the front seat [Music] back head rolling around on the street then climbing oh my God I didn't even see that part holy crap [Music] oh God I bet Lori Lightfoot just wanted to invite her to do karaoke though I'm sure she doesn't care so while fat naked people are running over police cars and rolling around in the middle of the street in Chicago Lori is busy making those tick tocks and thinking about Lollapalooza and also making Walgreens runs literally look at her and her Security in Walgreens and what is she carrying a whole box of modelos that that um that is real like why why here she is cracking open a cold one with a crackheads out on the street of Chicago that is where her priorities lie apparently hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "qcLUDBDhRug": "foreign welcome back to off the clock I am very excited about this episode because we're diving into some interesting territory here I don't really do a lot of things using Reddit purely because the platform itself intimidates me tremendously because it just seems like a hell hole can of worms but I do go there to look at memes that people make about me and my team in the show because they are very funny and if you guys make them you know who you are thank you for making me laugh anyway as you know if you've been watching the show for a while two of my producers met their wives on dating apps scheller met his wife and Bobby met his wife and then I was talking to the rest of my team and a lot of them are on dating apps or have used them in the past so I thought that this would be the perfect opportunity to dive into this hellscape basically so I went on Reddit and I found a few different threads where people were asking for online dating advice they were getting their profiles ranked and I obviously have no experience I'm not married I'm really not credible in this world so this is just going to be my honest humble opinion about all of this however I do know that I have common sense and that I probably have more brain cells than some people out in the world so I think maybe I can give you some sort of advice and ranking about what I'm seeing on Reddit but to start us off I did want to get first-hand accounts from people that I know so I did send a message in my slack Channel with my team and I asked their thoughts on online dating so John said no group pictures where no one knows which one you are that seems very fair uh Steven said don't be a guy in this day and age that seems like a lot to ask Stephen you're being real you're being a big bigot right now the trans women need you um Liam said stop saying you like hiking that's not a personality trait I walk up hills outside good for you I love my couch uh that also just kind of is perfect for Liam so I'm so glad that he has the boundary but we are going to talk about girls talking about their hobbies and Adventures because apparently that is a very hot button issue for men this is going to be for both men and women I'm helping everybody I'm basically the Dalai Lama at this point I just want you all to know all right so I started going through these threads uh I found this one was very interesting this is on uh our slash Tinder and this person posted a conversation that he had with this woman and they matched and she says hey we matched and we're pretty close so that's cool full disclosure I am married but we are ethically non-monogamous so I'm not looking for anything relationship wise just friendship fun and possibly sex sorry I had to disclose this after we matched but I figured out only creeps intentionally match with me when they see married yeah that kind of makes sense considering your lifestyle uh so I stopped putting that in my bio at all and I only tried Tinder once for a year ago giving it another go because I'm nervous in person and this is the thing this actually ends up being so nice the guy responds and goes no that's okay I actually just got divorced and I'm casually looking that's odd red flag I guess uh but he says the whole thing is just a major red flag I promise there's a silver lighting and he says but I'm not sure I'm up for it because I'm looking for someone to eventually build something with that seems you know you just said you're casually looking but you want something long-term dude figure out your life before you involve women and then he says but I really appreciate you taking the first move I wish more women did that that's positive and then she goes on to say well if you would like to genuinely just be friends I'm totally cool with that as well I don't require sex to have fun getting to know someone just let me know as an adult is a pain in the ass to even try to make friends and I miss being social uh and then she just goes on to say that some people are awful or trash their marriage based on their personal opinion that was weirdly respectful and kind of just made me sad more than anything I'm not going to sit here and Bash somebody's marriage even though that's definitely not something that I would be interested in partaking in but these people both just seem sad like he's just divorced and he's casually dating but wants to build something so clearly he wants to get back out there but it's probably nervous and feels like he's gonna get hurt but she seems completely unfulfilled in her ethically non-monogamous relationship she misses being social she wants to make friends hey ma'am Demi maybe you would have fun being social with your husband if he was not being ethically non-monogamous with other women that's not me being judgmental that's me looking out for your mental well-being we are monogamous creatures we want to find somebody to cohabitate with and be social with think about that my friend anyway but the comments kind of reflected what I was saying um somebody said I usually come for the drama so I was expecting the next screenshot to be here cussing him out it's fun to be wrong sometimes another person said clearly this post must be fake designed to convince us that there is hope for the future yeah the internet is actually being nice for once that's crazy but maybe these people will learn that they should actually try to be serious and work on themselves first and then maybe they can fall in love maybe it's this is the beginning of a rom-com and I'm just not even aware of it um so then there's a lot of people that post their profiles and ask for advice and again I was expecting a lot of people to get absolutely roasted and there were some guys out there that were like really clearly putting themselves out there and like had some real cringy things I was like oh my God like dude why why and people in the comments were so nice I expected online dating Reddit to be awful but people were like it's okay like maybe just change this this is a little blurry I bet you have another one that's a better angle I was like this is oddly comforting in a way but anyway um this guy did his whole profile we don't need to go through all of it it seems pretty basic but he said I can teach you how to do this and he has a woman on his shoulder and the kid but then he puts his Mantra it's one of those like hinge things and he goes my Mantra is the less you give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] the happier you'll be and I have such like a weird relationship with this kind of mindset because I think I've said it before the way I live my life is that I take my life very seriously my work the people in my life but I don't take myself seriously like I'm the first to laugh at myself I really do not give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] if I'm gonna use his language if I you know make myself look ridiculous I'm pretty easy going when it comes to just me but I I don't just throw it all away when it comes to my life like I have goals I have ambition and so I kind of this weirds me out a little bit because I don't know what you mean do you mean that you're like live laugh love giggle giggle funny I like to have a good time or are you saying I'm a man with no prospects I don't give a crap about anything ever the world is meaningless I shouldn't even try to build a family or make any money or live a good life be specific is all I'm saying but like I could like where this is going but I also could you know not be a lot of these dating apps it's just like pure confusion and I get it because you only have so many characters and prompts to answer all of these questions and find somebody but in my mind it's like succinct to the point but I'm also a very intense person and so it's like I need you to give me all of your information and your goals and your values before I would approve so I also have like a very complicated relationship with it um okay I have some other advice from one of my team members she had a lot of thoughts from Katie she said she agreed with the stop group photo she's just messaging me right now so I'm seeing she said stop with the group photos it's just confusing she said the tone of your voice matters don't be too aggressive I agree with that also like some of these messages that people were posting work I was like hey sup hottie oh I was like okay well that's just aggressive again don't wear a mask in your photos literally yes it is 2022. it's about to be 2023. it has been three years since this pandemic has started Biden literally said in his 60 Minutes interview this week that covid the pandemic is over remove the photos with masks I don't care if you think your eyes look great I don't care if you are in a really pretty setting remove it it is now a political statement and I do not want to see it also the vaccine cards I swear to God if you post those that was cool for a week everybody posting those on their story stop it stop it I saw a lot of people going like should I put this should I say I'm vaccinated no nobody cares it's your life why are you disclosing all of your personal medical information somebody said make sure to comment on prompts oh this is like on hinge so on hinge where you can do you know oh this is really interesting or like here's my Mantra or whatever apparently Katie is saying you need to comment on people's prompts rather than their photos I kind of agree with that but I feel like the prompts where you really get to the good stuff I don't know that's I'm just guessing but that's from Katie okay so back to Reddit um this guy says he is looking for improvements or criticism all right here we go he doesn't oh he hid his name I wanted to call you by name and give you the respect that you deserve oh that's a big fish oh my all right the full image we have a very that's actually a very impressive fish I know people rag on fish photos all the time but like that seems like you are a true angler is that what they call fisherman like you are serious angler I have another girl on my team she loves fishing we did like a spotlight during her first week of working here and it was a whole fish photo this is sir I have a woman for you she loves candy and she's conservative um all right so this guy there's apparently another fish photo oh here's another one okay that one's a pretty fish you look nice but you're you're the fish is smaller so I'm not it's like that's not as impressive let's go on to another one a cowboy hat that's great see you have photos with other people but by now we sort of know who you are so I think that's more acceptable and I get that it's very awkward I don't really take photos alone all the time unless it's like one of my photo shoots so I get it I don't have a bunch of like photos of me just you know sitting around so I I excuse it later on in the profile I think let's see their classic mirror selfie everybody has one I don't have a problem with them some people really do oh and then that's like a video of you maybe doing um what's that thing where you go under the rung the bending over backwards limbo I was about to say hookah that's very different clearly I was an unsocialized homeschooler limbo I played that once at a Hawaiian luau that I threw for like my 10th like back to school party or something like that anyway I guess that's that's an aside but let's see what people say about this um also I appreciate this guy he's a Christian he says he's conservative he's looking for a life partner I'm not kidding Rebecca where are you this man is for you I don't know where he's located though um but I appreciate that this guy says he's religious says he is conservative that's great guys don't shy away don't say I'm a Centrist if you are strong no no be staunch in your values because if you are trying to find somebody if you were trying to find a meaningful connection do not hide the things that are important to you you're going to waste time you're going to waste days weeks or months meeting her on the bush not knowing important things about one another say your politics because in this day and age it is important and don't be shy and people who get upset with you on these apps they're not worth your time anyway anyway what I appreciate is the people in this Reddit thread and Reddit is so Lefty they said nothing about his politics they were saying oh dude that fish photo's so sick like we know that girls don't really like fish photos but like that one's So Dope like you clearly really like fish nobody said anything about him being conservative that was like so refreshing this entire segment is I've been putting it together I've been Overjoyed basically with the positivity of people on the internet maybe my tune about Reddit has been changed but this person said the general rule is no fish photos that said photo number one is spectacular and I believe that you should keep it I would recommend replacing the other two photos of fishing as they are redundant and somebody said after the first two fish pictures I was honestly hoping all of your photos were going to be of you holding fish in different scenarios that would actually be a great gag profile so gag profiles obviously it is certainly a way to go if you are a very funny person if you pride yourself on being humorous and honestly you know really take account of yourself think am I a funny person before you make a gag profile because you're setting yourself up as being like a funny guy don't make one of those and then not be able to tell a joke or laugh kind of common sense um but that being said if he really is like an angler and loves fishing that could be very funny but again I don't have a problem with that first fish photo because it's on like the guy said spectacular and I love that everybody in the comments even the girls were going yeah that's really cool really those are the only comments they liked his photos one person said that he should take a mirror selfie with his phone like away from his face but again like all mirror selfies are kind of Taken like this so but I kind of agree they're a bit ridiculous all right here we go this person also wants reviews um Ryan has pronouns I can't tell because this is like clearly from the back end I can't tell if they are publicizing that they are using those pronouns or if hinge is just putting it on your profile like you are using he him his pronouns I don't remember I haven't been on hinge do they put I think that they do put the pronouns I don't know if you can choose to display or not display but regardless if you do display and you are not getting matches and you are in a more based red area of the country that could be a reason why I'm just saying but at the same time if you are somebody that places a value on pronouns you know a based person probably wouldn't be the right fit for you anyway so maybe maybe I'm actually gonna go full circle on this because if you are somebody who thinks that pronouns are the most important thing maybe you should leave them up because then the normal people can move past you and we're not wasting anybody's time all right well we're going to continue on with Ryan I don't this all seems fine he's doing a lot of history stuff he wants to become a librarian so he's doing it's all pretty nerdy so if you're into that there you go that's fine uh he is a liberal shocking um I'm trying I'm trying to be positive here I'm trying to emulate the happy Pepe Reddit positivity where they were not even commenting about politics so you know what unbiased I do have a problem with this though Ryan says and I've seen this on a few different profiles as I was doing this very intense research because I am a cultural commentator I'm basically a social scientist at this point he wants a long-term relationship comma but he's open to Short why is that an option what does that mean that's just convoluted instead maybe this is my gripe with hinge just put open to anything I need to be touched can that be an option because that is what that screams to me it just feels desperate like why is this even an option like you're saying I want to settle down but also like I'll take anything please touch me I don't care again no it's just ridiculous other people are commenting on it though which I appreciate it and somebody goes how about long term open to short so then somebody replies this is actually fantastic he says Nope that literally reads I am seeking a long-term relationship but I'm open to hooking up think about how that relates to the opposite sex seeking long-term serious partners wow yes why would I waste my time why would any rational woman with any kind of self-respect waste their time if they are looking to build a life and you're clearly like I'll take anything I think that's my phrase now it's like no don't do that if you just want to hook up say you want to hook up if you want to find a long-term relationship do it but I'm also kind of in the Bank of hookup culture as toxic so I'm going to push you away from that if possible somebody said nope I am looking for somebody who wants the same thing as I do open to short is not much better than figuring out my dating goals yes gives the impression that they are desperate yes and not serious since they would accept a short-term relationship even if that's not their preference that is also that is such a good that yes it's like I am willing to compromise the things that probably deep down I know are important because I just I just need it and I want the attention and I'm desperate don't do that so for women don't waste your time on that for guys or for anybody work out your crap first figure out what you actually want what you are capable of taking on right now before you waste somebody else's time before you get on a dating app that that's my Common Sense advice I'm so thrilled with Reddit right now I can't even tell you these people are actually smart I thought that I was going to be the only one with brain cells here but the people that are actually in these threads replying it's good okay so most of these have been about men like it's a lot of men posting their profiles not as many women but also if you've read any of the research about women on dating apps most women don't really have a problem because the ratio of men to women on there is just absolutely ridiculous and women just get swiped on every single day like you get like 10 or 15 I don't know probably more than that matches a day and some guys are you know lucky to get one match a day a few a week that kind of thing because the studies say that men are willing to just swipe on any woman because they want to get as many matches they're you know they'll they're fine just doing whatever I'm doing the swiping motion but men are more likely to just do that while women are much more selective and so they will only like every few guys and so as a result the amount of matches especially for men is much much lower so as a result I think that's probably why guys are in these threads being like hey like could you help me spruce up my profile so I can get as many matches as possible I want to stand out which honestly is kind of wholesome and I hope everything works out for all of these men but I found a thread this is for women like I said because we gotta talk to the girls too because um there's so many problems with women in 2022 and I'm not even saying that to try to be a pick me girl it's just honest but there's a whole thread and it says what are you tired of seeing on dating apps and this is in our slash men so this is guys talking about other women uh on dating apps and this is why we're going to go back to the hiking and adventure thing men really have a problem with women saying that you want to go on adventures this guy says I like going on adventures lady my best friend took me on an adventure to check his [\u00a0__\u00a0] mail once I'm gonna need you to be more specific another person said when women say take me on adventures what is the Lord of the Rings are you trying to get some food um yeah there were a lot of them like that and to boil it down I think guys just wanted girls to be more specific I honestly think hiking is okay if you actually really like hiking maybe put a photo of it to show like hey I do like big outdoor stuff but if you're just setting an adventure again be more clear do you want to go get Taco Bell at 2 A.M is that an adventure or do you want a guy to pay for you to go on vacation or do you want to go rafting on the weekends again Precision efficiency Clarity that helps us all open communication that's just the Bedrock of any good relationship anyway uh my producer just jumped in and said I want to go on an adventure translates to I want you to spend money on me so if that is not the vibe that you want to give guys be more specific share about your hobbies uh this guy says My love language is sarcasm so it is for the this is just an incredibly long number basically 39 billion gazillion other profiles I saw is what he's saying and somebody replied and said Translate relation I'm accustomed to never taking responsibility for being a raging [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah that's also just such a cliche thing to say like I love sarcasm yeah most people do it's 2022. if you are in my generation or are a millennial you probably speak in either vines or memes or tick tocks our humor is drier our humor is darker and it's not a fun cute thing anymore maybe show off your humor and tell a joke or post a funny picture don't say I love sarcasm because most of the women honestly who do say that I go on record by saying that a lot of women think that they're funnier than they are that's just a fact um somebody said I will love my dog more than you I only swiped right because of your dog my dog is more important than anything dog moms are the urban horse girls and I avoid them like the plague okay well I can't get triggered here because then I'm gonna look awful but I I am a childhood horse girl so I do feel personally attacked I also do have two dogs that are basically my entire life however I do agree that like dog moms very weird I don't think I've ever called myself a dog mom I have a crusty white dog let me show you all a picture of Rocky it's my daughter to me I don't like baby my dogs they are pets I obviously love them and I take very good care of them but they are pets I also value people that are in my life and honestly there is this trend with Millennials where they're getting married or they're not getting married and not having kids and all they're doing is just getting copious amounts of labradoodles and I can say that because I do have a labradoodle and I have a smaller doodle as well that is not an adequate substitute for having a child for most people like I have dogs because I really enjoy them and I love dogs I love doing things with them I like hiking with them I love training them all of that I still want to have children I'm not going to be a dog mom so anyway I agree with that mostly even though I do kind of feel personally attacked because I will post photos of me and my dogs somebody says filters on photos anyone who does this deserves to be ghosted okay that's a bit much nobody likes to be ghosted unless you are a raging [\u00a0__\u00a0] and then goes on to say people on dating apps want to know what you look like not what you wish you looked like yes I think a casual visco filter everybody basically does that I think that's okay I have a problem with women and guys because I know that there are guys out that do it do not airbrush yourself you did not just do a photo shoot you are not going to be in a magazine this is a photo that you took on your iPhone from your night out last Friday down on Broadway in Nashville I can tell that you are airbrushed because your skin is porcelain and your eyes are like bright like Rudolph's nose like we all know don't do it show me what you actually look like I totally agree with this but I also disagree with the deserves to be ghosted that's just a bit much but on low maybe I'm too nice uh so he says star signs yeah the astrology stuff is just nobody cares I don't care you're a Gemini just people use this is just a totally different rant people use astrology as a way to excuse their bad behavior everybody's looking for excuses to excuse their bad behavior constantly in the society right now and I say this to somebody that is very interested in personality types and I've taken all of those quizzes you can literally watch them on my channel um I was raised according to my Myers-Briggs type but I've never used that as an excuse for me not being a good person or for things in my life I instead actually use it as like how do I get better or how do I interact with people that are different than me because obviously there are things that are very intrinsic about myself so if you're using it as a way to be a better person that's great but most people use it as like I'm gonna be lazy because it's my off day because my moon is in freaking Venus or whatever it's like no just you're just a tired lazy person okay another one I'm triggered by this one this guy says a Machu Picchu pick I have wanted to go to Machu Picchu since I was 10 when was I in fifth grade yeah when I was 10 I did a report in geography about Machu Picchu and it has been my dream destination ever since I was supposed to go to it when I graduated high school and then I think I was like shooting a TV show at the time which is like such a weird it's not trying to be a flex it's just like you know child actor stuff so I was not able to go and I immediately started college and then when I graduated it was covid and so I wasn't able to go and then I was working and I wanted to go with my mom and now she has a farm and it just never really happened but I desperately want to go and now I feel like I've you know made all of this hype around it and I hope it lives up to it but I want to do the Inca Trail I'm not going to take the tram up there I want to do the Inca Trail I want to see Machu Picchu I want to pet the alpacas and I will post a photo of it not on a dating app because they scare me but this is just maybe maybe the girl was really into Machu Picchu oh that's all I'm saying um and then also for the women I just want to wrap it up here because this just really spoke to me in a way that sounded weird but it's true this guy is just obviously very fed up and I hope it gives you some insight as to how men are feeling on this app where clearly they are outnumbered and it is not a fun time but this guy says why men shouldn't use dating apps here we go dating apps are a complete waste of time for the vast majority of men because it puts them at a severe disadvantage women get flooded with matches and messages while most men are lucky to get a few matches a day because of the unlimited options women on these apps are extremely flaky and have no problem discarding men like trash that is true I have seen awful things if I remember like my sorority sisters and people at UCLA it was just a hot mess all right continuing on many women are just there to boost their ego or grow their Instagram following yes okay that is another thing a lot of guys were talking about how women were saying like oh follow me on Instagram first don't no don't do that no that's very cringe let's see okay here we go 95 of the women you text on this app will flake or go ghost to you why put yourself through that kind of treatment have some self-respect my advice to all men using Tinder is to delete your account boss up grow your Social Circle and find ways to meet women in real life Tinder and other apps are a pseudo shortcut to getting I didn't read that part before and actually go out and meet women dating apps are nothing but a world of frustration and a cesspool of flakiness all right well that took a turn however I like this want number one it kind of makes me sad because I want these guys who are putting themselves out there to obviously succeed and this whole experience has taught me that these guys are really trying and people on Reddit they're all unifying regardless of you know political beliefs or you know interests gender basically to help each other uh but obviously something is not working and I like that this guy is not just complaining about it and saying like well you need to change it and like why whatever but he's saying you know what fine if it doesn't work go out into the real world man up and do it and honestly I really like it you have a point so put yourself out there work on yourself go listen to some Jordan Peterson if you are too afraid to go talk to a woman I'm sure he has some lecture that will teach you how to get out there and meet somebody just do not hide behind your phone if it is not working try something different like the world is not ending you don't have to just sit here texting girls all day there are other ways and women like I know some guys on these apps can be pigs that is a fact there will always be weird men we just saw Adam Levine literally cheating on his Victoria's Secret model wife obviously there are some pigs but don't be a [\u00a0__\u00a0] to the rest of them some of them are genuinely nice and are actually trying it's not that hard to be kind playing hard to get or acting like a crazy person on an app does nothing to help you don't be like this person whose name is your future ex-wife that's not cute she says men with cats just weird don't waste my time watching you chronologically age throughout your picks I will unmatch with you I like dark features and big muscles I want somebody who makes me feel safe protected and vulnerable with I love bald men tattoos are a huge plus I don't do kids or big dogs they slob are all over everything well educated come from an amazing family no I will not send nudes the only thing I like about this woman is that she's being upfront but why why the future ex-wife why are you so aggressive again the aggressive tone stop it like Samantha nobody cares at all calm down take it seriously if you don't take it seriously go to a bar I'm sure there's some bald tattooed man who would be happy to take you home that is what I've learned so guys if you actually need advice about dating shockingly I didn't think I would say this Reddit doesn't seem to be the worst place to go I can't believe I just said that but people were genuinely helpful I more had concerns with the people that were posting rather than the people who were helping and commenting like there seemed to be some good-hearted people out there who had your best interests at heart even when like guys were commenting on girls profiles and that sort of thing there was a huge weekly thread on the r slash Tinder subreddit where everybody puts their you know Tinder profiles for reviews like literally everybody was positive it was like Hey great start I really love this you should try that I'm genuinely weirded out right now but I kind of love it so if you need some help maybe Reddit is the place to go don't quote me on that I'm sorry if some weird person comes out of the woodwork because you know what it still is Reddit but uh that is my take on other people's online dating advice so I hope it works out for everybody before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribed to this Channel and ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "Ld93CjpLvV8": "there is another six weeks it is a manufactured sound designed to convince people that men have the right to write control of a woman's body away okay well that's all I take welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I have not talked about Stacy Abrams since the very very beginning of the show I actually think my episode about her saying some absolutely idiotic things is still one of my best performing videos because Stacy Abrams is just an easy person to dislike she's absolutely ridiculous she never stops Georgia would be better off if she would just leave but anyway Stacy Abrams is trending on Twitter she is back in the news for yet another idiotic statement but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection okay so Stacy was speaking at some political event last night and she was asked about abortion and she launched into an utter lie that I can't even describe so I'm just gonna have you watch this and I also want you to pay close attention to the people around her who are just mindlessly nodding their head affirming her like nobody wants to correct her and this is another lie so if you did not hear that correctly she just said there is no heartbeat at six weeks old what you hear in your ultrasound is just made up it's just some electronic activity which allows men to have control over women's bodies so it's just been designed by the patriarchy no it no doctors we're not sitting around going how can we control women let's make her think her baby's alive no that's just literally idiotic you have no sense of any kind of biology or science you are clearly just driven by a political agenda and if you did not see these people sitting around there like yeah there is no such thing do none of you have brain cells I think not you would have to be an idiot to believe anything Stacey Abrams is saying but you know if you do find yourself falling into one of her traps might I recommend boncharge boncharge's wide array of products helps you optimize your health they get your neurons firing they get your brain back firing on all cylinders so that you don't

spinning and the thing is very few people were trying to correct her or say that she was even remotely wrong which she is Twitter bump her to the top of the trending page and NPR and you know CSNBC we're saying oh nope she's right and so the little blurb under her trending page was like Stacy Abrams like says profound thing about abortion and you know NPR backs her up and then when you go to the trending page it's all these people going no she's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] so the left-wing media was not really doing a great job protecting her this time but it's not just her that is changing this narrative changing the science TM Planned Parenthood has also changed their tune as recent as two months ago on July 25th of this year this was their statement in the pregnancy week by week section of their website it says what happens in the second month of pregnancy you scroll down weeks five through six and it says a very basic Beating Heart and circulatory system develop Beating Heart circulatory system the child is alive and breathing I guess they figure that out you can see this in their website Archives this was published on Twitter a few people went and did deep Dives I saw multiple screenshots of this now when you go to the website this is my own screenshot what happens during week five to six a part of the embryo starts to show cardiac activity it sounds like a heartbeat on an ultrasound but it's it's not a fully formed heart it is the earliest stage of the heart developing so there just intentionally trying to make this incredibly confusing they're making it very clinical and like well it's not really that and it's just some electronic sounds but guys it is still cardiac activity they could have stopped after that first sentence and it would have meant the same thing corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture they're the same picture and if this correction is actually based on science and new research and you know God forbid Stacy Abrams is right when did the science change why wasn't there all of this noise about oh my God we just learned this crazy new thing about fetuses we're changing what we have thought for 50 years guys this is crazy the heart isn't developed we didn't hear about any of that they are just intentionally changing the rhetoric for a political agenda and this is not new for Planned Parenthood I talked about this in a couple of episodes ago but they used to have an entire page about ectopic pregnancies and verbatim they said the treatment for an ectopic pregnancy is not an abortion but after Roe v Wade was overturned and everybody started screenshotting that and referencing their own publication when the left started saying oh we need abortion for ectopic pregnancies they quickly scrubbed it from their website like it is totally gone this is something that they do on a weekly basis in order to try and stay ahead of the right wing narrative or whatever so I don't trust this I don't believe that the science has changed they are just intentionally making it confusing so that they have a better argument now coincidentally the same day that Stacy Abrams uh stepped into her role as a biologist and made this huge profound scientific discovery the mainstream media also came out with this objectively precious story here is the Today Show tweeting about it they said these images from researchers show that babies in the womb can possibly react to flavor but I thought that this was just a clump of cells that they couldn't feel pain in the midst of an abortion that they have no personhood that they are just a fetus that they cannot be called a baby until they come out of you but no people on The Today Show CBS News the guardian the New York Post and even CNN are excited and enthralled with how these cute little babies react to kale and carrots in the Today Show literally did an entire segment about it here it is some amazing baby faces look at this so researchers in Britain wanted to know if babies in the womb react when the mom ingests the flavor of food and this is what they saw do you want to guess what was on the left so the left is a baby in its resting state and then on the right you see how he smiles 20 minutes the mom made some carrots oh on the left with the there was just a resting seat that was arresting but you like the carrots she had like a carrot pill so were there other Foods yes there were other Foods I'm glad you asked you want to look at this Baby's reaction before that mom had mom had kale wow wow so here's the thing what about if Mama had ice cream I don't know why why would they go why would they go with Let Me Explain vegetables so the city's co-author says the images could just show muscle movements when a baby's reacting to maybe a flavor that's bitter so you shouldn't interpret it whether you know it's happy or distaste no I think that's how I do yeah because once they get out of the womb it's that same look yeah it's the same way yeah but it just goes to show you know what you ingest yeah you are what you eat and the 3D imagery is pretty cool they didn't have that when I was pregnant did you get three yeah I got 3D and at least honestly Ollie and Rusty look exactly like they do 3D images my kids had chalk drawings [Laughter] around talking about oh how cute this cute babies they're reacting to the things that the mother is ingesting so buy that logic guys what happens when the mother ingests an abortion pill to the babies to feel things then because if we're going to say that they can feel pain that they have emotions they can react to different flavors and experiences then obviously they can react to pain which by the way it has been scientifically determined that fetuses do feel pain even though people on the left obviously wish that you did not know that but I mean honestly the timing of these two stories could not be more perfect and everybody knows it because they are the perfect dichotomy people are replying to The Today Show video and saying babies in the womb screenshotting this for your next segment on abortion yes because immediately they're going to change their tune and go oh those just those cells those just lowly fetuses that don't have any personhood no just literally last week you were gushing over how realistic their faces looked another person said so it's a baby now but when you have an abortion it's just a clump of cells is that how it works if a person says hey Stacey Abrams you might want to look at this there you go another person said better delete this today show people might think that a fetus is a human being my God I mean really the left will try to come after this and shut down the story as quickly as possible because every time something new comes out scientifically about babies that you know ushers in a kind of emotional connection to them which shouldn't be very surprising because obviously if you are carrying a child you have an emotional connection to them but anytime we learn something new about what they can experience what they go through the left immediately tries to suppress it come out against it say no that science isn't right they can't feel anything or just straight up say we don't care which is even more horrifying but very indicative of their lack of any kind of moral compass this entire situation with these two stories is just an example of a perfect left-wing tactic I mean they are constantly changing words definitions and opinions so that it fits and supports their current narrative and their objective they're going to do everything in their power to try to prove that this Stacy Abrams heartbeat hoax is true and is objective science and reality and meanwhile they are most likely going to do everything in their power to suppress and try to debunk This research about babies in the womb being able to taste so they can continue on rationalizing their immoral disgusting behavior and that's just how they operate hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "ZNM1t6ovnJM": "[Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock uh today we're going to do another obviously an audience participation video because at this point I've done so many personality quizzes I think you guys know me better than I know myself at this point so I like these you know ones where you guys send in comments because I get to know you guys a little better and I get to laugh and it's just fully entertaining to me so I appreciate you guys sending in things um we're going to talk about our weird habits today and I know that I have some but being in my own shoes it was difficult for me to think of some so I literally texted my mom texted a bunch of my friends I asked Madison the other day and I was like what are my weird habits and they were sending me things that in my mind I was like like what do you mean it's a weird habit that's pretty normal like for example when I take a shower I can't just like towel off and move on with the rest of my day I have to sit in my towel and get in my bed for like 10 minutes my mom does this too so you can think that both of us are weird it's like a little Cocoon of like warmth and I have to do that doesn't matter what time of day it is it's like I need that so I guess that's kind of weird um I also can ever finish a drink and I talked about that in another off the clock video that's coming out I will order a coffee and I'll drink half of it and then the ice will melt or it'll get soggy and I'll go I don't want it I'll move on like I just don't drink things fast enough the same thing will happen if I'm like out and I get half a drink and I'm like okay well that's it I also speaking of going out I often asked to do things and I rally people up to get excited like hey guys I really want to go do this and then I get there and I realized it was a terrible mistake not because I've gotten us into an awful situation but I get there and I'm like why am I not at home or why am I not you know doing something else like with movies I will ask to have a movie night I'm like I want to watch this five minutes in I'm asleep without fail like I I don't know what it is I would like to be some movie connoisseur I cannot stay awake for the life of me if I get my friends to go out I'm like come on guys Friday night we gotta go we're hitting hitting the town five minutes in I'm like sitting in a corner like this is the worst mistake of my life why am I here maybe it's me projecting wanting to be more out there and do these things maybe for other people and then I realize that it's not what I want to do but I would say that's a weird habit because it happens repeatedly and like another one that I don't think is weird but I think half of the country thinks is weird is I put ketchup on my eggs which I don't think that's a weird habit but I have been at breakfast with people I've been at Waffle House and I'm like putting ketchup on my egg scramble and they're like oh God look you're a freak like no it just tastes good I just don't like eggs in general they need a little ketchup flavor but anyway enough about me I'm sure that reading some of yours will jog my mind maybe I'll read yours and realize oh my God I literally am a freak um so we'll see um so some person said I always talk to myself when I'm alone especially if I'm on a walk make up scenarios plan conversations sing Etc I don't think that's weird I have fake arguments in the shower all the time it's like if I have you know had an argument with somebody and I feel like I lost it or I didn't do it well enough like I will Envision how I could have won that and I will act it out so I don't think that's weird no not at all I forget to peel the banana before eating it okay well that feels like a one-time thing how is that a habit do you need glasses that cannot taste good um Joel said I always wait three weeks to put away laundry okay yes my God maybe these are all of my habits I oh God I don't mind doing laundry I like the art the art of you know moving it from the washer to the dryer taking it out I hate folding it I hate folding laundry with a burning fashion so much so that my cleaning lady who comes every other week she'll like sweep the floors my main priority for her is like can you please fold my laundry like I'll have like I hate it that much that is such a first world thing but I I despise it I will do other people's as an act of service and an act of Love Like if I go over to my friend's house and I see if they have a hamper I try to be useful and I start folding my own laundry absolutely not it's like it sits in that hamper forever so if you ever wonder why when I'm out and about my clothes are wrinkly it's because it's been sitting in the hamper just saying the king of the clown says I have a weird habit of sniffing pencils I know if I sniff pencils two of my closest friends need to sniff every piece of Leather and Shoe and like I get like a new leather bag I want to sniff it but like a pair of tennis shoes they're like oh I'm like oh God are you doing drugs or something anyway I don't think I've ever sniffed a pencil I'll try it I'll let you know um vcg cosplay says so mine is I'll work on a project and get 80 to 90 done and move on to another I have procrastination moments but I end up piling on projects mine is kind of the opposite I will push off projects until the very end and then I'll get them all done in one sitting that is my worst nightmare having things half done anxiety-inducing on the myers-brig scale you're probably a p then I'm a j which means I need to get things done like if I start something I have to finish it but I will push it off until the very last minute and then the adrenaline gets me to finish it oh God okay somebody says picking my lip I've probably shed more blood now than I will my whole life picking my lip Okay I don't pick my lip but I do chew my cheek but I don't know that's kind of a it doesn't like if I'm nervous or stressed I will bite it and then it like creates a sore I know this is so gross I'm so sorry if anybody else does this you can let me know um but I will often get them inside like if I accidentally bite my cheek or my tongue when I'm eating and then it's there and then I freak out and I start chewing it it's not great it's not good my weirdest habit is I have to re-stuff or repack my pillows before I can go to sleep otherwise I toss and I turn until I do that I don't think I've ever I mean I guess I will fluff them I won't repack them but I'll like shake them out a little bit get the cold side but I also know that I'm not a calm sleeper my mom uh once called me a Floppy Fish not once she called me my entire childhood a Floppy Fish because I would go from like side to side of the bed kick things I would wake up and my head would be down at the foot of the bed I have to have like a cavern of pillows around me hugging all sides of them so it doesn't really matter if they're fluffed perfectly because I'm gonna destroy them all eventually um but I do get that okay you asked for it not super weird but I count ceiling tiles everywhere in the room I can't help myself other things that I count that seems satisfying I hate numbers so I don't think I would count things but I get the appeal of that I was always somebody and I think I still do this now if I see like a pattern on the floor like with tiles I will still at 20 years of age like Bounce from them be like ooh can't step on the Square and not make it like a game but I will just see myself just kind of like step over like squares or whatever I don't know I hadn't thought about that in a while I wonder when the last time I did that was I don't know um picking things up with my feet and toes well I mean listen there are people that you know promote grounding and like not wearing shoes all of that stuff which is actually probably very healthy for you because it's going back to our Primal roots and they do say that you need to like exercise your toes in a way and like be able to pick things up so I mean maybe not that weird maybe you're just ahead of all of us because we have our feet like crammed into these shoes and you're just ahead so when the apocalypse happens and we can't order Converse anymore you're gonna be running around Barefoot and able to use multiple limbs I don't know this is you just going back to your anthropological roots maybe we'll just say that way um that I subconsciously flare my nostrils when I'm deeply concentrated on something I mean that's kind of awesome it's like don't talk to me I'm on fire I don't know it's kind of a good way to get people off your back this guy says biting my nails at age 59. listen I just now stopped biting my nails I pick at them a lot which like right now I don't have my nails done which is honestly how I like it but since doing this show and like being on camera more often I have been getting them done pretty regularly because I pick it's like my nervous habit I don't chew anymore I got rid of that but I pick all around them I'll peel them because I really brittle nails that's a weird thing I'll peel my nails I don't chew them but I peel them oh I should go get my nails done um I just haven't been to get a manicure in a while now because I've been busy and lazy um but that's why that's literally why I get manicures is because having like an extension on or some kind of acrylic it keeps me from being able to do that so sir maybe you should get a manicure that's my advice to you um somebody said sleeping in my work clothes I've done that before I remember when I was working at Trader Joe's and we had really early shifts like in covid we had people come in at 3am I would often work 5 a.m shifts it was actually my favorite shift because I would get out of there super early and have the rest of my day um but on my really really early morning ones I would sleep literally in my like Trader Joe's hoodie and my jeans would get up put on my shoes and walk out the door so I don't think it's that crazy I'm also not somebody that gets super weirded out of having like your daytime clothes in bed in a way I know that there are people that are like I don't want like dirty clothes in my bed I I'm like as far from a germaphobe as you can get so this doesn't seem weird to me because if you've had a hard day if you worked a long time sometimes you just want to crash that's okay so he said I have to have YouTube playing in the background if I'm ever doing anything around the house I cannot clean or work in silence same except music and it will always be the three songs that I have on repeat in that week because I go through Cycles I'm kind of getting tired of the ones I'm listening to right now I need to find some other free ones I'm gonna have on rotation um but yeah I can't I overthink so much I cannot be with my own thoughts eating the skin off my finger sometimes it starts bleeding not good again that's with my like picking and peeling I don't think I've made it bleed but I do like sit and I'll do like this that kind of nothing again manicure cuticle oil that helped me a lot of cuticle oil curling the corners of my papers my papers look like a freaking scroll when I'm done with it I don't really think I do that but I do have some weird habits when I'm reading because I feel like I need to keep my hands busy and so I would always like flip pages down draw I would all oh my God I would flip uh if it was a paperback would flip the book over and like Break um break the binding and that sort of stuff it pissed my dad off my dad has this huge rare book collection he is like a traditionalist and you know use a bookmarked well of that and I was like the kid reading upside down ripping out Pages like that kind of thing and a bunch of my books are like twisted like that just because that's how I read so I get that 100 another person said I use almost every pan in the pot while cooking and don't clean them until the next day I also don't let anyone in the kitchen while cooking um that's a pretty normal thing I like having people around because I feel like cooking is a very social thing but growing up my mom always had this kind of unspoken rule I guess I actually was kind of spoken that if you were not going to be in the kitchen helping her actively cooking you needed to be like sitting behind the counter sitting whatever and I always hated that because with the people that I'm very close to physical touch is very important to me and so I would literally be standing behind her while she's like sauteing something like holding on to her like so what do you do today she's like get off of me I've tried to cook um I don't mind as much just because I like people being around me and I think it's really social um so I don't mind it at all my weird thing with like pots and pans and like cleaning and that sort of thing I will clean stuff up I've gotten to I've gotten into a rhythm where I do clean right after cooking which is good my mom did teach me that I will not unload the dishwasher until I have to put new things in it this is kind of like with the folding laundry thing it's like I don't want to do the last step in cleaning it's like I made it that far like it's already clean I'll just take the plate out of the dishwasher I don't know um I'm a little OCD when I grocery shop I have to get the third item back on the Shelf if there isn't one I can bring myself to buy it for produce yes because usually they put the fresher stuff in the back but honestly guys you always need to look at the date because again work to Trader Joe's if like we were in a rush sometimes the produce would not get rotated properly and so we would just like cram the newer stuff in the front so maybe you did luck out it's so just always look at the dates so that isn't totally crazy for me it isn't really a big deal in my mind with you know shelf stable stuff but hey if you get into the pattern of doing it with produce it makes sense you would take that uh into you know the pantry stuff somebody said if it's too quiet I make a random noise I hate it when it's overly quiet it stresses me out it stresses me out feels like something's wrong so understood I stroke my arm very lightly to get a tingle no comment that reminds me of do you guys remember that thing you do in elementary school probably if you're my age or a little older where it was like you do it on people's back and you go Around the World in 80 Days x marks the spot comment question mark spider crawling up your back getting ready to like attacking you do like tight squeeze Cool Breeze now you got the chills I was like super into that but I've never done I don't think this like does anything I don't know that was weird but you do you sir Whatever Gets you happy um somebody said I always make match steps to the Cadence of the breaks in the sidewalk or the pattern on the floor that's what I was saying before of like stepping in the tile and that sort of thing yes I 100 do that also if I am walking with somebody I hate being out of rhythm like I will look at whoever I'm walking with and match the Cadence even if they are like a foot taller than me I will step the hell out and I will move because I it weirds me out if I look down and it's like whatever I want to be in Rhythm probably because when I'm out and I would go on walks growing up we would always do the like left left left right left like I left my wife and 43 children and nothing but gingerbread left that whole thing um so that's probably why um Bobby's laughing at me I used to love that I haven't thought about that in so long sometimes I pour milk before the cereal you Heathen look at that emoji that you put you knew that you were wrong no I don't really care that's kind of in the same vein as the ketchup on eggs like and pineapple on Pizza those are the real questions dividing this country to be honest uh somebody said weirdest habit is that I have to place the corner of my pillow between my pointer and middle finger to sleep this listen I'll try that tonight and I'll get back to you I don't understand like physically what that's supposed to do but I love it for you if you're getting sleep if you're getting your eight hours do what you got to do um from ages 12 to 22 I chewed on water bottle caps I chew on my straw still 100 uh oh did anybody else ever chew on DVD cases nope like I would sit watching I Love Lucy I was like an eight-year-old gnawing on the DVD cases that is so disgusting but something about it tasted good I don't know maybe it's what kept me awake while I was watching things because like I said fall asleep five minutes in um eat the starburst with the paper I'm sorry Zach that nope not no no that just sounds like stomach issues up the Wazoo my friend why that's all all I'm asking is why is there some do you like the crunch we can get you things that have a crunch that are not gonna destroy your intestines um somebody said I have to run out of the restroom before the toilet flushes else I feel like a monster is going to get me is it like a toilet plumber monster we're reaching up um I've never had that with bathrooms but it reminds me the house I grew up in in Chattanooga it was interesting because it was super long it was all one level and the rooms were huge and so it wasn't like oh you had a long hallway and there'd be a room on this side whatever it was just like bedroom bedroom bedroom living room family room uh dining room kitchen whatever and my parents bedroom was on the complete opposite side of the house from the rest of the bedrooms like there was a bedroom wing and then there was like the master bedroom all the way down there I would go say good night to my mom at the other end of this big ass like long house the lights would turn off and my God I would Sprint all the way down to my bedroom that was on the complete opposite end of the house because I was convinced that a monster was gonna pop out of one of those big ass rooms under a cabinet or something and take me and the complicated part is that there were dog gates in different parts of the house and so I would have to run rattle the thing jump through it anyway that was a whole ordeal I don't know when I stopped doing that probably when we left that house and then I just didn't have a reason to anymore but it was appalling Dylan said I eat my food in order of taste eat the worst first and save the best to last so Bobby pointed this one out and he was like oh I do that too so everybody now knows Bobby's weird habit maybe this is your undercover Tick Tock account of you exposing your weird habits I don't think I do that but I was somebody that never wanted to mix my food now I don't really care and I'll literally make a mush pile um I don't think I've ever I'll have to go to a restaurant and see if I do that um this is funny I'm exposing one of my really good friends right now but this is her weird habit it reminds me of it the way I love you Addie the way that she picks out what to get at a restaurant is she goes to the menu item by item and goes nope nope nope nope maybe nope nope nope nope nope until she gets to one that she's like okay yeah I'll get literally goes through line by line until she figures out something that she doesn't hate again that's not me and it's not exactly in the same thing but it revolves around food so there you go I will try to think of some more weird habits once my friends get back to me because I know that I have some because I relate to this I appreciate that you guys are self-aware enough to go oh maybe that's weird because in my mind it's probably just me being overconfident I'm like none of this is weird like everybody does this like no Brett they don't um so when this video comes out maybe I'll drop some of those in the comments and you guys can see I'll really expose myself there uh but thank you as always for sending these in I love getting to know you guys a little bit better um it just makes this whole thing much more fun so I will see you next time before you go make sure that you like

every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "W-7HJrICBIE": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper i'm warning you in advance this one is a bit of a weird one not even weird that is too soft of a word this is criminal it's disgusting we're going to be talking about some trans children but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already to check out the first capsule of my merch collection you can go to dailywire.com brett and as always make sure that you have that notification bell hit so you never miss a comment section episode because as depressing as it is there are a lot of stories out there like this these days and i'm gonna be talking about all of them so i don't want you to miss any of it the worst trade deal ever made i first saw this story after redux magazine read an article about it they are a fantastic publication by the way go check them out especially if you're a woman i love their articles they tweeted out and said the world's youngest transgender model ten-year-old noella mcmahor comes from a predominantly transgender household and is the child of a professional trans activist my god i can't believe that's a career mcmahon allegedly came out at two and is set to have gender surgeries at 16. so i saw this article and then i connected the dots because i had seen a video going around of this little girl looking human walking on a runway so this is noella walking in new york fashion week noella doesn't look happy by any means but again it's modeling none of them look happy the music really throws me off because i want to be like oh yeah i like this this is a groove and then i'm like brett no there is a transgender 10 year old walking in front of you but did not just become trans by themselves considering that their parents are both trans and trans activists there's another video this is another runway walk here we go noella strutting we got the blue hair starting young oh sass pop that hip okay oh my god all right i just i gotta leave okay we just started come on man listen listen there's a lot to see in this life not wasting it here i saw a couple of tweets people saying why do parents even put their kids in modeling like this even if it's not a trans kid like what is this it's the money and attention i can tell you that right now i don't get it it's weird that's why this is the article redux wrote a 10 year old child is making headlines as the world's youngest trans model to walk the runway at new york fashion week uh they were representing trans clothing company brand it's apparently a clothing company that's specifically designed for trans people but just fine you know find a need in the market i guess a child was a model at new york fashion week in february the child's story has begun to receive additional media attention after it was announced that the 10 year old has been signed on for modeling gigs until november so really career's just taking off at this point noella's mother stated uh that at age two noella would refuse to wear boy clothes and have tantrums because she was so young she knew what she wanted but she didn't have the words to say it i should have known earlier that she hated anything masculine so i brought her to a gender clinic the most sinister part of this entire quote is she knew what she wanted but didn't have the words to say it no you knew what you wanted and your child does not have the vocabulary or the mental capacity to understand what is going on and so noella is just going along with your weird agenda a two-year-old does not know that it is a different gender i will die on that hill it is just creepy and it is weird to assume that they do so noella came out at age two but then by age four had socially transitioned meaning that everybody around noella and noella herself herself was apparently using she her pronouns the family also says that noella will undergo gender surgeries at age 16. but prior to that we'll already go ahead and start doing hormone therapy what is up with everything in this world being pumped with hormones and these puberty blockers like from children to our food that is why i love good ranchers because they don't pump their meat full of hormones like this as you probably know by now good ranchers is my very favorite meat delivery service and not only are their products incredible but they are also super based and have amazing values and this august they are on a mission to donate 100 meals to children in need in this back-to-school season and i want to help them out so i am offering 10 viewers the chance to come hang out with me over zoom for 30 minutes on september 29th we can cook steak hang out i'll answer your questions all you have to do to be eligible is go to goodranchers.com cooper and buy a box of meat using my code cooper you'll get 30 off of your order free shipping and you'll be entered into this exclusive meet and greet giveaway see what i did there i'm so good at puns anyway back to people who are pumping living beings with hormones somebody commented on the video and said children need to be happier than this i mean look this is a 10 year old child wearing full makeup doing the like sexy slicked back hair thing full false eyelashes and strutting on a runway and obviously you know models are taught to do like the um you know that kind of face but it's a kid masquerading as some kind of freaky adult this should make you uncomfortable somebody else said i wonder if children born to blind parents want to cut out their eyes by age 16. i was going to make a joke about it but then i realized that there is such a thing as trans-abled people who are trying to make themselves disabled because they feel like they should be born disabled so basically the options are endless in 2022. the other person said they didn't have a child they had a political statement yes and it makes complete sense because both of the parents are biological women who are trans men and they are trans activists this is literally part of an entire charade i guarantee it sometimes i think i'm bad at this parenting thing then i see something like this and i'm reminded that i'm not doing that at all i kind of like leaving you on this note because it's positive and if you are not raising your child like this if you are protecting them and you know just letting them go out playing a sandbox touch grass you're probably doing okay give them a couple of books i promise things will be okay but of course i'm not actually going to leave you on that happy note because there is more i don't want to live on this planet anymore let's talk about the parents here they are uh this person tweeted out and said a picture paints a thousand words there they are somebody replied and said looks like noella's choices are pretty limited scrub that what are her terms of reference does she even have a choice to transparency who work in transactivism social contagion much i mean this needs to be in a psychology textbook when we are discussing nurture versus nature in 30 years i feel like we're going to look back realize how grotesque all of this was we were literally chopping off body parts sterilizing children and we're going to have that conversation it's going to be way too late i fear but hopefully at some point but obviously not everybody has the same opinion as me because these parents even had an advice article written about them in chicago parents where they talked about raising queer children here's some of it this is when noella was seven they said seven-year-old stands up for transgender rights and in literally the second line they write noella ella mccord is one of illinois's biggest transgender rights advocates at just seven assigned mail at birth ella socially transitioned to female at four and a half and legally transitioned at six legally alright so came out at two socially at four what does it mean legally transition at six did these parents literally go and change the gender on birth certificates like the kid doesn't even have an id what does that mean you cannot be a transgender advocate at seven years old that is the parent it's like the phrase like there are no vegan dogs it's the owners doing it same thing no it isn't we taught a lion to eat tofu anyway the article continues on telling noella's story the parents are giving advice about raising a transgender child and then this little phrase stood out to me they're talking about how ella had a rough go at life and all of this stuff and then the line is it wasn't until she visited the gender development clinic at ann and robert h lurie children's hospital of chicago that things began to change i wonder why considering that we were just watching all those videos last week of doctors saying oh well if if a little girl doesn't want to wear a dress that probably means she's transgender and then they can go into our pediatric transgender unit and get a hysterectomy because the little girl wanted to chop off her hair it's just sinister it is so creepy from that day forward the pronouns became she and her and the family never looked back i don't think the parents were looking back ever i think they were looking forward at a progressive political statement the biological father is out of the picture the redux article did a good job kind of describing the story behind all of that but i think it is the most complicated part of the story the two women gay lesbian parents trans masculine whatever have claimed that the biological father was abusive and a few years ago he was even arrested for that after he allegedly fractured noella's arm while trying to put her in boy's clothing already seeming a bit fishy i don't know now the layer under those allegations is that the custody battle began way before that when the father opposed and actively fought against noella transitioning into being a female at age two obviously now if the man is actually abusive then he has serious problems and that is something that should never be excused it's disgusting and i would appreciate him being arrested however i cannot ignore my thought that maybe this was blown out of proportion in order to villainize him to allow the women to get full custody and get him out of the child's life because he opposed their agenda and i hate that that is where my mind goes but that is the world that we live in these people will go to any length to push this agenda forward and because of stories like this parents being afraid to speak out against all of this is understandable they don't want to lose custody of their kids that's not something that is just happening in canada no it's happening here in michigan in california there are countless stories just like this one of parents losing custody after they have opposed transitioning but even though that is understandable and it is a valid fear speaking up is necessary be a parent protect your kids protect other people's kids who are not speaking up but final thing the common sense people of the world have obviously picked up the story and are talking about it a lot but it is still floating around the left-wing universe and it is getting ratioed like crazy which is obviously making me very happy so we're gonna end on that note because i think it's a bit of a white pill lgbtq nation which is a crazy publication tweeted out and said ten-year-old girl is the youngest trans model to walk new york runway posts a picture of noella but let's just look at that ratio 64 likes 389 replies and 257 retweets which are all quote tweets of people saying you are disgusting just beautiful somebody replied and said tying the lgb community to this does them absolutely no favors knock it off agreed there's a reason why the twitter account and the movement gaze against groomers is getting so much traction because so many people who have a brain are going hey like we don't we don't want to be associated with this we don't agree because it's sterilizing children somebody else said i'm encouraged by the total ratio good job tweeters exactly my thought another person said this is how you lose people this isn't progress again kind of same rationale as the first comment but just in general all of these replies all the quote tweets they are encouraging people are waking up so even though we are seeing a ton of stories like these i still believe that this is one radical one percent of the population and even though that is a very small number their power is incredible they're instilling fear into everybody they are making everyone around them bend a knee to their sick agenda but they are still one percent we still have a chance that's why matt walsh was tweeting out the other day that he is optimistic that we can fight against this because they are crazy and they are so small people just have to stand up guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "pZ45i2odWd4": "welcome back to the comment section bonus content if that makes sense i'm brad cooper but you guys all know that by now there are almost 800 000 of you here which is absolutely wild and mind-boggling and i do feel like we have cultivated a sort of community feels very familial i think we're all very friendly i interact with a bunch of you especially on like twitter and that sort of thing but i feel like we could be closer and the best way to get close to people is to share embarrassing stories so i posted on all of the platforms that you guys should send in some of your most embarrassing stories i promised that they would stay anonymous when i do this video and i appreciate you all trusting me with these stories because y'all are wild and we're gonna get into it but to level the playing field i obviously need to share one of my own and when i posted this on instagram i told one about how my pants fell down in the middle of an indian buffet so i won't retell that one um but when i was gosh 11 years old see this even feels like i don't know if this is too old to be doing this but i was in a musical i was in gypsy and i was a myriad of different characters but i started the show being like a balloon girl if you know this musical then it makes sense if not just hang with me anyway i was covered in balloons doing like a little tap dance because it's supposed to be like vaudeville again if you're a theater nerd you get this anyway um i needed to go to the bathroom before the show started and there were a bunch of other kids in the show and they were all running around like hoodlums taking up time in the bathroom one like locked himself in there at one point all the other bathrooms were full and i would like had to be on stage like the curtain was about to go up so i just ran out there and like i had never had to go to the bathroom so bad in my entire life and i stood up there in my outfit covered in balloons i have a photo of it and i should i should put it into this uh video and i sat up there and i was doing my little tap dance number and i almost made it through and then i had to like pause and like hold a pose and i peed everywhere like thankfully thankfully didn't go everywhere because i was in like tights so it was kind of contained but that was the most probably horrific moment of my life my mother didn't know about that for years thankfully i don't think it was visible but it was so upsetting i went into the bathroom after that and cried i think that is the most embarrassing thing that i did on stage apparently when i was like six years old i was also in a musical and i sat on stage during one of the really big numbers and just sat and like picked my nose and stared at the back of the audience so i've i've just i've made a fool of myself time and time again i'm very okay with that i think that it's good to have some self-deprecating humor so that is what we're gonna do in this video i'm going to laugh with you at these stories so um to get us started we're gonna start with some of the comments this is from tick tock this person says again keeping it anonymous i went to a strip club for the first time with some friends after a big promotion and the first dancer on stage was my cousin i ran out in horror were you in alabama isn't that that a whole tick tock trend where it's like sweetheart alabama cause you know and whatever okay well that's horrific i'm so sorry i've never been to a strip club and i i don't have any desire to also all of my producers are here today so they are all laughing with us not at you with you um let's see okay um oh no i grew up pretty boring for halloween i was forced to dress up like as a construction worker but i later found out it was my dad's work clothes oh that's like sad but also that's very endearing in a way that's very sweet you know i'm sure you look really cute and hard at okay um oh no one thing that i did notice as we were compiling these a lot of you guys should your pants i have not yet i guess because apparently this happens a lot somebody says i craft myself in a dentist's chair because i was allergic to something they used i don't know how that happens but that's really unfortunate uh i don't know the correlation of that but okay um this person says i got my head stuck in a chair at a chinese restaurant uh that feels very reminiscent of my pants falling down at the indian buffet apparently very bad things happen at these restaurants this person says lived with my grandparents a long time ago after showering i was walking back to my room my grandma stopped to hug me and then my towel fell hmm yeah that's any time that you see or that your family sees any part um it's just like i don't really want to at all i don't want to get into that all right here's a longer one i worked in a grocery store at a cashier one day a customer complained to my manager that i never make conversation with my clients so my manager ordered me to do so therefore i began greeting my customers and asking how is your day going since i didn't speak any english at all i only responded with answers like good or that's great and i paid no attention whatsoever to their answers because mainly it was only small talk besides i wanted to scan the items as fast as i could in order to advance customer line to be a good employee very valid however one day a customer came to me she was a lady mid 50s american as usual i asked her how is her day going and i began to scan her items as fast as i could while she was telling me her story i just kept saying good that's good awesome but then when i was about to finish she interrupted me and she said why is that good i just told you that i lost my house my mom is in the hospital and i'm going through a divorce oh god that feels like something straight out of some kind of sitcom but though like gross small talk that you do make as a cashier it is so real and you just kind of have to sit there and smile at them and i swear when i worked at trader joe's i feel like every person thought that i was flirting with them but i genuinely just wanted them to keep talking so that i could focus on like doing my work so i was like uh-huh like wink smile none of it really means anything so i'm sure it's fine although that is hysterical oh no so this one was from my instagram this person said i asked my college rabbi how active is the bdsm community on campus i meant to say bds um well that's that's uncomfortable i hope he prayed for you um the time that i threw up in front of a group of elderly at a nursing home while i was singing a christmas carol how drunk were you at the nursing home did you like play drunk bingo with all the old ladies was this a margaritaville it's probably margaritaville when i retire i'm moving into a margaritaville i hope you all know that um okay i actually know i actually know the man who submitted this and i love you but i tried to fart and make my girlfriend laugh but i my pants on an escalator in macy's in new york city um that's better than the the cringe couples making out on escalators i don't know about you guys but that probably is one of the most embarrassing things ever it is so cringy like i love love puppy love so cute happy for you why are you making out in the mall like this story is at least more entertaining i let out a silent fart in public i forgot my hearing aids were not i'm deaf it wasn't silent oh i guess all farts are silent to you which must be great imagine how horrifying that would be to be deaf and you don't know that somebody's farting but suddenly it just smells awful and you just have no concept of knowing what it is or like hearing somebody rip a fart honestly i do kind of understand that in a way because my dog will like be under my bed and i won't hear him it'll just stink ah no no no no she's fine it's my like 14 year old lab it is he also in his old age and in this like very warm summer heat he likes to sleep on the vents and he farts every five minutes maybe and someone just um my house is a lovely place i burn candles everywhere because of that uh let's see uh somebody said nothing is embarrassing as you not being able to ride a bike this wasn't supposed to be attacking me thank you very much this is supposed to be all of us laughing together at everyone else but it's true but it's true and you know what i ca like i can ride in a straight line so give me some credit i just get nervous when there are people around all right uh for the most embarrassing story this is a longer one i'm an aesthetician new to the field and on my first day of working i was training on a client with my boss i was super nervous and i tripped over a lamp card which was by the bed that the client lays on the lamp fell onto the client so i had to pick it up and i was trying to plug the cord back into the attachment on the lamp at the bottom and i wasn't paying attention to what i was doing so while trying to fix it i smacked my boss in the face with the lamp so yes my first day training on a client and i knocked over a layup onto them and then proceeded to smack my boss in the face with the layup while trying to fix it that's a lot but you know what i would probably prefer that to happen because i kind of hate going to the esthetician because i know that my face is going to be burning for the next week so if all of that happened i would probably be more entertained more of that should happen at doctor's offices to lighten the mood to be honest um this is good my embarrassing story i used to be a democrat happy ending though i woke up there were a lot of those i saw a bunch of comments of people being like okay this is really embarrassing i voted for biden i voted for a democrat what once whatever i'm glad that everybody knows that that's embarrassing no i really don't care but that's funny um when i was four my dad and i went to quick trip and i got in the car and then i realized it was the wrong car the family looked at me and i was frozen solid uh i've never done that but i definitely i can be a bit distracted especially when i was younger and i would think that a lot of people were my mother who were not my mother and so i would run up to them grab onto them that kind of thing i'm also very clingy when it comes to my mom and my family and so i would just kind of like latch on and then realize that it was like some random woman named deborah and not diane so that's happened before um i was drunk and i pissed while sitting in a car threw the jeans on the sidewalk and a hobo bore them after what the hell good god um that sounds like something out of like a bad breaking bad like hbo show thing that shouldn't be a comedy but it is um i also know this person why do i know so many people who have crafted their pants um my junior year of high school i sneezed at a new year's party and then i shat my pants uh apparently what i'm learning from this is all of us need to be wearing adult diapers apparently yeah in addition to biden biden first and foremost because you guys know he farted in front of the queen wasn't that a whole thing that he farted in front of the queen or he shat in front of some royal family i don't know if that was a rumor or an actual thing but i choose to believe that it's true i have not cracked my pants i would be honest if i had but i have not so i wouldn't be able to tell you in the comments if you have been one of these adult crappers let us know maybe it's maybe it's youthful euphoria in a way um possum got into an old plastic trash can my dad was holding it while i grabbed the 22 and shot it i almost blew my dad's toe straight off listen that doesn't seem that embarrassing that just seems kind of epic and if your dad did lose a toe it would be a funny story um when i was younger i poured gasoline over an open fire because i thought the fire was dying out i'm glad the whole house didn't burn down uh i have never done that although i did burn my feet because i put my foot up against the side of a fire pit that was going crazy that's my only like fire story i don't really have anything that's exciting oh my god no i do have a fire story holy crap i was set on fire as a child i forgot that that wasn't embarrassing on my part that was just bad on my brothers it was fourth of july i was strapped into my kitty swing and i was wearing a ruffled dress my brothers were like here let's give the toddler the sparklers i go ooh sparklers and i go up in flames and then i had to be like drenched in the sink so that is that is probably is my best fire story i can always say that my older brother set me on fire um this person says i thought i saw a friend of mine in public so i ran over and punched them in the arm i quickly realized it was a very scared and confused woman i apologized and ran away i wonder if she still thinks about the time she was randomly assaulted and the guy ran away i do wonder what that feels like it's like is it impractical jokers or something like that because you obviously like didn't assault her but if it was like a a and then like ran away she was an old woman she's probably still bruised from that to be honest maybe it was assault who knows um tenacious d concert made it to the front and was super excited then i my pants just when the concert started did nothing about it okay with i don't know who tenacious d is is it worth standing there with poop in your pants i'm so concerned for all of you i'm buying everyone in my audience adult diapers that's what i've learned you know i haven't done a merge drop yet maybe the first one should just be in the comment section all right there we go okay one time i was at the gym on the treadmill and i pooped and it went everywhere what do you mean it went everywhere i'm imagining like a man in like short running shorts and it's just like oh god i'm wheezing okay moving on i don't think this one has poop involved all right here we go i had just gotten a new galaxy watch and received a call from my sister when i was in the shower my phone was sitting on the floor outside of the shower so i answered on my watch after talking for a couple of minutes turned off the shower and pulled back the curtain to find that i had in fact answered a video call from my sister she saw everything so my question is why didn't she tell you for a couple of minutes if that ended my brother i would have been like dear god put it away i don't want to see it she's a good sport i don't know maybe she was just trying to be nice and like save you from humiliation apparently it didn't work oh i accidentally crashed a truck into the uga football locker room in the middle of a game you know we needed to ask about this gracie if this actually happened uh she would know she knows everything about uga the woman who created this set and she helps me with all the tick tocks she runs like all of our tick tock stuff um the biggest uga football fan you will ever meet so i'm sure she knows this i'll have to get the details on the story uh this person says i was in the fourth grade and i accidentally stepped on an open sewage pipe during recess and the crap covered my leg from foot to knee they gave me the day off i would hope they gave you the day off that's horrifying that's better than you pooping your pants though i will say stepping in somebody else's actually no no i would rather be my own okay how did this turn into this all right here we go oh no you not responding to my promposal i'm so sorry i do feel like i did i did see during prom season i was tagged at a bunch of stuff that it's like if this gets how many likes likes can i take you to prom or like brett cooper go to promptly whatever i'm very sorry that i did not take you up on that i hope that that was not actually embarrassing um and if so i genuinely apologize maybe i should have taken you up on it because i never actually went to a prom should that be a video brett goes to a prom because i never did i went to i went to multiple homecomings interesting experiences but i never went to a prom and my mom always said because i was homeschooled she desperately wanted me to go because she felt like it was an experience that i should and i had some offers but i just kind of was ambivalent about it i really didn't care about any of the traditional high school stuff um one because i had to stick up my ass into i was just like busy and i didn't care um so maybe i should actually go to a prom next year promposal 2.0 maybe i'll be there can't make any promises but maybe i'll be there okay so um as we all know clearly this video became quite poop centric so if you are triggered by that you can let me know in the comments but this was our first you know foray into non-traditional comment section content i won't promise that i won't ask you to tell me more embarrassing stories because i do find them hysterical but maybe next time you guys could pull some out that don't involve as much  just for the benefit of all of us even though they are funny just saying", "DqFtzuutIiA": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper i have another guest with me today i am so excited she is one of my favorites she is the darling of the daily wire gina chrono she is also the star of tara on the prairie which is our newly released film and i'm so excited that you're here thank you for coming the darling of the daily wire yes oh my gosh that's the sweetest thing ever um okay so tara on the prairie was just released how did all this process start so you got canceled severely canceled by disney yes yeah and so when were you picked up by jeremy and dallas um the day i got canceled okay um that was like one of the worst cancellations in hollywood i believe but um uh ben shapiro you know they everybody was like ben shapiro needs to get a hold of you and i was like okay so they i finally got on the phone with him and he was just like come to a movie with me you have to punch back and i was like okay because i was expecting to just stay in bed for a month and just be like okay and then just gradually figure out what i'm gonna do with my life um but yeah bench apparel kind of pulled me out i love it yeah i'm so sweet how did you i think that's how did you i was doing videos with prageru and i was doing social media on the side basically while i was in school and then was writing for a couple of economic journals and they apparently saw my social media and had this idea for a show um and so they slid into my dms which is the amazing stories the daily wires slid into my dms i remember the day i texted my mom i was like this isn't real and where are you were you in uh i have just left los angeles so i graduated from ucla i was living with my mom in boise for a time trying to figure out what i wanted to do because i left hollywood my cancellation i i was very intentional with you know coming out being not a liberal basically and so i was more prepared for it and it was gradual but it definitely has happened i mean yeah you know they canceled you yeah got dropped by my agents lost so many friends yes and so but it was more gradual it was nothing like your like fire storm of i mean the hate that you got was insane yeah but you know what like it's kind of my life i'm i'm used to it in a weird way everything i've done my whole that's why i i got so insecure to speak my entire life i was so insecure because every time i said anything it always got blown out of proportion um it was always a big deal so um yeah so i mean being canceled aggressively getting your ass beat on television um i've i just go out in very big ways but i guess which is so interesting because if you hear gina talk you're so sweet and you are very mild-mannered which i think it surprised me when i met you in person because i had heard you talk but just your entire demeanor is like like how could disney done this like you're literally like i feel like this is really nice that i know exactly it's but it always happens to the worst you know the best people in a way it's weird i feel like a nice person i go out of my way to make sure people feel comfortable and like i do that on set and i'm like how does this happen but um i'm okay with it though yeah so what attracted you to the terror on the prairie project the script because they signed you they knew they wanted to do a film with you it's a very you know violent it's very genre heavy what attracted you to the script well the story i've always wanted to be put in a dress and up on a horse because everybody's they're always like you know you're the action person you're doing this and i think that um tara on the prairie was you know the daily wire really wanted to do something different with me so i think it's one of my better performances as an actress i think it was just the right film to do we were planning on doing white knuckle and that didn't really pan out um because the sag-aftra might have imposed their mandates on us so we just did a non-union western instead and it's so amazing i love it how was being on septeror on the prairie different than something like haywire which is probably your most up until this point famous you know moment it was your star breaking into hollywood that kind of thing how is it different being on those two sets so those two sets i think uh haywire and uh tara on the prairie are my proudest independent movies so they're more similar than not yeah i'd say like there was not drama none of like the drama that you get in hollywood um no no big shots um you know besides tyler massive big shot just kidding the worst the absolute worst is the worst the comedy show was amazing last night oh i wanted to go yeah he was like rolling around on the floor yeah chaos he's talented i swear that's like seeing him in his like his element right there how was having him on set if i was directing it i would have just kept a camera on him the entire time you could have your own comedy special we just need an extra camera in here just put it on tyler and we will have so much footage for the rest of the movie so yeah if i was directing it it would be the tyler show i love it okay so we mentioned haywire briefly but if you have not seen gina and haywire there are a couple incredible fight scenes because you come from the world of mma you're a badass fighter my producer sheller who is over here that everybody knows and loves it's one of his favorite films he it's his favorite of yours and according to him this is the best fight scene oh in hollywood it's my favorite too by the way of everything i've ever done okay so going into this uh it's not actually a hotel room it's a stage okay and so the walls are actually not as strong as we'd would have liked them to be okay so when we start banging up against them you can kind of see them move because they almost fall down okay um i'm guessing everything is choreographed down to the t oh yeah and michael fassbender he's a legend you don't get a good fight scene without your partner being able to get and take shots so him selling everything i made this what it was so some of these walls are um foam okay so that you could like there okay okay and this is breakaway glass okay um this is funny because the the vase that we use the the stump people said you know don't look at it and he looked straight into it well keep going the first actor i ever acted with was this guy and he is a genius but he did all of this which was really really cool this is so cool how many takes did you have we did this for two days so non-stop two days banging each other all around this that's a fake wall i love the knees oh my god this was a lot of fun they let me just like kick them here [Laughter] that's what i was always taught in brazilian jiu jitsu especially as a woman like your knees are your most powerful assets yeah you're like and and that when we kick them through the door there they're like don't grab a hold of the door and he grabbed one of the toys yeah so this was my first my first film and i got to work with such professionals incredible and i helped choreograph this whole fight which is cool we had to make sure that line in the pantyhose was exactly where i was at every single time i'm sure yeah of the triangle chat yes i love when uh directors let this kind of live i was gonna say the fact that it's not so not dramaticized in a way but it's like it's not cutting away so much like a born film yeah letting it live yeah and then after i do that i get up and i sit on the bed and i like you know they kept on rolling and i'm like what else okay so just keep going find something else yeah i just like sat there like um yeah it's my one of my favorite things i've ever done is that fight scene very proud of it how did you i don't think i know the story how did you get into mma originally because it's very cool you get to merge these two passions of yours so what got you into it originally a thai man called me fat i know what i need that time i'm back in my life right about now yeah he was i used to go watch my boyfriend who i've known for 21 years we took a decade off so we weren't you know off and on but um yeah i would go watch him train and then i was you know we were partying drinking and um a little time in master chin about 5'4 it's like baby you need to lose weight and i was like yep okay i'm signing up with you my god oh no it's fine when people but it's still like i mean that created your entire career yeah yeah and when it doesn't come from a bad place when it comes from like hey i can help you here then it's like okay and um i i signed up with him lost 30 pounds and immediately started fighting and it became my addiction it like it replaced whatever everything else i was doing so it changed my entire life i love it well you can clearly see i mean watching your fights and then seeing you like you're so calm and serious and collected in all of this like it's so and the same with hair on the prairie when you're doing those fight scenes when you see you writing on the horse like you are so intensely focused yeah it's fantastic thank you everybody here okay so somebody said i would love to go on a date with gina carano even if it ended like this especially if it ended like this i get that a lot really yeah and i feel like people yeah i don't know i don't know if they would like that at all they want to be beat up at least you might be fighting people the entire day exactly well i talked a lot about my i did a live stream recently and people asked me about like my martial arts background so i was talking about the self-defense that i did because i did it for about eight years it was brazilian jiu-jitsu mixed with like taiwanese street fighting it was specifically designed for women against sexual assault all of the comments afterwards were a bunch of people being like oh i want to see brett fight that kind of thing i was like oh my god now it's the same comments as gina guess no no you dipped your toe inside i know my world somebody said gina carano could beat stephen crowder in a fight change my mind yeah no probably sorry stephen yeah i'm i feel capable um one of my favorites was when we were doing the taran the prairie um premiere and our uh girl who wants our tick tock was asking everybody how would you like how would you fare in a fight with gina yeah yeah and you were so calm and you answered and you were like no i could beat everybody it was so great it's strange like i think the older i get the funnier the question gets because i used to be like no no and i'm like yeah no probably yeah i mean not everyone not cowboy i wouldn't be a cowboy yeah there you go cowboy you're humble yeah i'm realistic i feel like i'm being realistic okay somebody else said believable female fight scenes begin and end with gina grano oh that's such a compliment thank you and someone said i have fallen in love with her at first sight recently oh very recently recently well that's a compliment my god um no but i mean truly if you need a morale boost ever all of the comments on all the fight scenes from haywire and if you go on to like videos of you they're not talking about the cancellation they don't talk about any of that it's literally like you are such a badass i appreciate that especially after everything you've been through oh thank you i'm i'm good i i feel i don't need to look at comments don't you can leave that to me it's a hot mess i'll just be like brett how's it going over here i'll text you updates yeah do not look at this do not look at this oh my god so you got into this industry 10 years ago how do you feel like it has changed since then so now you've been through the whole like you were you know a hollywood badass darling coming from mma now you're you know cancelled we're gonna how has it changed gosh i feel like people are are not making original content big companies and studios are telling us all who um we need to like and instead of letting stars emerge and i feel like i was an unexpected star from the mandalorian you know like people loved my character and they they weren't prepared for that they didn't know that like i was gonna be you know hitting home with so many people and because they didn't plan for it i don't think they liked it very much all of the people i look up to from the past or the rebels are the people that were like you know screw the system we're not going to do things the normal way and right now that seems to be everybody who isn't in hollywood i think it'll go through its waves though i think that eventually your door is going to be getting knocked on i think mine will eventually as well i think bullies in a way kind of like to be punched to the nose and so i think they're kind of watching us like gosh we can't wait to get brett that chance so i think it's coming it's just a matter of like um you know letting go letting go of the old and really accepting and embracing the actual new what's next for you do you have any plans i want to direct that's fun yeah are you actually are you going to move i know that you were thinking about montana after shooting yeah i'd love to i think i'll get the next job going first and then we'll see you know i think something pretty big is coming my way you know do you have that feeling where you that feeling yeah and i feel like everything that's happened and everything is just um it happened for a reason and i've got everything in my heart to make that reason worth something and so tara and the prairie was definitely an excellent start and um you know kind of starting another career and trying to get behind the camera i think is going to be like it's my dream so that's what i want to do yeah well yay all right guys gina caron is going to be directing something yeah it's very exciting yeah i adore you thank you so much for coming on i adore there we go that will be great we'll do more of these all right thank you so much thank you guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "95BpiYBkNx4": "foreign [Music] [Applause] people are saying that it's like some clone malfunction like her eye is dripping and just to pull it up but other people in the comments were saying no her eyelash is probably like glued stuck and she has to pull it no her eye was open prior to this she's having some like thing and you know what I'm not gonna go there I'm not gonna do it because that would be bad but I think you know what I'm thinking somebody said the side of her Temple is the reboot button yeah apparently I mean there are those theories that like all the elites and all the artists are basically just clones and we're replacing them slowly so maybe that's what it is I don't know I hope Katie's fine", "a0eIipnqJtI": "[Music] welcome back to off the clock i am stoked to be doing this video so i have always had a very all over the place bucket list and i'm pretty proud and grateful that i've checked a lot of things off already in my 20 years so when i was getting ready to do this video i realized that i needed to expand it a bit or go back and you know see what things i could check off just in general i'm somebody that is very goal oriented whether it's like a bucket list or you know my career and that kind of thing um and i like having milestones that i can hit i'm a big list person so i have everything written down so i can check it off so i feel like i am the walking embodiment the walking advertisement for a bucket list the things that are extra fun i've written in red everything's in red yeah i love it i thought this was really fun because i could get to know you guys see what my audience is interested in and chat about it because we probably have similar things we want to do the first one that i saw this girl says i just want to raise some goats my mom is babysitting five goats right now for one of her neighbors and she says that they are literally trying to kill her i always thought that i wanted goats and then i met some and realized how crazy they are and so instead we went the sheep route i actually love sheep they are so cute they are very very personable they have huge personalities so i think i would be more of a sheep person now i don't think i can ever go back to goats out of the way you oh what is that ever since i was a kid i loved top gun and for my bucket list i'd say fly the f14 tomcat so this year i've made my goal for this year i want to start getting my pilot's license obviously will not be able to probably achieve it this year in itself because it takes a lot of time to do all those hours which i don't really have my brother is a pilot and he went to the air force academy and was in the air force for a bit i actually think part of the reason why he wanted to be a pilot in the first place was because he loves top gun so much but he got his pilot's license when he was 15 i think in washington state the three things that he's like certified for that he really loves is skydiving having his pilot's license and scuba diving so i need to apparently do all of those things i have started my scuba certification though i need to finish that this summer so i'll add that to the list through hike the appalachian trail and yes people it is appalachian it is not appalachian when i moved to california and i would talk about being from appalachia like the town chattanooga where i'm from is in the appalachian mountains people go like oh why are you saying it like that it's appalachia like you've never even been there appalachia no say it like the locals actually say it is appalachian i did the approach trail and then like a few days worth of the part of the trail in georgia it was very very fun i've never through hiked anything though i did want to do when i was still in california i'd wanted to do the pacific crest trail i don't know if i'll ever get back to do that that would be very fun though that would be my uh reese witherspoon in wild moments make a loaf of bread with wheat that i grew myself i really have no desire to grow wheat but it's probably a good skill especially if the world's about to end but i do want to become better at baking bread i've tried to do a sourdough starter and i just don't have enough time to keep it up and bake with it all so that i just feel like i'm wasting it and then it dies but that would be very cool and you should do that peeing off the peak of mount everest that's very specific are you able to do that doesn't that hurt isn't it cold i have so many questions i feel like it would become an icicle just saying i don't feel like it would hurt i'm just saying i really don't have anything like like climbing a mountain on my list i do want to do the inca trail up to machu picchu i wanted to do that since i was in fifth grade because i did a geography report on machu picchu and i've been obsessed ever since and i said that when i graduated high school my mom and i were gonna go and then we never did it and then we just moved it to when i graduated college and then coveted was happening and then i immediately started working and now i'm in a job where i just can't really take a ton of time off so i don't know what i'm going to do it but i will at some point i will hike the inca trail to machu picchu it'll be wonderful hop around the greek islands and live like i'm the main character in mamma mia i feel like that's every girls fantasy we all dream about that a little bit i would love to go to greece i do want to go sail in bvi the british virgin islands though also because my mom did that with her first husband they would get their sailboat and go sail around and so i kind of want to go relive her younger life and do that so with sharks in cuba something with sharks would be fun i don't care if it's in cuba or not that just sounds cool actually i should add that to my list like a shark cage i would do that i've been to cuba i didn't swim with sharks though i swam with other fish in um the bay of pigs cuba's very fun highly recommend going if you can eat michelin star food that is very cool i've never done that ever when i think of michelin star y'all i can't help but think about gavin newsom in the middle of covid going to the french laundry with all of the california health experts all unmasked unvaccinated whatever while everybody else is locked down in their homes that's sad that that's what i think of when i think about michelin star he tainted it for me we have a skydiving rocky mountain climbing 2.7 seconds on a bowl named foo manchu love deeper speak sweeter give forgiveness i've been denying oh my god it's the song i was like man this really sounds familiar that's a fantastic song love like you're dying i like you sam potter you get it i want to own two potato farms oh my god the gem state idaho you're in the right state for it you are literally in the perfect place i sell my idaho license plates so i've got potatoes on my license plate since you are the gem state account i think that's very in reach for you do a backflip in a helicopter are you wanting to flip the helicopter upside down or you want to flip inside of it i feel like helicopters don't have a ton of room you do a backflip out of a helicopter skydive out of it i could be convinced to do that not inside though i want to get into a high-speed chase i would prefer to get away if not it would still be cool learn to swim those are like two very very different things i feel like there's a life skill maybe learn to swim that would be great just you know so you don't drown also high speed chase maybe you should do that to channel that better so that you don't get arrested let's take you to a nascar track you know i'm just trying to protect you out here i don't even drown i don't want you to get arrested not mine but my girlfriend has a bucket list item to pee in every ocean not sure how she's gonna pull off the arctic ocean but i support her you are a wonderful boyfriend it's really important to support your partner's dreams and ambitions no matter how crazy they are you just need to be there as a support system to lift them up to you know be a shoulder to cry on when they come home when it's too cold to pee in the arctic ocean true thing i've never peed in an ocean before it freaks me out physically i don't think i could stresses me out it just feels wrong but i love that for her support her base jumping i find it really cool to be able to jump off of high things without consequence what is base jumping think about batman i've never seen batman oh so just skydiving but not from a plane okay that oh base like a structure okay got it that would not want to do that i don't want buildings around me as i'm doing that you're still making fun of me because i haven't seen batman listen it's not my fault i was a sheltered homeschooler i want to wrestle a six-foot gator i don't but i love that for you you should go to florida go to the panhandle find a man that looks like he has lived in a lagoon for a while you need to find the florida alligator equivalent to tiger king and then you can do that my biggest most far-fetched is definitely going to mars someday the trip lower gravity discovering i'm just a very curious person are is this elon musk's burner account quite possibly so the plan here i just want to make this happen for everybody let's get you to texas get you to spacex elon's compound with his 500 000 children maybe because he has so many kids you pretend to be one of them get put into the will all of that stuff you get sent up to mars when he goes bing bang boom you inherit billions you go to mars i'm literally so smart i just need to solve everybody's problems number one to to never run over a landmine again so far so good well that's not what i was expecting but i'm glad you haven't done it again is that something i should be afraid of or worried about but it's weird that it happened twice right i want to meet everyone in daily wire that's actually very sweet you know the next time that we do a big event we always have like meet and greets and that kind of stuff so maybe you'll have to come you can have a chance to meet all of us okay this one is a list drive a tank that's cool go ziplining i do love ziplining go to a drive-in movie those are my most interesting ones i went to my first drive-in movie during covid because it was kind of i don't know la has all of these like movie in the park type things you can go in like the hollywood forever cemetery or there's this one that i loved it was called food truck cinema and you'd go out and you lay out on a lawn and there's food trucks and all that stuff but because of covid oh my god you were going to be too close to everybody so they just turned them all into drive-in movies which was super fun and i'd always wanted to do this before so i've never been to like an og retro one but that is actually very cool oh my god dining at the waffle house actually checked off last november 4th my anniversary did you go to waffle house for your anniversary listen i respect the game i love waffle house did you guys know the waffle house has one of the best emergency infrastructures in place like if the waffle house shuts down you know that is really hitting the fan when hurricane michael came through florida a couple of years ago it literally took the top off of my brother's house all the power lines were down he was like driving his huge diesel truck throughout florida trying to give people water and stuff because none of his friends cars could actually get out other than his monstrosity of a vehicle and waffle house was open and waffle house was like giving people their generators there's there's articles about it it's kind of like a cult thing look it up mine is building a car from the ground up i don't think i could do from the ground up that's very technical but i would like to have enough skills to rebuild once like refurbish a car my dream car is a international harvester scout and i want to do it myself so i can customize it but i think i'll need my brother's help i definitely will he figures things out and is the engineer and i will sit around and point and tell him what to do i'm trying to outlive the queen well she's looking a little frail i think you're doing fine i don't know how old you are but you'll probably be fine learn another language to the point of uh fluency that yeah i should add that to mine even though i can you know i shouldn't know i can speak english very well sometimes i trip up on words though don't give me that look i would probably learn it's not that i don't want to learn spanish it's so practical so i probably should but my i have my uncle is italian and they go to italy a lot so i think it'd be very fun to learn italian and then go with them but like when am i ever gonna use italian after that you know and spanish is fun from the three years that i have paid attention in college right a bull and not a fake one a real bull i have never done one of the mechanical bulls at bars and that kind of thing which feels like it would be on brand for me but i've never done it maybe is it too cliche i don't know i just haven't i should do that maybe i'll add that to the bucket list flying to iceland and becoming a fisherman for a week but not like small fishes big fishes you know you can go to iceland you can go whaling but only for the next year and a half i think is then they're outlawing it so you need to go before then you can get the biggest fish seeing biden's reaction when getting beat by trump in 2024 or desantis will he even have a reaction will he even be awake probably not he's going to be in a basement somewhere my bucket list go on a date with fred cooper i appreciate that i did see a bunch of them that were like can we meet you or whatever you know i'll meet you all at some point maybe what i just need to do talk to elon and clone myself she can go on dates i'm very very flattered but i just want you to know there are better things in life like the pyramids in egypt wouldn't you want to go see that like aim higher is all i'm saying like i'm fun and all but i feel like i would be a very boring date because i'd be like get me home by like nine because i want to see my dogs so my krusty white dog so maybe go to egypt is all i'm saying before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribe to this channel and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and i don't want you to miss a thing", "D1oE3sMbDl4": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I have never watched Scooby-Doo and yet I have talked about Scooby-Doo literally three times on this show in the last month because apparently the only thing Hollywood can create are new iterations of Scooby-Doo so we're back with yet another story but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection like I said it seems like nobody can get enough of Scooby-Doo like there is a new movie Velma is now a lesbian and now Velma is also an R-rated person of color in a new dark HBO Scooby-Doo series but there's a kicker dear HBO Max they just learned you intend to make a genre bending comedic origin story of Judy Jensen if there is one thing the internet agrees on it's that you should never change anything ever I hope you die sincerely Velma well at least Judy's still White all right I just I gotta leave okay we just started come on man listen listen there's a lot to see in this life not wasting it here hello solving solving stories yeah but I'm actually much more three-dimensional than that who is this a serial killer calling from inside my house yes that's a classic and that's my point why change anything when the classics all still work right wait you're inside my house [Music] my God that is so cringe they already know that people are gonna be upset that they're taking this spin on a very Classic Series so they're kind of you know trying to get ahead of it so they can turn around on us and go oh if you don't like it you're a racist you're a homophobe like no you just are not doing anything that's creative but we're going to talk about that later the point that I want to make now is you might have noticed that something is missing from this little Scooby-Doo landscape that would be Scooby-Doo because they cut Scooby-Doo from this iteration of the Scooby-Doo franchise are these people Daft in the head what is going on are they ill do they need some Montage products to get them back on their rocker boncharge is a fantastic Wellness brand that has a huge array of products to help you sleep better perform better have more energy reduce inflammation balance your hormones reduce eye strain you name it they have a product for you I personally wear their blue light glasses every day as I'm scrolling through the internet finding content for you guys and it helps me be a much more alert and less grouchy headachy person so I highly recommend them if you want to try out any of their products go to boncharge.com Cooper and use promo code Cooper at checkout for 20 off of your order again that is boncharge.com Cooper promo code Cooper at checkout and you guys should jump on this deal because their products might make some incredible Christmas presents for the deranged sjws in your lives like these creators because they are turning this into an R-rated apparently very self-aware cartoon and they felt that it was Scooby's presence that made Scooby-Doo a Kids franchise at the New York Comic Con a couple of weeks ago there was a panel for this Velma Scooby-Doo show with all the exacts of the creatives and this is what they said about the issue quote when we were going into the show and thinking about adapting it we wanted to be respectful we didn't just want to take these beloved characters and put them in outrageous or gross situations and say isn't it crazy that you did that to Velma well they considered finding ways to add Scooby-Doo to the show The Creative team just couldn't find a way to balance the two sensibilities we couldn't get a take on it that was like how do we do this in a fun modern way he said that felt like what made it a kids show was Scooby Randy also made it clear that even though Scooby-Doo won't show his face the new series still exists in the same universe as the iconic mystery solving canine but also what these Executives fail to mention is that the creators of the original Scooby-Doo the people who own it and Warner Brothers did not let them use Scooby-Doo in this series because the show was so inappropriate and they did not wanted to taint the public perception of the kids show so I guess that's positive but still they're letting them create this show and move forward with it even though it looks absolutely cringe and terrible I don't like it very much people online have opinions and I am loving it because they are not holding back at all I mean just look at these trailer stats this is from a few weeks ago when the trailer was first released it was posted by the YouTube dislike counter account wasn't it my mouthful Velma official teaser HBO Max views at the time it was 1.1 million there were 21 000 likes and 157 000 dislikes so now on October 26th the trailer has 2 million views but the likes have only increased ten thousand which makes me very very happy about this and I cannot wait to see how many dislikes there are thank you and best of all and I actually respect them for this they left the comments on and everyone is being so sarcastic and based it's amazing somebody said wow I love the part where we got forced representation in an already established franchise instead of something new and original that could have offered the same representation without deliberately trying to push everyone's buttons truly a classic mystery gang moment another person said I love feeling like I'm being lectured to and I watch a show another person said I love the part where Velma makes it clear that the writers hate us another person said I loved the part where Scooby-Doo self-identified as a cat groundbreaking heroism and last but not least one of my favorites and here I thought HBO never makes a bad show literally nobody is enjoying this scroll through the comments there's so many of them in that I love this format and they're all being so sarcastic and pointing out the blatant arrogant and condescending nature of the show and how it's written I also saw this meme on Twitter and it cracked me out because it was super relevant already existing popular franchise and talentless people justifying changes with made for modern audiences yeah again create something new please I'm begging of you because I would love to be entertained then I'm really not right now there is also an awesome Tick Tock that now has 2.1 million views describing the situation and I just really like her take because it has Common Sense which is rare these days apparently so not only are they not including Scooby-Doo in the cartoon Scooby-Doo but also they have race swapped not one but two of the characters nobody has a problem with there being black characters it's a problem when you take original characters and you completely change them it's the sentiment that this is happening to so many shows that are coming out and just because it's not happening to one that you like oh you just wait your turn I am waiting on Netflix to take Inuyasha and do a live-action version completely neuter it just like how every other show is being done nowadays if Mindy wanted to create her own animation of black characters nobody would have cared why do we feel that it is appropriate to take a children's show and politicize it how is that appropriate this is supposed to be entertainment for children you are taking the focus away from the show and bringing the focus into race and politicizing a children's show I don't know why but somehow a children's show has to be political and it has to Virtue signal too and they have to make it rated R s creepy I don't know how many times we have to say it leave the kids alone let the kids have their shows stop taking it and neutering everything and politicizing everything it is beyond frustrating don't be surprised when the entertainment industry just ends up being a money laundering business at this point because who's watching this I'm not literally nobody is this was my first time seeing this girl but I now follow her she also has a YouTube channel her name is Brittany venti she has so much common sense I went through some of her other videos she's just great she made exceptional points and it's nothing that I have not said it's nothing that you guys don't know it's just a new voice for you guys to follow but the comments were so based it says 2.1 million views it has almost 21 000 comments and they're all like this that ain't Shaggy that's Shaquille they are lazy so what I notice is they take already established shows in movies with a fan base they switch the name and characters and they were falling for it somebody else said exactly if they want a POC character they need to make their own a new one that they can market and grow again there's nothing wrong with that that would actually be more beneficial it's kind of offensive that they're like oh we're not really going to give you a new show we're just gonna shove you into another one and hope you're happy like that's not actually growth and tolerance and increasing representation that's like throwing minorities a bone you can't think that's good somebody else said and after they change it they attack people as racist or sexist for not wanting to watch it that's literally what we say all the time on the show another person said you get it the problem is they can't come up with original ideas anymore and then when it fails they have something to blame other than themselves I have loved doing this segment today because all of the comments are so positive I don't know whether these people are Democrats or conservatives but I do know that they are fed up with the pandering they are fed up with a lack of creativity and Hollywood and the elites pretending like we're idiots and we're not catching on and that should give us all hope so I'll leave you with that hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "8NOjoK57m1w": "hey Brett hey hey what are you up to carving a pumpkin do you mind if we come around back sure why not do you guys just let yourself in yeah I hope you don't mind yeah it's fine so have you carved one of these before I

favorite thing actually no is that your least favorite thing about living in Nashville no I'd say Broadway is oh that's fair do you think it's worth going once though I think so especially if you're a tourist fair so what's your favorite thing about Nashville the proximity to Eastern Tennessee oh yeah is that where you grew up Yes actually I was raised in Chattanooga wow so how many states have you lived in I think five now whoa which one was your favorite I love living in Washington state because we lived on an island oh okay if you could go anywhere in the world where would it be uh I probably want to move to northern Idaho oh why there because it looks like Washington and the Pacific Northwest but it's conservative oh sounds perfect now what about traveling if you go any in the anywhere in the world where would you go Machu Picchu oh why Machu Picchu because I did a geography report on it in fifth grade and I've been obsessed ever since was that when you were homeschooled yes oh so what

diet a raw diet do you make that yourself oh uh I used to and it was such a hassle but now I get a meat delivery service yeah that sounds pretty gross have you ever tried any of it oh no I never okay so I know you like cooking do you cook often I do do you find it intimidating to start cooking for yourself now that you're out in Nashville I did which is really ridiculous because my mom was a cooking teacher for literally years and even so it like freaks me out and I didn't think I was very good at it at first yeah that's a hard act to follow now what's your favorite meal to cook uh right

daily wire um not having to censor myself at the office preach did you ever imagine yourself as a YouTuber though never but did you come up with a concept for the comment section uh no it was actually pitch to me what's your favorite thing about it now that you're doing it getting to do something different every day and tell a different story every day I love that who would be your ultimate guest on the show Kanye obviously oh that would be an interesting one where do you want to see this show go um to the moon so does that mean you like crypto oh God no I literally know nothing about it what's something else you know nothing about um any movies or cartoons in the last 25 years that's probably a good thing to be honest right is there something you know about a lot about that people would be surprised by sailing oh that's so Random why my entire family sales my dad was a competitive sailor my mom used to sail and all my brothers and I competed wow do you think you could still be competitive depending on the boat probably dang that's impressive is that your favorite mode of travel I love being on the water but flying is more convenient true what is the furthest you've ever

you have not already subscribed to this Channel and ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "kv8oVnFWDdA": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper first of all just wanted to say thank you for every comment and dm and message and if you are you know close to me every text i think you might know my social media posts but i had to put down my childhood dog the dog that i've had for 15 years literally have never lived without him i'd put him down late sunday night so i took yesterday off um got a bunch of stuff taken care of which was very necessary so thank you for watching the off the clock videos while i was gone over the weekend and for all of the kind messages it really made it a lot easier it's very weird to be now living you know within this kind of community that we've built and sometimes it feels like you know you have all of these eyes on you but the kind of inverse of that is that you also have this incredible support so thank you so much for that you all truly mean the world to me we're hitting a million this week most likely it's insane so just thank you for being here and thank you for being so kind but i want to get into it because there is obviously some huge news that happened yesterday that literally everybody is talking about regardless of what side of the political aisle you are on and so i'm gonna dive in i think you all know the fbi raided mar-a-lago fbi donald trump put out a statement last night and he said these are dark times for our nation as my beautiful home mar-a-lago in palm beach florida is currently under siege raided and occupied by a large group of fbi agents nothing like this has ever happened to a president of the united states before after working and cooperating with the relevant government agencies this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate it is prosecutorial misconduct to the weaponization of the justice system in an attack by the radical left democrats who desperately don't want me to run for president in 2024 especially based on recent polls and who will likewise do anything to stop republicans and conservatives in the upcoming midterm elections such an assault could only take place in a broken third world country sadly america has now become one of those countries they even broke into my safe what is the difference between this and watergate where operatives broke into the democrat national committee here in reverse democrats broke into the home of the 45th president of the united states now in his statement trump did not disclose what the fbi is looking for if they have even told him he is clearly sticking with the story and the assumption that this is all you know just part of their fear propaganda trying to turn the country against him turn him into a villain which is what they do best here's johnny but of course the mainstream media has a different take nbc news uh tweeted update the fbi search of former president trump's home in florida is tied to classified material that trump allegedly took with him from the white house to his mar-a-lago club that belonged to the national archives a source familiar with the raid tells nbc news so we're raiding a president because he took some papers from the national archive breaking into his safe and his home the entire thing just feels fishy but i mean we are living in 2022 guys it is the year of gross government overreach if they can do this to the president they can do this to you they are going after your personal property they are trying to get your financial assets you need to make sure that you are financially stable and the best way to do that is by investing in precious metals with bully and max bullion max is a direct to consumer precious metals retailer that can help you diversify your financial portfolio into gold and silver which will help secure you and your family in times of crisis like right now i mean have we seen the inflation rate i love bullying max because you can order online without ever having to talk to a salesperson which is literally the worst and then your medals are shipped directly to your home the shipping is fully insured and taken care of if you would like to get started go to bullyingmax.com cooper to get their silver starter kit at employee pricing this is a special deal just for you guys it is bullionmax.com cooper you don't want to miss out on this opportunity because it feels like this is the time to start burying gold in your backyard be like we all need to be a little bit more ron swanson right now that's all i'm saying i've heavily invested in gold which i've buried in several different locations around pawnee or have i obviously this is a very serious situation and i feel like every political commentator is going to be talking about you know the deep ramifications of this our democracy is eroded everything is corrupted all of that i just want to take a moment to breathe because one i have not had the best 24 hours and you know the world is chaos so i pulled some memes because i'm just here to try to help you all find some humor sometimes so this one was my personal favorite imagine the fbi's surprise when they opened the door and saw this and it's trump with all of his mcdonald's imagine if he had actually gotten a tip like he would do that and be like oh you're here let me just feed you and then like ship you on your way i love the man like even if you think he's crazy like he's an icon siraj was on a roll last night posting all these memes which by the way siraj is in the hospital right now with some kind of stomach thing so everybody you know send a prayer to siraj he was still like posting and posting memes about the raid which is fantastic he said trump forgets to return blockbuster rental and the fbi is banging down his door that's basically what is happening my friend sabrina tweeted and said you know what i'm gonna vote for him even harder which is kind of the result of all of this i feel like the left believed that if they you know tried to take down trump again if they sent the fbi in that everybody on the right would turn against him and go oh yep well they tried to impeach him twice now he's being raided by the fbi i guess we have to walk away no the response is everybody going okay i think he just won the 2024 you know primaries [Music] like you just handed him the election because now all of us are so committed to this man fighting against your corruption that's like okay well i've got to support him now i don't even want him to run you are handing him this on a silver platter maybe this is their whole corrupt plan trump seems undeterred and he released this video on truth social last night and it's kind of epic so let's just watch we are a failing nation the rain this is like so epic we are a nation that is begging venezuela and saudi arabia for oil we are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed where crime is rampant like never before where the economy has been collapsing where more people died of covet in 2021 than in 2020 and we are a nation that is hostile to liberty and freedom and faith we are a nation whose economy is floundering whose stores are not stocked whose deliveries are not coming and whose educational system is ranked at the bottom of every list we are a nation that in many ways has become a joke but soon we will have greatness again it was hard-working patriots like you who built this country and it is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save our country as long as we are confident and united the tyrants we're fighting do not stand even a little chance because we are americans and americans kneel to god and god alone and it is time to start talking about greatness for our country again [Music] damn it i would vote for him i will absolutely vote for him that's like 100 percent a campaign video they literally left it as the best is yet to come president donald j trump he's running he's so running the man is a legend maybe he's gonna save america again i really have no idea but he released this last night as the raid was going on which you know spidey senses like was this already produced was he just waiting for a good moment to release it or did he send his editors out quickly to get this video i just the timing is kind of perfect and he is utilizing this incredible marketing opportunity also as the raid was going on there was so much support outside of mar-a-lago people came from alabama in florida they were all driving in to palm beach to support him look at this video like all of these cars of his supporters are outside of his home supporting him people saying that you know magga and trump support is dead it's could not be farther from the truth the left tries to paint this narrative that trump is a broken man like he can only speak to us via you know truth social and his press releases that his base is completely destroyed and i feel like they thought that with this fbi raid they could kind of blow that up once and for all but every time you attack trump and he you know rises from the ashes like a phoenix and comes back stronger and is here defending the american people it just makes the base stronger and it makes people that are kind of on the outskirts who were maybe never trumpers who never wanted to vote for him in the first place but now is like 110 in it makes those people stronger because he is the only person that is standing up against all of this the takes on twitter were just all over the place it was kind of surprising i was expecting that there were going to be a lot more you know tweets about people being excited about this raid happy about it but those voices were completely drowned out by people from the center to the right saying this is absolutely unconstitutional this has never been seen before the fbi is like completely off their rocker which is so fantastic that people have that take because that really is what we should be focusing on morgan from babylon b said while the fbi raids mar-a-lago i'd like to take this time to remind everybody that not one pedophile connected to jeffrey epstein has been imprisoned again if they were actually seeking truth i don't really think they would be going after some papers in the national archive there are a lot more people they could be writing right now will chamberlain tweeted and said democrats are behaving as though republicans won't take power ever again and matt walsh had an interesting take which i actually agree with and he said well they're behaving as though republicans won't do anything with their power once they have it and they are probably right which is kind of the sad state of the gop right now where a lot of people you know talk a big game but when push comes to shove they are very you know malleable they will bend they will take the knee it's kind of a a black pill take there but it's not totally wrong somebody else said destroying 30k classified emails with a hammer and bleach doesn't get your home searched remember that again that's sort of in line with what morgan was saying the hypocrisy is just blatant my good friend amir odom who i encourage you all to follow uh he's the one that i did the shocking truth episode with he did a great post on this last night uh just about the hypocrisy of all of this because hillary has never gotten raided hunter biden who is on camera doing illegal acts with a laptop that is exposing his family's corruption he's ever gotten raided but james o'keefe did james o'keefe has been rated like three times at this rate alex jones was just ordered to pay 49.3 million dollars over the things that he said about sandy hook but what about biden and fauci and all of those health officials that lied about kovid that inflated coveted numbers will they ever have to pay for the things that they said will they ever be raided by the fbi will they ever be brought to trial no because they are supported and backed by law enforcement by the media by the establishment they are protected if they actually cared about truth and law and order and all of that crap there is so much corruption on that side of the political aisle that they could be going after i mean obviously the gop is not exempt from all of that but my god there is so much blatant corruption that they could be exposing oh nope don't see anything totally blind to that so it's not about truth it's about control and it is about power and so now i want to leave you with this quote from trump he has said similar things many times but every time i hear him say this it's just even more powerful and even more true never forget everything this corrupt establishment is doing to me is all about preserving their power and control over the american people they're coming after me because i'm standing up for you and they're coming after you believe me they're coming up for you there's another iteration of what he said many years ago where he said they're coming after you but i'm just standing in the way which still in 2022 he's not even president anymore that is still the truth people like him ron desantis rand paul thomas massey those are the men that are actually standing up to defend freedom to protect american citizens and everything that they do to try to rip them apart is what they would ideally like to do to american citizens who have the gall to question the establishment so just keep that in mind guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "LpAeLHuuL6o": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper you know I mentioned last week that I hadn't had a good protest episode like I feel like that's a weekly thing that I need to do just to keep myself entertained just to acknowledge that you know the people around me are crazy but at least I'm still sane it just gives me a good perspective but on Friday I opened up Twitter and I saw this post protesters Don cement shoes to protest vegan milk charges at Starbucks these people won't stop and it absolutely will not stop ever I don't know like peta's entire thing right now is the vegan milk at Starbucks you know there are plenty of other grievances that we could be talking about when it comes to animal rights but instead no they want vegan milk that is 50 Cents cheaper do you have any more almond milk so these are the same people that were gluing their hands of the Starbucks counter and apparently that wasn't good enough so now they are donning cement shoes I don't really know but the thing that really irked me about this entire situation is that this protest was in Nashville and I missed it it was on Thursday morning I didn't see it until Friday it was happening after my show is over so I could have gone and looked at these crazy people face to face and I missed it you missed it and like it made me genuinely sad because I would have loved to see this in action but you know what's done is done I'll get them next time but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and if you haven't checked out my merch yet you can do that at dailywire.com Brett I hope you like the first capsule as much as I love making it I appreciate all the support on that so anyway as you see in these pictures they literally put their feet in cement box now I was doing some research about cement and skin and apparently if you're if you have like a limb that gets put into cement like you get all these blisters it's like you get burned and these people were able to get their feet out of them relatively quickly because you see this picture of this guy getting put in handcuffs without the cement on his feet so maybe it was like some DIY artist cement I don't know if you guys know in the comments let me know because somehow they got out of it it honestly seems like the super glue on the countertops would hurt more than fake cement on your feet but I don't really know I also appreciate this lady's cow pants it's like ma'am you apparently hate cows and drinking real milk so much why are you wearing cow's pants I don't really know but somebody commented and said if you take their signs from them they can't exactly chase after you to get them back that's true uh somebody else said is there a Pier nearby why no particular reason just curious also is there a wheelbarrow around I honestly I'm kind of bummed that they got their feet out so quickly I would have loved to see the police officers come with like a dolly cram it under there pull them back and push them did you guys ever do that like my brothers would put me on the dolly and like push me around I would have loved to see that happen another person said as much as I don't like Starbucks as a company the reason why vegan milks cost more is because Dairy is highly subsidized by the government this isn't an issue that can be handled by the market somebody says I don't think Peta cares no Peta does not care about any kind of rationality they just want to scream about random that is going to get them clicks on the internet they're not actually doing anything productive and this person is absolutely right I mean first of all the government is already so involved in food production and then they are even more involved in agriculture so everything from your milk to your beef has been touched by the government which is why I love good ranchers so much because when you buy your subscription your price gets locked in so you can rest easy knowing that the price of your monthly meat subscription box will never change and on top of all of that good ranchers has incredible values that we can all support this month they are on a mission to donate 100 meals to kids in need in this back to school season and to help them out I am putting together a bit of a giveaway where if you buy a box of good ranchers meat using my promo code you will be entered into the chance to hang out with me on September 29th for a zoom call we can hang out cook steak answer questions it'll be a great time but in order to be entered you need to go to goodranchers.com use promo code Cooper and with that promo code you will be entered into the giveaway you will get 30 off of your order and you will get free shipping it's just wins all around guys and you're sticking it to the pita freaks so like what's not to love so there was a news article about the protest and this is where I learned that it was in Nashville uh it said protesters against Starbucks vegan milk prices shuts down West End uh here it is Nashville Tennessee a group of protesters took a stance outside the Starbucks on West End about vegan milk I was literally at the Starbucks like three days ago like I missed it I'm never gonna get over that the street was shut down Thursday morning and businesses had to close their doors including Starbucks the reason why they had to shut it all down is because these protesters did not just go into the Starbucks or stand outside of the Starbucks door no they cemented their feet in the driveway that leads to Starbucks and that whole shopping center which is why they had you know the caution tape around them and all of that crap I'd see the protests led to three people being cited and one man physically arrested following the protest one guy said man this was entertainment he apparently had a front row seat at the protest he said man they were fast within seconds they stopped the whole Starbucks they just shut it down no one could come in no one could come out over a dozen metro police cars shut down the streets as protesters cemented their feet to make the point a Peta representative said Starbucks claims they care about sustainability yet it still charges customers up to 90 cents extra for non-dairy milks and she says the coffee Empire's extra charge on vegan milk hurts the planet and by Starbucks's report their use of dairy is their largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions I love this part somebody else said as with any protest there was opposition that came from across the street where a guy named Gavin held a sign saying soy milk sucks you're tripping an estrogen like an absolute soy boy uh listen there's nothing better than regular milk at the end of the day people are going to drink milk people are going to eat milk there's nothing they can do about it this whole thing is ridiculous I mean first of all I've said this before like when they were gluing their hands at the countertops these protesters they should be going to the Starbucks headquarters like why are you not in Seattle the regular workers at your local Starbucks they cannot do anything instead you are inconveniencing them you are inconveniencing regular people that are just trying to get into the hair salon next door to get their hair cut these people can't do anything in this country you obviously have a right to protest but this whole thing just seems illogical if I was Starbucks I would personally just start charging more for vegan milk because you're pissing me off and you're making my workers deal with your I'm just saying it they've been doing it for months and there's been no progress maybe they should actually go to Seattle and try a bit harder here's the video that Peta posted because if you thought that you were gonna get out of this without watching the video of it you're not also cracks me up that they proudly post this it's like the people that glued their hands to that painting in I think it was France and they were so they were proudly posting it hoping that everybody was going to cheer them on and everybody was going like you're such an idiot like this happens on every Pita post and it kind of makes me happy oh foreign do these people have jobs do they get paid by PETA so there's four one two there's four of them that cemented it and then they have little workers that are putting the caution tape around them on a Thursday morning do you have a job do you have anything better to do where you can be contributing to a productive happy Society instead of keeping people from getting their six dollar latte from Starbucks if people want to get it they should be allowed to like what if someone just wanted to go in a mattress firm to buy a mattress they couldn't because you're just being annoying this is another angle from somebody who was driving by here they are [Applause] so their chant is Save the Planet save the cows and the vegan up charge now like do these people realize that you don't have to kill a cow to milk it have you ever been to a farm like I'm sorry my mom's Jersey cows seem pretty happy and they produce a ton of milk every single day now obviously there are those huge like Mass Farms where the you know the cows are all crammed in there those are gross and I don't think that the cows they're healthy and that is something to be talked about like I don't know Peta maybe you could spend your precious time educating people about that encouraging them to look for grass-fed options like good ranchers where the cows are happier the meat and the milk is healthier for you it's good for everybody but instead you're cementing your feet outside of a Starbucks because you don't want to pay an extra dollar for your stupid soy milk it's just like why please the replies were super based under the Peta video like I said some person said what are you in here for I didn't like how my soy milk costed 50 Cent more than cow milk so I put my feet in cement yeah like I would really love to see that guy in his little rolled up beanie and his cuffed pants in The Slammer you love it here ah I'm having the time of my life nothing against that I'm just picking on them because I don't like him another person said this is like the least important issue you could be working on and this demo is one of the reasons why people don't take you seriously and I say that as a long time vegan it's like I have no problem with people shining a light on animal abuse I have no problem with people talking about veganism if that's something that you want to do but this is ridiculous and it is hurting your cause when people make fun of that lifestyle and of you know the pita people this is why you are doing it to yourself I would respect you so much more if you picked other issues and you were actually serious about education but this makes me not care at all another person said I love meat it's the best food group like that's what your protest makes me think as well looks like meets back on the menu boys and I'm not even trying to shove my carnivore lifestyle down your throat another person said what if they went to another coffee shop smiley face like literally if you have a problem with a business you can take your money elsewhere there are so many other coffee shops and breakfast places that do not up charge for vegan milk I think like Einstein Bros a couple of other coffee shops that I read they don't Upchurch go there if Starbucks wants to up charge if it makes more financial sense for them to do that that's fine the world does not need to bend to your every need these people gluing themselves to countertops and cementing your feet to things you're just trying to make yourself feel important but listen the sooner that you realize that you are in the driver's seat that you are in control of your emotions and your reaction to the world around you you will be happier and it will feel even better than you thinking that you're some important virtuous person like I guarantee it just take your money elsewhere it's literally that simple and get a job that would also be fantastic for society guys we are adding new comment section content every single

guys there is something in the water in the UK I don't know what is going on but they are having like protest season you know you have you know Festival season all of that stuff awards show season it's protest season in the UK and I'm so happy about it because it's actually giving me incredible content I was expecting to have fantastic pro-abortion uh protest content because at the beginning of the summer after Rovio Wade was overturned all the pro-abortion people said oh it's going to be the summer of Rage we're gonna have so many protests they really haven't done much but the UK man they are keeping it going so we're gonna talk about that but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell so that

shipped out so if you have received it tag me in a picture let me see so I can repost it I'm so excited for you guys to get all of that back to some idiotic people I was talking to Schuller and I said that I really have to do one of these ridiculous protest episodes every once in a while because they just make me happy and I always just want to remember the people that we're up against and the guys we are so much smarter than them like we really are it kind of makes me happy because look at this this is a bunch of teenagers dumping milk on the floor for some reason because they are anti-big milk industry they want all of us to be drinking cashew titty milk instead of regular raw milk I don't know but New York Post launched the story earlier this weekend and said teens are dumping milk on store floors to protest the destructive dairy industry somebody commented and said not a single one of these kids has set foot on a dairy farm in its shows uh but here let's watch this first video there's a couple of them this is in Manchester oh there we go that's nice it just sounds like somebody's peeing you're not doing anything look at these kids just trying to buy a pumpkin and it's like oh honey there's there's sad people pouring milk out they're not saying anything what are they doing let me just dump another pint of milk Court what is that a quart say something if you're destructing property if you're stealing things and dumping it on the floor at least tell me why we just have this like silent girl over in the corner a literal mute that has the like destructive Dairy sign somebody said protest the dairy industry by making stores buy more Dairy brilliant yeah I don't think they thought of that somebody else said awesome I'm sure the kids working minimum wage there can't wait to clean that yeah that is my biggest problem with like the Starbucks gluing their hands on the counter or this kind of protest like you're not actually moving the needle with the people who actually produce the dairy or the people who buy Dairy for stores you're just making life miserable for the people that just want to get out of there 6 a.m to 2 p.m shift on time as somebody who worked in a grocery store for five years I'm telling you I would have like [\u00a0__\u00a0] slapped these people because they're making my life living hell it makes me not even want to go out in the world which is why I love that car Zing makes the hardest and most cumbersome parts of car shopping all online so that you don't have to deal with any of these types of people protesters or car

crying over spilled milk that's a good dad joke no it isn't another person said this is amazing way to get the members of the working class behind your cause at a time where people can barely afford milk exactly it just seems incredibly insensitive but that's not all there's another video because apparently this is not a singular event this is now a thing people are doing it's like the UK version of Americans glowing their hands on Starbucks counter for PETA here we go [Music] this girl at least is talking but we have another mute just holding a sign awkwardly like dude say something he now looks embarrassed like oh my God I can't believe I've done this I don't know these people look at him like I'm also just fascinated with the UK grocery stores like is this a refrigerator right here it's totally out in the open wow so angsty so angsty also why are these grocery store workers not just getting their asses out that girl looks insufferable these people have they're just there's no respect oh now let's make a bigger mess let's step it out there these sweet little old men are being so nice could you please leave could you please leave no kick their asses out they have no respect whatsoever somebody said makes me infinitely less likely to switch to a non-dairy diet somebody else said anti-egregious food waste overall less interesting than throwing stupid Van Gogh yes speaking of Van Gogh if you thought that I was going to avoid talking about that I'm absolutely not because that is the other ridiculous environmental protest that happened in the UK this weekend I'm sure you all have seen the picture but a couple of young girls following in line with the other people that have glued themselves to other paintings sprayed things on them all of that they threw tomato soup at Van Gogh's painting of sunflowers oh my God there we go that's the most British thing ever they pulled a glue out of their boobs now they're dripping and gluing themselves to the wall okay that's just part of it now let's hear what they have to say because then they start talking to people as the security is walking up that was so bad oh my God what is worth more art or life is it worth more than food worth more than Justice are you more concerned about the protection of a painting or the protection of our planet and people cost of living crisis is part of the cost of oil crisis is unaffordable to millions of cold hungry families they can't even afford to heat a tin of soup wow that was certainly profound that first line though what is worth more art or this planet whatever she said that did seem kind of Shakespearean it might just be because she's British and she is you know kneeling and saying it but I did feel like we were about to launch into a Shakespearean monologue my mind completely changed on that when she started talking about the environmental crisis and how throwing soup on paintings is gonna fix all of that somebody said ironic considering they are all for preservation literally yeah other person said I'm struggling to understand why destroying a painting of sunflowers done by Van Gogh an impoverished man who was marginalized in his local community due to his mental illness is the right target to make a statement about how awful the oil industry is yes like all of these protests they are all about attention they're not actually reaching the people who are making the decisions in the dairy industry in the oil industry in the fossil fuels industry whatever it is you're just harming other people's work and getting in the way of other people's lives if you want to protest that's fine if you're passionate about something that's great it is your right to do that but maybe do it effectively so that you're not getting in the way of normal people's lives and you're actually moving the needle and making change that might feel better to you like I'm not really in support of your cause but this makes me like despise your cause and that's probably not the impact that you're wanting this person said what did Van Gogh do though like couldn't we have thrown stupid literally anything that was symbolic of Big Oil honestly embarrassing and that is apparently coming from somebody who does not like big oil the girl talked after the fact she went to court this is the same girl with a pink hair and this is her talking about why they did this type of protest and what it meant and how the painting was not actually damaged I've not seen this clip circulating very much so I'm excited for you guys to see it it is interesting so here we go I would like to make one thing perfectly clear we did no damage to the painting whatsoever I was in court yesterday heard that there's been minimal damage done to the frame which is repairable and replaceable and absolutely no damage did some damage it was behind the glasses never ever would have considered doing it if we didn't know that it was behind glass and that we wouldn't do any damage I mean literally we were sat there still glued to the wall they wiped it off with a bit of kitchen roll I recognize that it looks like a slightly ridiculous action I agree it is ridiculous but we're not asking the question should everybody be throwing soup on paintings what we're doing is getting the conversation going so we can ask the questions that matter questions like is it okay that Liz trust is licensing over a hundred new fossil fuel licenses is it okay that fossil fuels are subsidized 30 times more than Renewables when offshore wind is currently nine times cheaper than fossil fuels is it okay that it is there an action that has led us for the cost of living crisis where this winter people are going to be forced to choose between Heating and eating this is the conversation we need to be having now because we don't have time to waste last year sir David King said what we do in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity oh my God so we're doing these with the Al Gore we're all going to be extinctive to get need your attention because we need to get people talking about this now and we know that civil resistance Works history has shown us that it works okay well civil resistance in history did that in include throwing soup at paintings no this is just ridiculous and you know she seems well spoken she seems eloquent but none of that was conveyed in the video where she was destructing a piece of art if you want to get the conversation started maybe do something that will spark that conversation not spark worldwide outrage and mockery of you yeah you're getting attention but for literally all of the wrong reasons and I appreciate that she is admitting that they were just trying to you know get the media to look at them and get people talking online but like girl it really is not working we're not talking about Oil we're not talking about the environment we're talking about you and it's not a good look it's interesting though because these girls were not the only ones throwing orange goop this person apparently did not learn from their mistakes I think they're part of the same organization but this person sprayed orange stuff on an Aston Martin showroom also in the UK trying to make some sort of statement here we go [Applause] I would love it if that was actually soup but it's not it's some sort of paint oil-based even though they're anti-oil [Music] we will not be stopped by injunctions that are intended to silence protest we're a non-violent Civil Disobedience Movement we know that the changes in the laws the injunctions against us are irrelevant in comparison with my starvation with the genocidal policies that our government is pushing for with their 100 new fossil fuel licenses in the North Sea I can think of other things that are more genocidal than that my friend I will say though maybe it's just because these people are British everything that they say carries more weight to me but I think it's literally just their accent but then I have to bring myself out of that go no Brett this is still just absolutely ridiculous snap out of it like again I have the same sentiment this is utterly ridiculous and it is getting in the way of normal people trying to go about their day and go about their business imagine that you're just a nice normal person trying to go in and look at a car and suddenly you're being sprayed with orange goop by Ave them receiving hairline man in a dress now this guy had another video where he was kind of doing more of an explanation we'll watch that every single day our government continues commissioning new fossil fuel licenses rather than insulating the homes of the UK rather than investing in public transport for everybody right I mean you see behind you this is the exact opposite of the kind of public transport that this country needs right very very private very very expensive cars for the very very few Aston Martin is not systemic change public transportation dude and we need it as soon as we can get it because we've been told by the former Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK government sir David King that what we do in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity those aren't like words also I just have to point out in that original video you can see I'm wearing a dress there he is he's in a skirt this man is in a skirt and like some kind of female crop top with a receding hairline like this is so classic I hate the fact that I could guess what this person was going to look like he probably also is like some queer activist and is very proud that he's intersectional and environmentalism and all of that crap I don't even know all the leftist buzzwords somebody said because it's not public transport it's a card on a bloody Mega Bus and somebody said he she it needs a damn good soaking and used engine oil somebody else said his negativity is receding his airline somebody else said hmm he likes the color orange he may be seeing a lot of it soon oh God but the story does not end there this is the last Act of this segment uh somebody posted this and said conspiracy brain telling me that the souping of the van Gogh was an OP to make environmental activists look ridiculous I thought that was interesting because this end Big Oil movement in the UK all of their protests are utterly ridiculous and they continue doing these stupid things like gluing themselves to paintings throwing soups spraying these car manufacturers whatever none of it is working I don't know anything about the organization I don't know anything about the fossil fuel production in the UK all I know are that these people are kind of moronic and so I thought oh that actually could hold up and then I did some research and I quickly found that this just stop oil Civil Disobedience non-violent movement is actually funded by an organization called climate emergency fund which was founded by a Getty oil heiress that's right one of the richest people in America like from the Getty family seeping in Big Oil money so you know what maybe that is true maybe this will all just work in our favor but you know part of me wishes that this wasn't the case you know I really want these people to actually care and I wish that we could have a discussion about you know free market Solutions and things that would actually help the planet that are not you know throwing soup on you know pieces of Art and thinking that windmills are going to save us all because it's not a political statement to say that you love being outside and you love breathing fresh air and loving the Earth it shouldn't be that political but these people they make me hate environmentalism they make me hate the planet and the climate crisis and make me want to be as far removed as possible so create a new strategy that's all I'm asking hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "Ven7A-Hlfok": "[Music] [Music] at the intersection of conch and coral [Music] that's where i am he's right on top of me but i can't see him what's he doing he's just standing there

an appearance at the conference he took pictures with fans he mingled for a bit and then he left he was only there for a few minutes but the harm that he caused was truly truly earth-shattering and so this is the comment that podcast movement put out hi folks we owe you an apology before sessions kick off for the day yesterday afternoon ben shapiro briefly visited pm 22 expo area near the daily wire booth though he was not registered or expected we take full responsibility for the harm done by his presence there's no way around it we agreed to sell the daily wire a first time booth based on the company's large presence in podcasting the weight of that decision is now painfully clear shapiro is a co-founder a drop-in however unlikely should have been considered a possibility many in our community are appalled not just by this but by our choice to take money from the daily wire in the first place as a random person said this was signed off by a human yes during event planning the dangerous nature of the company's messaging was overlooked those of you who called this unacceptable are right in nine wonderful years growing and celebrating this medium podcast movement has made mistakes the pain caused by this one will always stick with us we promise that sponsors will be more carefully considered moving forward and just to clarify no daily wire representatives were scheduled to appear on panels and shapiro remained in the common space and did not have a badge if you have questions we're here to talk thank you for reading and we hope you'll continue to join us from here on out [Applause] literally what kind of beta cucked monologue is that what kind of lefty non-binary they them social media coordinator wrote that and thought it was okay to post the dangerous nature of the daily wire we should have expected that it was a possibility that the host of this podcast would show up at a podcast conference at a convention where other talent is on panels and taking pictures with people at this time of year at this time of day in this part of the country localized entirely within your kitchen yes mash it oh my god the audacity literally how can you be intimidated by ben shapiro he is the most sweet man he is not intimidating in the slightest that just goes to show how sensitive these people are i'm just gonna roll some clips from ben taking pictures with fans does this look harmful or dangerous to you no everybody seems happy ben is so sweet he's taking pictures with everybody oh there he is he's walking out he's leaving no harm done the best part about all of this is that almost immediately the reply started rolling in and people started calling podcast movement on their [\u00a0__\u00a0] now podcast movement has about 64 000 followers i saw these tweets about 20 minutes after they had been posted and i did not see one supportive or validating comment in that time frame all of the replies were based they were no supportive or validating or like oh thank you for like protecting us no everybody even people on the left were going this is ridiculous you are not a political or partisan organization we are just here to celebrate this medium get your heads out of your asses like somebody said so you're saying you'll take ben shapiro's money but will publicly condemn his presence clown count clown uh somebody else said he's five feet tall i think y'all be okay he's five nine thank you very much put some respect on his name somebody said i hear there were people so overcome with emotion over his presence that they were fainting and a couple of them got seriously hurt head trauma from a fall do you care to confirm or deny these rumors uh and somebody replied to that and said i thought snowflakes floated to the ground who knew another person said let me translate it is scary when articulate smart people come to our events we're not used to that damn seriously how does he harm anyone at the conference even if you dislike him which i tend to this is not the way to go i love when people are willing to admit that they have political differences but are willing to bridge a divide for the sake of common sense and just human decency and the fact that that is something that i have come to not even expect anymore is kind of sad so this is a pleasant surprise somebody else said i always wondered what those college lads who required a safe space went on to become now we know yeah it's the social media coordinator at podcast movement probably their entire organization somebody else said my dog was neutered sounds like this happened to you two well if my assumption that this was written by a non-binary they them that might actually be very spot-on literally the thread was like a mile long it was insane podcast movement and benchmark started trending on twitter and then podcast movement privated their account which is literally the most beta cuck thing that you can do i say this a lot but if you are going to be on the internet if you're going to say something controversial if you are going to make a statement if you start getting pushback deal with it you made the decision to post it don't run away from your problems that's all i'm saying so here you go you can see these tweets are protected because they don't want any of us harmful people finding them now we have seen the tweets we have read the replies from the attendees we've seen people happily meeting him so excited that ben shapiro was there at the daily wire booth so who was complaining who on earth what is this mass swarm of people that was so harmed by his presence this person tal who goes by evay them what a shocker in the business we call this foreshadowing hey at podcast movement what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] as a trans person as a queer person as someone with a uterus this does not make me feel welcome this does not make me feel safe just confirm with the podmov team that they did not know shapira was attending in fact they were told he was not him showing up was the first that they knew about it does that make everything okay no am i much happier knowing that he was not an invited guest absolutely hashtag pm22 restricting replies because i don't have time to moderate them clown in the quote retweets would make it original please and then and then they privated their account they thought that their little account with 3 000 followers they thought they could make a little splash do some virtue signaling get a little bit of attention they did not expect that basically the entire internet was going to say you are literally a sensitive idiot go home you are being ridiculous and everybody knows that this is an account with 3 000 followers who posted one picture and started this entire firestorm it is like the harry's razors versus daily wire all over again i don't know if you guys remember that but harry's razors there was a random tweet from an account with literally two followers that tweeted at harry's and said i can't believe you worked with daily wire so then they pulled out and publicly slandered us which is why we created jeremy's racers to get back at them and like the daily wire harry's razors feud this has also grown to astronomical levels ben started trending and it has literally reached all corners of the internet i checked this morning he is still at the top of the trending page here it is it says ben shapiro the podcast movement issues an apology for hosting a booth for the daily wire at their ongoing conference in dallas and for the harm done by host ben shapiro's unexpected appearance this is not the worst description i have seen on their trending page like it's pretty mild and it's not really slandering ben it's giving a good description of the event so i'm not too mad about it uh but people started just tweeting outside of that thread comfortably smug tweeted out and said congratulations to ben shapiro thanks to podcast movement for the first time in history someone was threatened by your presence a landmark day for 4 11 men everywhere and ben wrote back and said no one's chucking this elf buddy uh lydia from tim cass said so rude you're just as tall as tim is matt's idea shop who works here with us said benjamin walked past my desk and said hi it was violence i was murdered by his presence call the police another guy said ben shapiro exists podcast people help help i'm being oppressed no help i'm being repressed yeah ben is oppressive to you because the truth hurts and also he's better at podcasting than you are which is probably fault of your own so just be better somebody else said i don't usually ask for prayer requests but my cousin was at podcast expo and ran into ben shapiro and he experienced harm the doctors say this might be it god every time he walks by me i feel like i'm about to have a heart attack somebody said imagine being completely broken by ben shapiro's mere presence what a world literally then everyone's favorite troll alexstein99 actually went to the podcast movement which is still going on it goes all week uh to do some on the ground reporting and some investigative journalism if you will about how people actually felt about ben being here they let ben shapiro you know vince shapiro is uh no no why'd they let him in here though you know they shouldn't let him in here i have no opinion oh my god do you mind apologizing for letting them in i'm sorry i don't even know what you're talking about do you mind apologizing to me for letting vin shapiro appear here you know he's harmful this is a podcast movement i feel very victimized that you let him come here will you apologize to me apologize see on twitter they apologize but she won't apologize but isn't he super harmful because he's conservative literally that woman i think knew what was going on because she was desperately trying to look busy with all those papers but nobody else cares that first guy was like who the other people were like oh yeah i don't really care it's literally the social media coordinator just taking a step back and getting a broader overview of this entire situation this is a fantastic very tangible example of what i'm always saying about how there is a radical one percent that is basically controlling everything that everyone is so afraid of like this account three thousand followers posted one tweet one picture and made all of this happen because people were so freaked out that they were gonna run around and cause like a social media hoopla well guess what you were a pansy you bent a knee you bowed to that radical one person and you created an even bigger firestorm and now the daily wire is pissed to you and when you try to touch the lowercase god king jeremy boring and his employees he does things like create a revenge razor company so i would tread lightly podcast movement that's all i'm saying you made your bed now you need to lie in it hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "1YMJjwfEFPY": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I feel like I've talked about this a bunch over the last couple of weeks but they just keep bringing it up we're talking about abortion again the midterms are right around the corner and people have decided that abortion is the most pressing issue but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a comment section or off the clock episode and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection first of all Anne Hathaway who I love so this really sucks she went on The View yesterday we just have to watch this clip get ready to cringe and also just be angry at her this is not a moral conversation about abortion right this is a practical conversation about women's rights and by the way human rights because women's rights are human rights and the freedom that we all Hillary Clinton talking point to choose and build our lives and have access to excellent Health Care we got all the seals imagine saying one other thing abortion can be another word for mercy we don't know when you allow for choice you allow for flexibility which is what we need in order to be human so that anyway I just wanted to increase it it can be it really can be yeah right so dramatic is flexibility I just thank you for the Applause like give me a break I really don't mind the view when they have somebody on there that they hate because they bring the drama they're fighting at each other but when they're sitting around kissing each other's asses just makes me want to puke kind of makes me want to die inside and this is really no different abortion is flexibility abortion is Mercy no you're saying that you want to take an innocent life so that you can have flexibility like lady you had the freedom and the flexibility not to have sex in the first place or to use contraception and Mercy Mercy from pregnancy that is a terrible way to frame bringing a life into the world oh I need Mercy from that sorry what and I hate this because as I said like two minutes ago I love Anne Hathaway I think that she usually stays Above The Fray she's an incredible actress she seems like she has brain cells somewhere in there not really sure now but she's always been classy I feel like she's never you know gotten into the nitty-gritty celebrity stuff and so I hate this stop talking about abortion stop talking about anything you clearly just need to go home and work on your health actually you might benefit from some balance of nature products because living a healthy lifestyle is not easy it's hard to get up and go for a run every morning it's hard to make sure you're getting proper nourishment especially when you're like buying and you're eating chalky chalky chip ice cream every single day balance of nature fruits and veggies are the best way to make sure you are getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day now you might think you're hitting the recommended servings of fruits and vegetables every day but most of us aren't honestly and that's where balance of nature comes in their products are 100 whole food and they use a cold vacuum process that preserves the natural phytonutrients and whole fruits and vegetables and encapsulates them for easy daily consumption prior to starting this sponsorship balance of nature sent a bunch of their products for me to try and I am so stoked to be adding them to my daily supplement routine I feel like I'm upping my game and I've been taking Reds and greens for a while now but this is just so much more convenient and

ever like our Skin's going to be glowing we're gonna have so much energy that's one of the things about doing the show that I don't love is prior to doing the comment section I would know that there were a lot of celebrities I disagreed with and I would still be able to you know watch their shows listen to their music whatever now I'm in the thick of it and I see everything that they say every day and I realize that I really just dislike all of them and it's very disheartening but you know what it's okay I find all of it for you so you don't have to I'm really taking one for the team the comments were a major white pill somebody said she is just laying the groundwork for another Oscar yeah again she is taking off all the Talking Points she needs to be in everybody's good graces somebody else said she has rehearsed her lines yes again it was very fake is it just me or does nobody in America use contraception if you do not want a pregnancy is pretty simple quote if it's not on it's not in it is so easy to get contraception in 2022 it is so easy to learn about your ovulation cycle I'm not telling everybody when I do these episodes that you need to be some abstinent sexless creature forever just be responsible take accountability you could literally get a condom anywhere go to CVS go to a truck stop you can get one it is very very simple at this point in time there are virtually unlimited preventative measures that you can take and yet they still choose abortion as their form of birth control this is not some rare legal and safe it's just for crisis situations no they are just doing this willy-nilly and they are morally okay with it they are morally rationalizing it which is abhorrent to me but that is not the only abortion conversation that is happening in Hollywood right now watch this scene from the new season of Love is Blind and I apologize in advance for the titles on this I had to pull it from a tick tock and this woman was trying to explain her thoughts about the scene as it was going on also trying to convince people that she was not pro-life the whole thing but just listen to what the person on the show is saying [Music] yeah there's so many complications medical and also learning complications and I see the amount of trauma that it does for me if I knew that I could try again and hope that the second time is better than I would go that route what the person who made this Tick Tock is saying is that she is pro-choice but she is concerned that this is being aired in front of disabled eyes and they are hearing that their life does not matter which is a very very valid concern but I want to get into the nitty-gritty of what this person is saying because this is heartbreaking the woman who was on this show who was one of the contestants who has now like found her future husband this is them now having conversations prior to getting married she is a child speech pathologist she works with children with Down Syndrome every single day and apparently she does not believe that their life matters this conversation came up on the show because she has gotten engaged to this man who is pro-life they didn't discuss this prior to getting engaged they are just now figuring it out and the most shocking thing to me was how many people came on board like this article like how love is blind Nancy talks about abortion should be a road map for everyone season three Texan expertly walked her anti-abortion fiancee through why she believes in the right to choose and apparently that's because she doesn't believe that disabled lives matter same with many of the comments on Tick Tock somebody said I think that it is an important conversation it's okay to be honest we can't punish people for knowing their limits this woman said my brother has Down syndrome and it is hard I see what my parents go through my fiance and I have had these what-if conversations now I definitely agree that these are important conversations to have with a potential spouse potential partner because if I heard that I would know that our values were very misaligned and I would get the hell out of that relationship but the more important Point here is how these people think and rationalize their pro-abortion stance they would rather try again and hope for something better than raise the child that they have just conceived and the comments like this just absolutely broke my heart this person said as somebody who has worked with medically fragile children this felt like putting them in a box like they're a burden another person said I am a Peds PT working with children with disabilities and in 2021 I had my son who was born with a surprise Down syndrome diagnosis he brings so much love and joy somebody else said medically fragile children are a gift to families experience heartache loss pain frustration absolutely but they also have much love perspective reward and so much joy I mean these comments were everywhere and they were trying to be so positive and trying to shine a light that their child is not a burden and obviously if you watch my show you guys know I have a brother that has a disability I would not give him up for anything and being in that situation and seeing these comments of people saying that oh these people's lives don't matter it's less about abortion as a singular issue and more indicative about our culture as a whole we are so selfish and irresponsible and morally corrupt and it's not just people on reality TV shows it is our politicians the people that are running to represent us in federal government like Raphael Warnock in Georgia just watch his ad this is recent this is his closing ad before the midterms I'm Rafael Warnock and I approve this message my husband and a child we received a call from our doctor he said our daughter had a rare genetic condition even if she survived the pregnancy she would not live for more than a few days the only way we could help her is to make sure that she went back to God in peace Herschel Walker thinks that he should have that power to make that decision not a mom like me he wants to ban all abortions even in cases of rape or incest even when a mother's life is at risk Herschel Walker thinks that as Apollo petition he knows better than a mother that's not just wrong it's cruel after watching that ad I can really only say again it is the culture his mother is saying that it is so cruel that people wanted to keep her from getting an abortion but like lady isn't it also cruel to abort your child and I was thinking about this and obviously you know Edward's syndrome it's different than Down syndrome Down Syndrome has a longer life projection but you would rather abort your child than try to give it a Fighting Chance especially in a time when still so many of these in utero diagnoses can be wrong like that mother who said they didn't know that her child had Down syndrome until it was born so many of these cases they give a diagnosis you don't know until they're out of the womb until you're dealing with it you really just have no idea and then the other weird thing is that she left her anecdote and wrapped it back around to Herschel Walker talking about the cases of incest and rape like lady are we talking about your quote medically necessary abortions or are we talking about the cases of incest and rape abortions following incestry make up such a small percentage of abortion literally 1 that data is everywhere so in order to talk about that one percent you first have to say that the other 99 is immoral and that we have to agree on that otherwise you're using that one percent as an argumentative scapegoat and that's not right somebody commented under the video and said it sounds like she's thinking I don't have a perfect baby so I would rather not be inconvenienced with taking care of it somebody else said I think if Democrats could have their way we would have a society based on Eugenics and not on the love of children no matter how perfect or imperfect they are literally yes you do not have to have more than three brain cells to research that and understand it and imagine being somebody who was born with a birth defect or who has a disability whether it be physical or alerting disability and watching either of those videos it's just disgusting these people claim to be loving intolerant but obviously they value their lack of personal responsibility their quote flexibility in their convenience way more it's just an utter lie thank you for watching the comment section if you want to

going about your day-to-day life at least somewhere in the back of your mind if not the Forefront of your mind you're thinking about the companies that you're supporting their values where their products are made whether they are aligned with you at all because that's kind of the world we live in now where everywhere you turn it seems like corporations hate you or they're pushing some agenda that you do not like well I'm sorry to say that we have another one because a Virgin Atlantic Airlines has a message for all of us but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a comment section episode so let's just jump right into this video you might have seen it already and if you have not I apologize in advance here we go [Music] foreign [Music] you might be thinking oh my God Brett Virgin Atlantic is hiring very weird modern dancers to be their flight crew but no they're not they are just changing up their uniform to make it more gender inclusive I don't know if you saw the writing on that video where they're saying your uniform your identity anything you want which is very odd to me because I'm thinking about you know flight attendants all of that it's very rare that I actually see like a female flight attendants wearing dresses these days I see a lot of them just in pants like already the uniform seems pretty unisex in general but Virgin Atlantic really wants to take it a step further they are obviously hungry for those Progressive brownie points under that video they replied and said are Vivian Westwood uniforms were designed in 2014 and have been proudly worn by our crew pilots and ground teams ever since this update allows our people to choose which of these uniforms best represent against them no matter their gender identity gender or gender expression and then in addition to these new uniforms I really don't understand what they are still I think it's just skirts and pants like normal but I guess their new policy is that it does not matter if you are biologically male or female you can wear whatever the hell you want in addition to that they are also going to have pronoun pins and they're making this whole gender initiative and here is a part two where they have some guests come into the video [Music] I wanted to be involved in this campaign to affect change in this world I have a trans non-binary child so for me changing the world is my job as a mom and as a friend and an ally I feel that drag queen and ferocious when I am ready to take flight be yourself campaign means absolutely everything to me I get to be myself a non-binary person I have the choice for uniform which is a massively big thing it's so important my pronouns are prefer any pronouns she heard they them I feel great I look like I feel very slow put on I said yeah it just feels very much like me like a fool very affirmed in this time yes I just pull out myself I love it [Music] if we are clean and we are pressed and we are looking the way we're supposed to look then why aren't we able to present as we identify and that's what's so beautiful about Virgin Atlanta see the world differently first of all I hope they're not wearing those red high heels if you identify as the female uniform because I think I actually have that exact pair of red high heels and they are not comfortable so yeah apparently drag queens youth social workers lgbtq TV personalities and activists are your new flight crew and virgin Atlantics the influencers in a way I really don't know but this doesn't really make me feel safe I'm not saying that a man in a dress inherently makes me feel unsafe it's just when I'm thinking about the people that are supposed to be protecting me on a flight I really don't want to be concerned with what you're wearing and your pronouns at that moment I just want to make sure that my life vest works and my pretzels are delivered securely to my table like imagine if this you know spread out over all these industries imagine if you were at some ranch and you saw a man in a dress trying to like tackle a cow that would never happen on a good Rancher's Ranch because it's simply impractical unlike so many other companies these days good ranchers focuses exclusively on having the best service and delivering you the best possible product rather than pushing an ideology all of their beef is either upper choice or USDA prime their chicken is hormone free with no added antibiotics and their fish is caught fresh and then flash frozen so that when it is delivered to your door you are getting the best possible quality you really cannot get this anywhere else if you want to try them out go to

company that obviously cares more about a political agenda rather than their clientele I was just sitting there this morning thinking like what could have compelled them to do this like did they think that this was going to go over well do they think everybody was going to be so excited so anyway I decided to do some research well they've had no media attention recently except this because like many other airlines the they have been struggling here is a Bloomberg article from literally just a month ago and it says Virgin Atlantic Narrows loss sees return to profit next year because just last month their financials were publicized and in 2021 they had a loss of 638 million dollars and they don't expect to see profits return until 2023. I do not think this is going to help putting drag queens and men in dresses on your planes really is not the greatest money-making scheme like have you been watching Hollywood at all everything that they are doing is woke and Progressive and politically fueled and it is tanking and nobody is happy like this is not the way to go about it if you want to make more money I think in general maybe you should be able to fly more places because in my research I also saw the Virgin Atlantic flies to 35 Plus destinations that's really not a lot so maybe you should focus on getting some more Roots getting your planes and your men in dresses stewardesses to more airports and then maybe you will make some more money just saying but in general online people seem to be in agreement that this is just ridiculous even people who are going like I don't care want to find attendant wears but this is just kind of stupid like just nobody's happy like this person said Virgin Atlantic recruitment drive going well oh God yep I don't want to see what their uh front desk people are wearing somebody else said bring a whole new meeting to transatlantic flights laughs somebody else said I'm not pro or anti-drag but who thought that this would be good for business they should be fired immediately like this is not unifying this is not bringing more people to your airline it's making me go um okay well in the one percent chance that I would have to fly a Virgin Atlantic I'm going to choose something else another person said I only see he and she options where's Zay gender is a spectrum you need like 4 000 more uniform options duh yeah that's because it's ridiculous they are using basically the same uniforms and just saying okay a dude can wear a skirt if he wants like literally every airline has unisex options like gone are the days that you see stewardesses in like tight little dresses and super high heels everybody's wearing pants and practical shoes unless of course you're flying like Emirates or Qatar airlines where the women are still like this big and in tiny pencil skirts with little like handkerchiefs wrapped around their necks like that's the only place you see this so Virgin Atlantic you're not really being revolutionary with your new outfits you're just kind of making people angry drag queens it's really that simple another person said I would bet that the majority of Virgin Atlantic staff would rather have a pay raise in this especially with record inflation yeah I'm sure they would customers care about safety flight's on time low prices and certainly not what uniform attendant has on or what it says on their name badge literally yes I would as a customer and I do not care the gender identity of any of your crew members more money would probably be better and just make everybody across the board a lot happier like it truly is just ridiculous from a business standpoint like they know that they're struggling they're wanting some attention they're wanting people to jump on them and see how Progressive they are so they pulled this woke stunt is it actually genuine probably not but already their clientele is not happy and we all know what is going to happen next they won't take any responsibility for the backlash they will just blame it on their customers for not being woke enough which is exactly what Hollywood does every time one of their stupid Progressive movies flops so I guarantee that is what will happen mark my words hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "3tCfIyg1NDA": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper and in case you've forgotten elon musk bought twitter it was funny i saw a comment on one of my videos from a couple of weeks ago about elon it popped up on my instagram and somebody said not everything is about race and politics he's just a billionaire who wants to acquire things he didn't buy it for political reasons i was like have you even read any of his statements or seen anything that he tweeted about how he bought this for the purpose of free speech protecting free speech at the moment modern public square anyway that was funny to me but elon musk still in the news but before we get into it make sure that you like this video and subscribe to the comment section channel if you are not already and ring that little bell so that you never miss a single video yesterday tuesday he was interviewed for the financial times's future of the car conference that they were doing and the man interviewing elon brought up donald trump's lifetime ban on twitter and asked whether elon would ever reverse that i guess the answer is that i i i would reverse the perma-ban i'll say i'm not i don't own twitter yet so this is not like a thing that will definitely happen because what if i don't own twitter but my opinion and jack dorsey i wanna be clear shares this opinion uh is that we should not have permafrom events honestly this clip is not that revolutionary or surprising in my mind um it makes sense that he would reverse trump's ban i mean elon is basically the poster child for anti-cancer culture you know who else is against cancer culture nimi skin care they are the only conservative skin care brand their anti-woke their anti-cancer culture they actually donate some of their profits to conservative organizations and you should try them out i personally use their daily glow up set it has this cleanser it has a moisturizer and then it has a toner literally all it has changed my skin so if you would like to order some click the url that is in the description use code cooper for 15 off of your order and as i've said before if i do one thing with a sponsorship it is encourage a young man out there to try a moisturizer or to try a cleanser i promise girls will love your clean skin girls will also love you if you have billions of dollars like elon musk and are able to buy the modern public square to protect our free speech that's hot so what i immediately noticed is that people both on the left and the right but especially on the right were narrowly focused on trump coming back saying this is the greatest thing in the world he's coming back mean tweets this is going to be amazing trump has explicitly said that he does not want to come back to twitter he is on truth social he is truthing you know whatever he does i'm not actually on truth social so i don't really know he's staying there well i'm not i'm not moving what the most important takeaway is that on a whole if this deal goes through with elon buying twitter which i'm guessing that it will there will be no lifetime bans he believes that it's immoral and then people on the left were at the same time freaking out thinking that donald trump was coming back this was a video that somebody posted it's like a meme elon musk adding trump back to twitter that's a pretty accurate representation of the internet yesterday after all this happened i mean just listen to these guys this person says world's richest man says he'll let insurrectionists use twitter to format violent anti-democratic coups so i guess elon is okay with what trump did when he was on twitter using the platform to spread 30 000 lies in incite and insurrection which people died just a reminder that elon musk regularly converses with cernovich on twitter elon doesn't want these people banned because he is these people if you are not one of us you are one of them how dare elon not fall in line with every single one of your left-wing ideas we've said it before elon's not a conservative why are you guys so angry did someone need a hug there's nothing left-wing about elon musk he just uses leftist bros to buy his overpriced cars elon is as libertarian right as libertarian right can be weed and white supremacy that's it i mean i do think that he is a libertarian but weed and white supremacy last one by reinstating trump elon musk is condoning lies and disinformation he's clearly comfortable with someone inciting violence to overthrow our government the march towards autocracy continues you are really dumb for real i swear these people listen that clip that i showed you that was like a 20-second clip like i said that was circulating both the left and the right were going wild that was just a small portion of a much broader conversation that was had a much longer question um and elon was actually going in and replying to people who were posting that clip saying please watch my full answer because it's not just about trump he had other ideas so to please the king himself we are going to watch this full answer and i think it's really good there's a general question of should was twitter have permanent bands um and you know i've talked with jack dorsey about this and uh he and i are of the same mind which is that uh permanent fans should be uh extremely rare and really reserved for uh people where they're trying to uh before for accounts that are uh bots or spam scam accounts uh where there's just no legitimacy to the account at all um i do think that uh uh it was not correct to ban donald trump i think that was that was a mistake um because it uh it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in donald trump not having a voice he is not going to be on truth social um as will uh a large part of the sort of the the right in the in the united states um and so i think this could end up being frankly worse than having a you know single forum where everyone can debate um so i guess the answer is that i i i would reverse the permaban i'll say i'm not i don't own twitter yet so this is not like a thing that will definitely happen because what if i don't own twitter but my opinion and jack dorsey i want to be clear shares this opinion which is actually shocking i don't know because jack dorsey has been such a beta freaking weirdo for so many years and now that he's outside of twitter we're seeing like these like tiny instances of him being semi-based like now that he's outside of the big tech like world i don't know if it's because it's better for him now to be based or if he actually can be but he's showing like like small signs of common sense so this is all interesting no no that doesn't mean that somebody gets to say whatever they want to say if they say something that is illegal or um otherwise uh just you know just destructive to the world then then that there should be perhaps a time out a temporary suspension or that particular tweet should be made invisible or or have very limited traction i will say it is interesting hearing elon who is a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist talk about how he intends to rework the app with these like no perma bans but maybe a suspension and you know banning bots but not you know certified accounts that kind of thing i'll just be interested to see that if this deal goes through if he ends up buying it if he becomes the ceo or whatever however he intends to be involved whether these safeguards actually become about safety rather than political bias because what we've seen for the past couple of years is that twitter isn't really protecting anybody they're just protecting their political side i think pro-events just fundamentally undermine trust in twitter as a a town square where um everyone can uh voice their opinion it was a fun i i think it was a morally bad decision to be clear and and foolish in the extreme even even after he egged on the crowd who went to the u.s capital some of them carrying nooses you still think it was a mistake to remove him what i think the if if there are tweets that are wrong they should and bad those should be uh either deleted or made invisible um and a suspension a temporary suspension is appropriate but not a permanent ban so if the deal completes he might potentially come back on but with the understanding that if he does something similar again he'll be back in the sim bin uh he has publicly stated that he will not be coming back to twitter and that he will only be on truth social and this is the point that i'm trying to make which is perhaps not getting across is that there is that banning trump from twitter didn't end trump's voice it will amplify it among the right and this is why it is morally wrong and flat out stupid the point that he made at the end of this video i think is arguably the most important part of this almost four minute video he's saying that banning people from you know the modern public square social media sites trying to silence people it doesn't actually suppress their voices it just moves them to a different area it limits political discourse and it puts us all into echo chambers and creates massive political division it's awful for our country regardless of what side of the political aisle you are on that is why elon is saying that it is morally wrong and flat-out stupid i mean it would be the same if some left-wing politician was banned and then we couldn't see what they were doing in order to live in a society where we were able to vote and be engaged citizens we have to know what both sides are doing and banning people kicking them off of platforms it's never going to be effective and it's only going to harm our country i do agree with elon on this this is a broader very complex topic that begs nuance it's not just about trump getting back on it's not just about babylon b not having their account suspended anymore it is about protecting free speech on both sides of the political aisle and honestly that's why i think elon is kind of the perfect person to be buying twitter and doing this because you can't fit him into a political box like we use him as one of our champions because he's championing some of our values but really he's not a conservative uh and he's not left-wing he sits directly in the middle i think he has a lot of common sense which sadly not so common these days and i think he's the right person for the job so we'll see what he does keep your eyes and ears open and i will keep you updated guys we

haunted house slash movie it's like my worst fears all combined I already don't like horror films I already don't really do well in haunted houses put them together when I'm sitting in a room basically just by myself I can't see anybody else here I'm exhausted and I don't want to go to bed tonight is what I'm trying to say if you guys like this game if you're like sheller I think you might be a little sick in the head because like my art is racing I thought I was gonna give myself a heart attack we'll be back probably playing more of this maybe not because I don't know how much of this I can stomach but thank you all for watching and please tell my producers how terrible they are in the comments for making me do this Brett out forever before you go make sure that you like this video

pride month you really can't ignore it if you don't know that it's pride month what rock are you living under because they make it very known literally every aspect of our culture is infiltrated by pride at this point in time i mean the amount of weirdness and virtue signaling that we see is off the charts and we already talked about the military advertisements we talked about the gay bottom friendly menu from postmates but now it is time to merge pride with environmentalism but before we get into it you guys know the drill make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and ring that notification bell we are almost at 600 000 subscribers working towards a million this year the rate that we're growing is just absolutely insane could not be more grateful so let's keep it going super stoked but anyway have you guys heard about the audubon society it is a environmental nonprofit that is all about birds and they have a big twitter presence that is usually very cringe but they protect birds preserve their habitats all that jazz which is fantastic like i love that for birds but as you know birds and i don't really have the greatest relationship i'm semi-terrified of them especially larger birds that have more of a running capacity and to give some context i feel like this is you know a childhood trauma response because we had a flock of ducks uh on the island where i was born we live we lived on a farm and my mom had a bunch of ducks and they would just be like running around and so i feel like one of them must have chased me at some point and then i have like this deep rooted traumatic memory uh also living in california i would have seagulls come and attack me grab burritos out of my hand i've had a weird run in with a swan like it's just think me and birds just don't really work i hate birds they're so useless therefore this video that i'm about to show you is literally my worst nightmare i might actually die which is why i am so grateful that i have epic will if i die while watching this horrific bird video with you all i can rest assured that my assets are secure that my legacy is preserved and that i am not leaving anything up to the state epic will is the easiest way to secure your future and you can go to epicwill.com and use code cooper which will give you 10 off of a complete will package guys it

epicwill.com use promo code cooper they will get you guys set up they are a fantastic sponsor go check them out and do it before you watch this next part of the video so go now and when you come back we're gonna get into some birds may i present to you the drag queen climate change bird dance [Music] birds tell us birds tell us that the world is changing you know that the climate is changing they sing it over us and around us in their songs and in the songs they no longer sing do you know why birds sing just before dawn people believe it's to tell each other that they made it through the night as a way of saying i'm still here still here maybe that's why we sing too as a way of saying i made it i'm still here [Music] will we choose to listen [Music] birds tell us there is something worth singing this boy's making more noise and a couple of skeletons throwing a fit on a tin roof reminding us something so profound be a quiet sound i just really want to know what somebody like john muir would say about this john muir is the one who basically discovered yosemite a very very famous american environmentalist absolutely incredible but but we're we're seeing a drag queen spin in a field with the birds chirping you know what this it made me feel like i was watching like a thesis student film like overly dramatic and emotional not really a lot going on but shot you know semi well but the like will we choose to listen to what the birds must say insert like spinning shot he's like moving tell me i'm wrong like a student film a very very dramatic angsty like i understand the world oh there's so much that pangs in my heart that's 100 what it was now if you watch my videos regularly and you recognize that drag queen i really don't know if it's possible to recognize the drag queen that is because he is the one who also did the very weird pride north face ad where he was like in a tent gallivanting through the woods i feel like any drag queen you see in the woods is going to be this guy because it's apparently a very niche market uh his name is patty gonia like two words like patagonia but patty gonia and he has this whole instagram where he you know flits around in the woods and now basically his entire life is just doing brand deals because everybody wants the niche environmental drag queen because there's only one of them and so all of the outdoorsy brands are like oh my god we need to be at cutting edge we need to be pride so everybody's using patagonia he's probably doing financially very well props to you you have found a very lucrative career for yourself because apparently just caring about the outdoors is not enough we also must be gay we must be gay and environmentally conscious that is the future of progressivism anyway this whole video just got destroyed online there were a lot of people that were you know defending it and saying like oh my god this is bringing such like fantastic awareness about birds all of that there are a lot of people that are said common sense but like this person whose handle is trans rights are human rights peace sign all that said if you came to the comments to criticize ask yourself why nature includes so many different kinds of birds but humanity excludes so many different kinds of people they're bashing it because i don't like gay people i don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin frogs gay somebody writes back so your claim is that trans people are in fact a different species oh that was good this person says people have been costuming and dancing to celebrate birds for almost as long as there have been people homophobia is the only reason to single out patagonia's performance for ridicule and then this person puts a bunch of screenshots of dancing birds this one in the corner is horrific they are literally like this is extreme weird furry you've watched way too much planet earth way too much national geographic and you're wanting to walk around as a bird like that is the kind of stuff that haunts me that is the stuff that makes me need epic will because like if that chased me i would probably have a heart attack and die just because people have been weirdly dancing around as birds does not mean that we need to normalize that with drag queens does not mean that i want to open up my phone and see drag queen bird ads like at this point i'll just go live in the freaking woods like take me off the grid this person says victoria's secret did it better less drama less makeup they're not wrong they are not wrong this person says you paid for the entire campaign so i guess you have to follow it through it's just so ridiculous you should have talked to some lesbians judging from my bird watching club they are out there doing environmental work all year long only the men can be celebrated in pride month you know it is true though when you look at the pride advertisements all the stuff that you know is shown these days it feels like it's just drag queens but really it's always been about the gay guys what about all the other members of the alphabet mafia i mean i guess lesbians are too busy you know dancing to indigo girls and being at their bird watching clubs to be part of all the pride stuff just listening to the space stuck quack quack what a majestic creature the gay guys are really what drives it home but honestly i do give a bit more grace to these ultra woke nonprofits like the audubon society when they pull stuns like this because you almost expect it at this point and it's less jarring because you know you're a non-profit you're already very progressive with all your environmental stuff i get it it's when the big corporations i mean it's one north face did that whole you know schtick when burger king is now having you know whoppers with two bottoms or two tops you know to pick you know whichever one you are whichever gay you are it's like are you kidding me like just sell food just sell jackets whatever it is leave these kinds of stunts to the nonprofits they can run themselves into the ground if they want to but i actually would like to be able to buy you know a north face jacket with a clear conscience that's my whole rant i guess it is interesting i feel like you can't escape the drag stuff this year i mean honestly when did it start because now we're seeing drag queens everywhere in schools and political events they are the front of pride i feel like every pride advertisement involves some kind of drag queen and before it was just kind of entertainment adjacent to the lgbtq plus community but now it is almost like the drag queens are the lgbtq community why is this the hill that we're all going to die on it's a genuine question the left is defending all the drag stuff to the death to the end with them being in schools taking being able to take kids to bars and the ride is latching on for good reason and like this is our this is the pinnacle this is the issue that we are literally fighting day in and day out i don't know how it happened we are literally living in the upside down if anybody has any thoughts about when this thing took off let me know but for now i'm gonna go drink some coffee and calm down because my heart is still racing after seeing a bird dance on my screen for two minutes so that's what i'm gonna go do hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "PuifePXNq9E": "day 37 of being a girl it's Easter and Jesus is not the only thing that has risen this morning I was checking my body out as I normally do and I looked down in my hip area and I have stretch marks and this is the first Telltale sign that I've had that the hormones are working and they're doing it their job and uh oh let me show you my my Easter outfit fit check fit check got my Goose purse I got some really fun little shoes on and I don't even have anywhere to go today I'm just gonna lay in bed but I love a holiday so happy Easter they're the most relatable part of this video is I'm not gonna go anywhere today I'm just gonna lay in bed like these videos make me so conflicted because this person genuinely seems joyful but it's so weird somebody says stretch marks is just skin tensile I mean I do like the positivity about the stretch marks like that's a good thing the whole like Jesus is not the only one who has risen I thought that was going in a different direction guys", "YgSOrnBeNKw": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper you guys need to get excited because Sports Brett is back to sports we are talking about sports again I know that that is your very favorite thing to see me talk about because obviously I know everything about sports I am the sports ball girl uh no obviously not at all but today we're actually going to talk about a sport that I somehow what know a little bit about but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a comment section episode and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection Kyrie Irving I should actually I remember he is the Brooklyn is it Nets or jets sports ball Kyrie Irving is trending Kyrie Irving is a basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets he's been around for a while and he's been in the news a lot in the last couple of years because he was one of the very few NBA players that publicly said that he was not going to get vaccinated obviously got a ton of pushback but now he is trending again like all over Twitter and at this rate you would expect that he had refused another vaccine was talking about the vaccine or he fully retired or did something else completely insane but no all he did was repost an Alex Jones video on his Instagram story oh man I'm sorry that is literally all he did articles are being written about him people are tweeting him dragging him through the mud because he had the audacity to repost something on his story when I tell you that these people are crazy and they will find any single thing to like nitpick and rip you apart about this is what I mean but even this is you know more significant than some of the other instances like remember when Carrie Underwood liked one of Matt Walsh's tweets and there was a whole media Firestorm like oh is she conservative like yeah she probably is she's a good old girl from Oklahoma who shoots guns and sings country music do I care no anyway that's just another example of it but like I said they will find any reason to tear you apart Daily Beast was the first one to pick up this story uh and they said Kyrie Irving unfortunately shared a 2002 Infowars video on Thursday in which Alex Jones rants about secret societies corrupt Empires and government overlords supposedly wanting worldwide Rule and a cashless society and total and complete tyranny and then they wrote an entire article about it the title is Kyrie Irving shares unhinged Alex Jones clip about secret societies and Engineering viruses our news media is a literal dumpster fire if this is what they are spending their Thursday night writing about this is not news it is news and content for me but not for you there are much more important things going on in the world other than Kyrie Irving reposting something on his Instagram story this is the video he shared we have to watch it it's from the free thought project which is a great Instagram account you should follow them if you don't the facts in common sense Arena and yes there have been corrupt Empires yes they manipulate yes there are secret societies yes there have been oligarchies throughout history and yes today in 2002 there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order pushing for worldwide government a cashless Society total and complete tyranny by centralizing and socializing Health Care the state becomes God basically when it comes to your health and then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us we then basically get shoved into their system where human beings are absolutely worthless what is incorrect in that video that was in 2002 the caption on this is Alex Jones tried to warn us yes he did we might not call this the New World Order anymore but you really have to have your head in the sand if you have not educated yourself about the world economic Forum about the great reset this is not a conspiracy theory they literally have conferences every single year about how they are going to centralize every aspect of Our Lives how they want us to be cashless how they want us to own nothing they are controlling Our Food Supplies from a top-down approach we do live in an authoritarian regime right now there is a book that you can buy on Amazon from the world economic Forum about how they wanted to use they meaning the the globalist elites explain how they intended to use covid-19 to push us towards that globalist future it might sound crazy because we have to wrap our head around it but it is happening yes Alex Jones is a showman he knows how to push people's buttons he knows how to soak a fire but when you boil down what he is trying to say and what he's trying to warn us about he gets it right and he got it right in 2002 and Kyrie Irving knows it they just started saying it publicly in front of cameras what we are very proud of now is a Young Generation like prime minister Trudeau if these Elites had their way we would be eating bugs right now which is why it is so important to stock up on meat in the best way that you can do that is through my favorite meat delivery service good ranchers I love good ranchers because their quality is literally unbeatable their beef is pasture raised and USDA prime or upper Choice beef and their chicken is also pasture raised with no added hormones or antibiotics and their Prime Seafood is caught fresh and then flash frozen and vacuum sealed so that when it arrives to your door the quality is still locked in if you want to try them out go to goodranchers.com Cooper and then use promo code Cooper at checkout for 30 off of your order plus free shipping again that is goodranchers.com Cooper promo code Cooper at checkout because if Alex Jones is right we're gonna need that meat and Kyrie seems to be warning us of that thankfully the replies to this Daily Beast article were based and it was a major white pill somebody said I trust Kyrie before I trust a lot of y'all another person said why do you say unfortunately like it's something bad that happened to him as opposed to something he decided to do and had complete control over well it's because they have this personal stake in our opinions and our beliefs it's very very weird and twisted I remember when I first started posting on my social media about my political beliefs I think I like re-shared a prageru video and you know made some posts on my story and I had a really good friend from UCLA text me and he was like I am I am just so heartbroken at you know what they have done to you and and what you've become and I was like what what they've done to me what I've become like why do you care it's not your life but they they have such an investment in you falling into line that they can't stand whenever you go against the grain another person said wow Kyrie Irving based another one said he ain't lying though another person said I think Kyrie can think whatever the hell he wants it's a revolutionary idea he and Alex Jones they are not wrong the world economic Forum authoritarianism the cashless Society it is all happening I need to put up this tweet again welcome to 2030. I own nothing I have no privacy and life has ever been better that is literally something that the world economic Forum posted in 2017 and they have been slowly working to that ever since I mean have you guys been reading the articles about how no Millennials or members of gen Z can buy homes and uh here's another tweet about how Starbucks is now going cashless much like many other businesses we are slowly pulling cash out of our world yeah it's all slowly happening whether or not you want to believe it other people on Twitter though were not so thrilled or clearly not as based somebody said Kyrie is definitely the first case of basketball induced CTE got you people somebody else said Kyrie is not even into cool conspiracy he on that lame early 2000 tell me lemons are a fake fruit or something yeah it's because this isn't a conspiracy sorry to burst your bubble go find something else to talk about another one said me after Kyrie Irving shares an Alex Jones conspiracy video Just Smile politely y'all were witnessing mental illness oh these people have no life the other person said Kyrie being Stephen A Stephen A Smith's uh MVP picked for next season after he spent this entire year running his name into the ground it's just pure comedy to me yes so this is actually true so Stephen A Smith I think he's like the highest paid anchor reporter at ESPN he's super famous I only know him from like viral videos and memes basically I am having a very bad day today it's one of the worst days that I've had in a long time I'm not in the mood to play with anybody he spent all of the last year and a half absolutely dragging Kyrie through the mud about vaccines about everything that he said about his political beliefs I mean ripping into him much like he ripped into basically every player that did not fall into line and then literally two days ago he's on his show and he says that Kyrie Irving is his MVP pick like what let me tell you something right now I'm not only going to we'll revisit this another time I'll go a step further I got Kyrie Irving as one of my top League MVP candidates I think Kyrie Irving gonna put on a show this year everybody better brace themselves because the brother playing for a new contract he playing for a new contract listen it matters 200 million dollars I mean I appreciate that they're bringing capitalism into this because if my contract was about to be renewed and I had to you know put my heart and soul out there to get the money yeah I do it and I think any reasonable person would do it and truth be told Kyrie is an awesome player like I remember him playing with the Cavaliers in 2016 against the Warriors in the finals and he was awesome he was up there with Steph and I say this as somebody who loves the Warriors and saw Steph Curry play for the first time in Chattanooga when he was still you know playing at Davidson but he's incredible and he just hasn't really been on the court recently because everybody's been so pissed at him I'm excited to see him play and I'm glad that somebody in the mainstream media is you know uplift lifting him even though they did just drag his name through the mud for the last year maybe we can find some sort of equilibrium in a balanced reporting that would be incredible absolutely shocking in 2022. this is kind of a quintessential situation where you do have to separate like the artist from the art whatever because he's had controversies even before the vaccine and all this political stuff because I think he's been on record saying some flat earther stuff so it's just kind of how you have to roll with Kyrie let the man play and if you don't agree with him ignore it and move on but I did see this comment that really stood out to me sort of about this this person said white liberals beyond that shut up and dribble  too I don't know why they act like they're so much better than conservatives as soon as Kyrie says some  that's not a popular opinion amongst them they basically tell him to shut up and dribble yes it's absolutely true and in classic form Libs accuse us of something that they do literally every single day shutting down voices that they disagree with but I would argue that most bass people people on the right conservatives whatever they don't subscribe to the shut up and dribble ideology that most people put on them individual players they have the right to voice their opinions just like Kyrie just like LeBron I can either agree with you I can also think that you're an idiot like LeBron but what we disagree with in my opinion is an entire league or sport politicizing itself and turning against its own audience and some of its players and basically saying like you can't enjoy our game if you are not on our side of the political aisle because when it comes to the game yeah shut up and dribble but off the court the players can do whatever they want it's their life who am I to tell them what to think guys we are adding new comment

out at the beginning of the weekend and it caused quite a stir and i really can't explain anything more so we just have to watch it this is what some mexicans are calling modern colonialism the heavy influx of americans moving to mexico city to take advantage of lower living costs other locals are calling it gentrification a plague or even an invasion what behind you oh my god you're thinking of moving to mexico city wow one simple recommendation gentrification is the name of the game critics say the flood of americans has caused an increase in the cost of basic necessities for locals rent has more than doubled for some this is not to mention that mexico city residents already spend an average of 60 of their income on housing the same people moving are the same ones who complain when immigrants come to america and of course natives are upset as they should be many americans moving to mexico city are working remotely and still getting paid in u.s dollars some locals have benefited from increasing tourism but for many that doesn't balance out rising costs in inflation mexicans are also fed up with americans ignoring cultural and social norms and some complain that in certain places english is more common than spanish local businesses are being forced to shut down and replaced by cafes and pilates studios people who live in mexico city and people who work in mexico city including myself we want to get a place but it's really difficult because the prices are so high and even with a good salary it's very difficult you're still bragging about how cheap it is and how it's not even like a quarter of your rent in l.a and it's messed up right there's so much to unpack here let's just start from those tick tocks that they mixed into the video where the girl is like oh my god i see white people behind me white americans and that guy going do not come back like violence you are coming in and taking or whatever imagine if a white american made one of those videos about people immigrating into our country all hell would break loose and i know i talk about the double standards a lot i know i talk about the hypocrisy and some people like i've said before go this isn't doing anything but i hope that at some point it makes at least one person wake up to the double standard that we are living in every single day because we are not allowed to say we want strong borders and you know we don't want people coming in and taking our jobs you know hey we want legal immigration when we say that it's racist but you can make an entire video and have l.a times articles written up about it have the news talking about how mexicans are so upset that americans are moving there and they are infiltrating their culture it is ridiculous and i'm not saying that they are in the wrong i'm just pointing out like this is not a level playing field in the slightest that line about pilates studios they're coming in starting pilates studios and there's some areas where they speak more english than spanish i'm sorry have you been to south texas have you been to la or san diego like that is not a new phenomena at all somebody said uh when america sends its people they're not sending their best they're sending people that have a lot of problems they're bringing those problems with us they're bringing pilates they're bringing avocado toast they're influencers and some i assume are good people god that's classic um yeah i'm so sorry to all the people in mexico city for the influx of avocado toast i'm sure it's like 15 there as well it's not worth it make it at home um somebody else said i was told this attitude was xenophobic or racist or something yeah same here another person said diversity is now your greatest strength also oh my god somebody said maybe they want to build a wall do you want to build a wall yeah okay so now maybe mexico wants to pay for the wall maybe now or now the turntables that's the next comment is how the turntables thank you michael scott am i a hero i really can't say but yes maybe now that americans are coming in they're going to build a wall and make us pay for it somebody said don't you see that that says more about the us though i don't know why y'all are celebrating this if it means the quality of life in the u.s is so poor that they are moving out to other countries if our quality of life is so poor then why are there still millions of people flooding across our borders both legally and illegally yes america has problems we are in the midst of chaos dumpster fire right now but we still have ideals and values and opportunities that you cannot get in other places and you know mexico don't get so high and mighty because people are still coming to america every single day so you're not the cream of the crop just like apparently we are not the cream of the crop anymore i don't know but like the immigration problem in our border states is so severe and unaddressed the governors like greg abbott are bussing immigrants up to dc and nyc i mean there was literally a new york post article a couple of weeks ago that said mayor eric adams says that nyc has received almost 7 600 migrants since may oh my god and once all of these migrants were bused up to new york city he turned around and finally realized the strain that they take on a city and the economy here's his video about it this is a real burden on new yorkers as we're trying to do the right thing uh we already as i stated we already have an overburdened shelter system so now we're talking about as you stated food clothing school this is going to impact our of our schools because we do not turn away individuals because they're undocumented uh translation services there's just a whole host of things that this is going to produce and that's why we need we need help and getting this done and we need to write coordination to make it happen fine by me i mean honestly like let's look back at that new york post article where eric adams has received less than 10 000 additional migrants from texas and suddenly he is wailing about resources and homelessness and crime i mean imagine what the border states deal with it is not bigotry to want strong borders it is not xenophobia to want legal pathways to immigration it is not racism or a hate crime to want to build a wall or protect your country we all know that and now so does mexico guys

structures of the new one [Music] mega bloks mega highways mega city one bear i fixed the voice over for you guys welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper today we are going to be doing a little bit of dystopia a little bit of george soros's dream a little bit of the new world order so exciting everybody's favorite topics but before we get into a discussion about a dystopian hellhole remember to like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode matt walsh retweeted this video on his twitter account and i watched it and i thought that it was a joke i thought that it was some a.i weird thing the beginning of a sci-fi movie i'm sorry dave i'm afraid i can't do that but boy was i wrong for too long humanity has existed within dysfunctional and polluted cities that ignore nature now a revolution in civilization is taking place imagine a traditional city and consolidating its footprint designing to protect and enhance nature the line will be home to nine million residents and will be built with a footprint of just 34 square kilometers and we are designing it to provide a healthier more sustainable quality of life the lines communities are organized in three dimensions residents have access to all their daily needs within five-minute walk neighborhoods and the lines infrastructure makes it possible to travel end-to-end in 20 minutes with no need for cars resulting in zero carbon emissions by leveraging ai technology services are autonomous saving you time and effort designed by world leading architects the line is 500 meters tall 200 meters wide 170 kilometers long and housed within an elegant mirror glass facade intelligent solutions create efficiency and year-round temperate microclimate with natural ventilation energy and water supplies are 100 renewable the line is designed as a series of unique communities offering a wealth of amenities providing equitable views and immediate access to the surrounding nature with 40 of the world accessible within six hours at the heart of the globe's key trade routes a place for commerce and communities to thrive like nothing on earth seen before the line the city that delivers new wonders for the world this is literally a dystopian nightmare equitable views your little pod communities this is the whole you will own nothing and be happy you will eat bugs you will live in pods you will live in a small glass chamber i'm sorry zero carbon how much carbon is it going to take to build that entire thing this honestly feels like some weird creepy dystopian inverted version of halo [Music] god i mean seriously these progressive ideas are just getting creepier and weirder by the day like all of this is just such a recipe for chaos and instability which is why it is so great the bullion max has you covered with inflation hitting 9.1 percent which is a 40-year high in ideas like this floating around it is more important than ever to make sure that you are financially secure the best way to do that is with bullying max bullion max is a direct to consumer retailer of precious metals you can buy online you never have to talk with a salesperson your shipment is fully insured and i have a special offer for you you can get bullion max's silver starter kit at employee pricing if you use promo code cooper at checkout this kit includes five of the most desirable silver medals that you can invest in this offer is limited to one per household so go to bullionmax.com cooper because guys you need to invest in these precious metals before the freaks take over i thought that this was a joke it's not a joke please leave again i thought that this was some you know weird person on the internet who just made this no it is an actual thing so i have an article about it saudi arabia wants to build this bizarre city dubbed the line the ambitious project sounds like something from a dystopian sci-fi movie about the death of the planet that's basically what we are living in right now this is just greta thundberg's dream i think how dare you so saudi arabia is developing a new city 150 stories tall and built from scratch that will serve as a semi-closed environment where people can live and work without ever stepping afoot outside that sounds horrifying i'm not even claustrophobic and that sounds horrific like you'll need to go outside we have rooftops with trees don't leave the compound saudi arabia is building a cult that's what they're doing and while the promotional videos released monday are likely an attempt to give the development a utopian feel that recalls so many intentional cities of the 20th century the project comes across as extremely dystopian no all right so it's completely walled on four sides with some sort of ventilation on top yeah i would hope that it would have some ventilation on top they've gone according to the promotional videos we'll feature cutting-edge technology along with high-speed transportation from end-to-end cars will be completely unnecessary the video uploaded to twitter proclaims that this new city will house nine million residents to provide a more healthy and sustainable quality of life okay give me a break the video is giving this whole aura of it being so beautiful and sustainable i think it's creepy but they're hoping that people will think that it's some sort of stunning utopia but have you ever seen the government do anything effectively this is going to turn into the slumps when everybody when nine million people cram into a tiny little thing it will be the slums it will be like some kind of cold war era apartment building with everybody crammed inside i mean this is just another example of how the progressive movement in the world is always so interested in moving us backwards being regressive they want to be anti-racist by being racist they want to move us into the future by literally taking our living situations back to where we were a hundred years ago does not sound very progressive to me you weird dystopian architects i am the architect residents will have access to all of their daily needs within five minute walk neighborhoods so we're just not gonna leave our houses we're all gonna be on our pelotons and that's how we're gonna get exercise no fresh air you can go up to your ventilation unit sniff some artificial trees so then the article goes on and says as they mentioned earlier this is far from the first time that an incredibly expansive planned community has taken shape even amazon founder jeff bezos showed off something similar in 2019 albeit his plan is for space colony jeff i am not going anywhere with you either my dude you and your weird man boobs oh actually no that's bill gates let's see whether it was george pullman's hyper-capitalist town in chicagoland the drug-free cult of cyanon in california or upton sinclair's socialist cooperative in new jersey history has shown intentional communities are often ruined by the egos of the people building them and there is arguably no bigger ego in the planet than the developer of this city mr bonesaw himself muhammad bin salman i don't know who this man is but apparently he has an ego and he believes that he has the brightest mind in architecture well it sure is shiny they're trying to make you give up everything give up your transportation give up your land give up your property everything to live in a small little apartment in a glass hallway land of the free you are ultimately giving up your freedom to this development absolutely not and i know that this is just you know one intentional community and it's trending on twitter and all of that but this is actually the future that so many environmentalists so many new world order great reset elites want for us they want us controlled in these tiny little environments with no freedom no power and that's not a conspiracy at all and if you think that it is i don't know what to tell you just go take a peruse on the world economic forum read the damn book do your own research i was happy the most people that i saw online were weirded out by it even that article that's from a more lib leaning publication was like this is dystopian it's kind of weird thank god when he posted it matt said this is an exciting opportunity for anyone who has ever dreamed of living in a termite colony my friend kongman tweeted i thought walls don't work there we go we're all gonna live in one now another person posted this and said better than living in something like this this is probably in san francisco my god it's so disgusting if i had to pick between that and the utopia at least you can leave this we have so many problems and they are not going to be fixed by rounding up everybody and cramming them into a utopia you're just gonna make a lot of claustrophobic mentally struggling people go even more insane somebody else said what exactly happens to everybody's land and property in this scenario you don't have it anymore this one guy was pressed about it and said no one is forcing you to live in it or anywhere near it it's a design for a sustainable city built in an arid climate to suit our environment i don't understand the hatred aimed at this is it because it is in saudi arabia because white nations didn't build it first this is not about race it is about the fact that this is objectively weird and creepy i'm sorry if i am offending you and your country's innovation i don't want the western world to build this first i don't want us to build it at all if you're so happy with it that is great you can move in you can be first on the wait list i will be all the way over here with my cows somebody else said what a fancy looking prison imagine all the hobos taking a dump down the line from way up top or how it would be to live on the bottom even without that my god can you imagine the stench [Music] this is like they watched all of those social media videos of people staying in their apartments in italy during covid singing to each other across the way never leaving and they thought this is a great idea long term it's not whatever your name is mr egotistical developer it's not so take your head out of your ass go put your money elsewhere please do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "7im2vRMXJKM": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I actually have some kind of sad cultural news for you guys today because everybody's favorite comfort show this is just kind of a cultural institution if you will has angered the woke mob the Great British Bake Off is on The Chopping Block but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection in the current season of The Great British Bake Off that is now airing on Netflix they had a Mexico week where the contestants would have to you know Embrace another culture and bake that culture's pastries whatever it did not go as well as anybody expected to say the least let's just watch some clips so that you guys know what everybody is so angry about so it's Mexico a real place I think so well I think it's like Xanadu by Oz yeah like clear thoughts okay although I don't feel like we should make Mexican jokes because people get upset well not even one I mean listen at least they're self-aware like we can't make these jokes are gonna be offensive not even one no no but calm down I'm gonna get Rosa for this because I'm appropriating British culture okay now I have to hear this woman Say guacamole this is a short one guys just listen where to put the glockimolo that is real um here's another one this one they're saying pico de gallo you've got a Pikachu pico de gallo Pico so bad uh here's another one they're talking about the culture of Mexico Mexico is full of vibrancy colors they look beautiful and they look Mexican there were lots of bright colors so to look like Mexico you must just have lots of colors that's basically just it all right here we go this we're going to end with this little clip aracas foreign by the way literally looks like him like nobody looks like they're having a good time but at least like I said at least they're self-aware they know that they are being over the top they know that they are being ridiculous and I don't think anybody with a rational mind would see any of this as violence or problematic or racism but of course that's what the internet is saying somebody said I've never before thought that I could do better while watching The Great British Bake off until I saw them making guacamole yeah like I'm sorry there's a little old lady on the show she was peeling an avocado for her guacamole or whatever it is like a potato here she is look at that like ma'am this is out of potato this is not an apple but again it is not racism it is just corny and it is ridiculous it is sweet little British people who thought that they were coming on the Great British Bake Off to make tea cakes and coconut macaroons and suddenly they are being told to make steak tacos and like this steak did not even look that good they should have gotten good ranchers to sponsor the damn week because good ranchers only source is the highest quality meat for their customers their beef is either USDA prime or upper Choice their chicken is better than organic because it has no added hormones or antibiotics and the fish is caught fresh and then flash frozen so that when it's delivered to your door you know that you are getting the best possible quality and the best part is unlike basically every other grocery store good ranchers has never had to do a meat recall because they have a 100 satisfaction guarantee you get two pounds of wagyu ground beef and 2.5 pounds of their better than organic chicken and that comes free when you buy one of their bundle boxes so go to goodranchers.com Cooper promo code Cooper at checkout your tacos will turn out better than whatever these poor British people were making talking on the Great British Bake Off and you know many of these rationally minded people in the comments pointed out that while you can get a lot of ethnic food in the UK Mexican food is really not one of the options so the Bakers really should not be blamed at all but of course people are staying mad I mean look at these mainstream media headlines this is making national news like deadline said that the Great British Bake Off is perpetrating a hundred-year-old stereotypes during Mexico themed week here's another one 11 times Great British Banking show proved that it's not good anymore Great British Bake Off faces backlash things to do instead of watching Mexican week on the Great British Bake Off like everybody's talking about this and Twitter has been in a fury this person said look I've laughed as much as the next person about the cringe Fest that was Mexican week on Great British Bake Off but the truth is that this is just another instance of latinx latinx cultures being reduced to costumes and the lack of interest in learning about us for real particularly in the UK calm down we do this to every culture somebody said if you're morbidly curious about the Mexican week of Great British Bake Off it is so violently racist whatever you're imagining it is much worse it is violently racist the way that they're appealing that avocado calm down Brandy get a life somebody said I talked to CNN about Great British Bake Off Mexico week and how this is exactly the kind of offensive and ignorant content that happens when Productions lack diversity on and off camera wow that's new never heard that line before as a Brit I can tell you that the Great British Bake off's Mexican week episode is pretty much a perfect master class for the uninitiated on the very specific kind of casual racism that is British casual racism like I promise you guys it is not that deep it is not violently racist or even casually racist like have you seen the way other countries depict Americans how we depict British people and French people like it goes both ways this is a two four five-way Street we make other countries and cultures into caricatures that is not violence that is humor I don't know if these people have ever heard of it like somebody said in my head there's a Mexican Bake Off currently airing which is having a British week where everybody's talking like Dick Van Dyke and Mary Poppins as they're baking a fish and chips flavored Victoria sponge now if I had to offer some criticisms or suggestions for this Great British Bake Off week segment I would say maybe don't set your poor British makers up for failure and please don't use judges that clearly don't know what they're talking about like I said I don't blame the Bakers for any of this Ridiculousness but the producers like come on guys like it it just really wasn't that funny it was cringe maybe that's what you're going for and you pulled it off but it wasn't offensive it just wasn't great should they get canceled no absolutely not but should they get ridiculed yes because they made themselves look like idiots but that's not the worst crime in the entire world it could have been really cool if they had brought somebody in to explain some interesting Mexican desserts and help the poor British people my God know that you do not peel an avocado like this also why are they making steak tacos on the Great British Bake Off like do you really not think that there are any other Mexican desserts that you could do I'm not even offended or think that it's problematic I just think that it's not well thought out and kind of ridiculous like guys this is not racism it is corny not well executed television Get a Grip Go Touch grass hey hey I can't believe that you're about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "ZuFYP4st4bw": "[Music] foreign welcome back to another episode of off the clock so as you guys know I have been watching Star Wars I watched the OT the original trilogy so now I think that I have a general understanding of things obviously I've seen your guys's comments and you're saying Brett you need to watch the prequels you need to watch the shows all that stuff I'll get there there's only so much time in the world and sheller has determined that first I need to be tormented by Halloween movies and then I need to watch Lord of the Rings and then I probably will Circle back jensaki style and watch more of Star Wars but anyway in the time being I thought you know I've done a bunch of quizzes about like Harry Potter what character I am but I have never done a Star Wars character test because I would just I would have no idea what was going on but now I do I'm a Star Wars person now so my producers have pulled a quiz for me to take with you all today and I'm actually feeling very aligned with Star Wars right now I don't know if this is a stretch maybe people have been saying this for the last two years but I was just you know oblivious because I've never seen Star Wars but you know we kind of are the Rebellion we have an awful authoritarian government our economy is literally being run into the ground which is why it is so important to diversify your portfolio with bully and Max because when the bottom falls out of the stock market it's good to have something tangible to hold on to something that cannot be impacted by a deranged leader like Joe Biden or Darth Vader and I'm obviously talking about gold and silver and the best way to start investing in these medals is through bully and Max Boolean Max is a direct to Consumer precious metals retailer you can do everything online without ever having to talk to a salesperson and then they will ship your medals directly to your door fully insured I mean it is literally the most hassle-free process ever and for my viewers I have put together a special patriotic silver starter kit just for you you can go to booleanmax.com Cooper to redeem it again it is bullyingmax.com Cooper go check them out go get started diversifying your portfolio I mean literally guys the time is right now because Nancy Pelosi the AKA Emperor Palpatine or maybe actually that's class Suave I don't know either of them they're coming for us Joe Biden is just the puppet but I digress back to Star Wars if you want to pull it up you can take it alongside of me and we can see what we can get you can leave it in the comments should be very fun all right here we go Star Wars character test also we've used this quiz platform before and the most recent one I did was this one about being a feminist and it literally said like this quiz has no no bias no anything and then they immediately started asking questions about like Trump and abortion and all of this stuff so I wonder if they're going to enter politics into this but let me say why use this test it's free of charge you can figure out your things statistical controls made of professionals I guess because it's not political they don't need to say it's non-partisan even though it definitely is partisan for sure anyway okay here we go I'm just gonna start I appear shy and reserved though not without an inner jokester that nobody would ever call me shy and reserved ever I was very shy growing up though very very shy so I started doing theater because my mom was like you need to like go talk to people and perform and be on stage because you're literally hiding in the cupboard I would do that there was a cupboard in our first Chattanooga house and it's where I kept all of my like kid cooking tools like things that I could make little you know things of cereal or Play-Doh that kind of thing I would just go sit in it and then in our second house it was on the mountain in Chattanooga we had this whole like china cabinet and underneath it we just didn't have anything in it because we had most of the stuff like on top in the glass and I would just go sit in that cupboard anyway it was after that it was after a few years of that that my mom said you need to go be more outgoing so anyway not anymore okay question two I noticed slips and oversights that are not immediately apparent to others uh yeah moderately agree just because I can be pretty critical I'm not like detailed detail-oriented but if there's a problem I will address it and fix it and I'm pretty quick to notice uh I view most people as Expendable I disagree when I think of the future I know in my heart the good will prevail over evil um I don't know I I mean I try to be pretty white pilled but sometimes with the content that I talk about on the normal show it gets a little depressing I'm gonna say neutral I don't know at this point I'm gonna Maybe moderately agree I'm gonna be positive I'm gonna be positive I take a stand for what I believe in yeah you can say that again I take the time to understand others in depth and help them grow in an individualized way I'd say yet moderately agree because if there's somebody that I care about and that I respect I'll obviously take the time to do that if I don't respect you if I don't care if I don't feel like you you know warrant my time and energy no I'm not gonna give myself to you not altruistic in that way I think like never-ending altruism is like a death sentence for yourself but for good people yeah absolutely I have a no-nonsense attitude with little patience for others incompetence absolutely agree yes I will always try to help my friends no matter what yeah moderately agree unless okay here's the thing with my friends if you come to me for help or advice like constantly about the same issue and I give you the same advice and then you just don't take it if you come to me again after the third time I'm just gonna be like okay fine figure it on your own so then I'll stop helping and then if you come to me with a different issue we can start the cycle over again but at some point we draw the line in the sand my friends you have to protect yourself also it just helps people take accountability I mislead people so as to keep them in the dark about my true motives no that's just that helps nobody I always try to do what I can to further the well-being of others uh I would agree there are only two ways of doing something my way in the wrong way I disagree I mean like if I was gonna answer that very quickly I would say obviously there's my way but it's obviously much more complex than that but before I catch myself I probably would have answered that like obviously I'd probably social harmony and strive to minimize negative criticisms that ruin the mood moderately disagree I don't really like the word social harmony I don't really care I want things to be effective I want things to be productive and move us all forward in some kind of like positive way but I'm not trying to like sit around a zinc Kumbaya at the expense of everything else so again moderately disagree I frighten others to get what I want no unlike the skit that we did when I hit a million subscribers that's not actually me it was funny I had somebody on my team who came to me and he was like Brett you're very easy to work with you great but you need to not be a doormat sometimes and it wasn't like in a very aggressive way it was just like sometimes I'll be like oh it's fine I'll just handle it I'll handle it and he was like no sometimes you have to ask people to do things and you can't just fix it yourself like say hey you said you were gonna do this you're gonna do it and that's just me I think learning how to you know I don't know work in this environment I have no idea so disagree no I do not do that I am intent on kindness and cooperation showing respect for other people's uh feelings and views neutral I think I mean yes I share respect for other people's feelings and Views but I like cooperation it feels like they smushed a bunch in there I would say moderately great because again we gotta cut to the chase sometimes I said this question is like right after I was saying that I can sort of be a doormat but it's like I would say moderately it really depends on the situation uh I'm quick to act and quick to get results oh hell yeah my mom used to get so mad at me growing up because number one I would say things before they were fully thought out and without thinking and then second of all I would just start doing things immediately without actually having agreeing on what I was going to be doing like she would say oh maybe you know we could do this and she's explaining it and I'm like five miles ahead like right I'll go ahead and start doing it I'll make the calls I'll do it I just want to get it done efficiency I just want things to happen move forward move along so we can continue doing other things and obviously my mom is like that as well we are very similar but she would be trying to get a point across and I just wouldn't listen and I was like a steamroller so I've tried to work on that I stay with the task at hand for as long as the project requires I would say moderately agree um I'll stay on it if progress is being made but if I feel like there's a lot of incompetence or progress really isn't being made and there's nothing I can do I'll get out because there's other things that require my attention I'm constantly seeking to turn problems into Solutions and may come across overbearing in my eagerness to move forward I to moderately agree I'm very positive about it I'm not angry but I will put pressure but I'm very happy about it like come on guys let's make things happen but I I will never like be angry or intimidate people I don't mind cutting Quarters here and there moderately disagree um because I don't want to you know skimp out on things but I also think in a lot of situations I feel like there's we get too bogged down with details I'm not a detailed person at all and so I will kind of I will cut quarters there that's why I did not do well in statistics oh that was awful that was the worst math class I could have ever taken in college because you have to be like down to the decimal specific then I was like five or six what difference does it make is one number oh what makes all the difference I failed that midterm when I cried it was the first time I ever got a B in my entire life awful uh others refer to me as nurturing patient considerate um I would say I'm nurturing in some senses I would say moderately agree yeah I've had to work on my patients a lot I would say I'm pretty nurturing especially my personal life and I'm a pretty considerate person patience has been something that I've really had to work on though I'm not naturally patient I just get very like jittery and I need to move things forward but it is something that I have learned so I would say probably we'll see what my team thinks about this when they see it we agree I devise extensive schemes in my own mind and have great confidence in them oh 100 I'm way overconfident overconfidence is probably my greatest flaw and one of my growth strengths though I retain the spirit of optimism even in subpar situations I would say moderately agree people see me as independent strong-willed and intense yes yeah I was moderate my intensity has been lowered a little bit I'm not kidding like high school beginning of college I've said it before stick up my ass so intense you would not have seen me as like a doormat whatsoever you would have not seen me as uh patient or nurturing or anything but I've really calmed that I also think I had a lot of walls up because of things going on in my family at the time and I felt like I just needed to be you know in control of as many things as possible because the rest of my life was so out of control and I feel like I'm in a good place now where I don't have this intrinsic need to be like freaking out and you know have walls up around everything and as a result I feel like that's allowed me to relax a little and breathe a bit but man those years that was rough I like had never cried before I was super anxious all the time but like that kind of like anger anxious so it's calmed down but intrinsically I still am a you know more intense person my problems with authority and or commitment uh no disagree no disagree I have a natural way with people which encourages them to be their best selves I do I do think I have an actuary with people I hope that I encourage them to be their best selves I feel like if I say agree I'm just being overconfident but like I said I'm always overconfident so maybe yeah sure people seem happy around me I'd lean over to see if my producer was like I think it's fine yeah I pursue goals with a tunnel vision drive that may come across as neglectful of other people's feelings and Views I'd say moderately agree because again I've gotten better at it I'm a bit more tolerant I'm I can be laid back not really but I can come across some more laid back in my mind I'm a one-track mind but we're working on it uh I don't like being rushed to my work I don't feel like these when I do not have the time to contemplate oh disagree I want to be more rushed I feel a primal protectiveness towards those I care about absolutely agree I have a preference for Action intended dislike theoretical hair splitting yes oh god oh wait I said disagree there we go agree I speak out against the injustices I have witnessed is that going to make me a social justice Warrior them I really agree just because I hate the word and justice but I feel like I speak out about important things but because of that word moderately agree people see me as contemplative holistic and insightful holistic maybe moderately agree I mean I have like 1.3 million of you guys who listen to things I have to say so I would hope that it's insightful unless you're just here for shits and giggles so I will say moderately agree without saying agree because I don't want to come across as a okay you know it's awareness others see me as tough-minded realistic and direct I'd say moderately agree on that as well it depends on the subject I'm speaking on there are some things where I really a lot of people have it and other times where I'm laughing more so again I think it just depends I can be goofy and joke around one minute and then deadly serious the next uh agree I think that's the best way to live life because if you're not laughing or crying vice versa uh I am not as upset as others when somebody dies um um um it's interesting I I kind of want to say maybe I just have to be neutral on this because so my brother died when I was very young and as a result I have a lot of empathy when you know somebody dies in somebody's life um and I'm hearing about that because I've been there and I've had a lot of loss in my family but that was like my very first experience which kind of like sent me on this path um but in the grand scheme of things when you know other people are going through things I can feel sort of numb to it because you know I've already been through it and I've you know helped a lot of people through it and so it doesn't impact me as much but I would actually say disagree I think Jess from the empathy standpoint just because I know I think like objectively I can distance myself from it a little more because I've been there and I'm so rational but I think what I think about the empathy yeah I think that's better because like I'll see stories of like kids whose like siblings have died and that sort of thing and I mean it wrecks me just because I know um I have often been referred to as adaptable Lively and quick-witted yeah I agree um I want those who have challenged me to fail no I kind of I mean depends on the person but I really haven't had people who have challenged me I would say disagreeing there's room for all of us it's fine unless you've been like an or something then I think Karma's gonna come get you and that's gonna be your own fault but no it's fine okay Finish who am I Leia okay we have Leia Obi-Wan and then a mixture of Luke and Yoda I'm glad I'm not Emperor Palpatine well yeah as a Princess Leia was expected to play a certain role by people around her she could have led an easy comfortable life if she had done it she was told and acted as a figurehead there was only one problem with this Leia had other ideas it kind of reminds me of when I was acting instead I decided to do all this all right she worries about the Galaxy and people in it and feels compelled to be a voice for justice and fairness her Duty uh her sense of Duty is unparalleled um she gives her all to the causes she believes in cool I'm not mad about that I would have been more upset if I was Luke because I do believe in that first movie he was a beta cuck and he annoyed me Leia annoyed me a tiny bit in the first movie I just feel like her character wasn't totally developed but in the second and the third I was totally on board uh so I'm not upset with this at all uh drop in the comments if you took this quiz what you got what your percentages are I don't even think we need the Enneagram anymore we just need this you can find out your

"fnYtkxHBC8I": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper i don't think it's a secret anymore not that i was ever trying to hide it uh but i don't think it is a secret that i was a theater kid in the slightest it is how i got into acting in the first place i did tons of community theater and then i went and did regional theater and then i was doing professional theater and then i was in new york all that stuff so i am like the quintessential musical theater broadway kid i am unashamed in the fact that i do belt broadway songs in my car i love the show glee and i'm not afraid to say it so by default i do really enjoy hamilton i think it is a fantastic musical i think it is brilliant however that being said i hate the fact that it has become a political vehicle for the progressive agenda and we're going to talk about that today but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification bell and of course you can check out my merch collection at dailywire.com brett you're gonna have to bear with me because we're gonna watch a video together i've only seen the first part of it because i started cringing so hard and i really want you guys to have my honest reaction the cast of hamilton is back with yet another political stunt but they have been doing this since the show debuted in 2015 we have watched hamilton insert themselves in everything from trump's election to the 2020 elections to covet literally everything and they are not stopping now because apparently if you happen to create smart about a historical event or american history you suddenly become the authority on current american politics oh god dude oh no no i'm so sorry i am not sitting around waiting to hear what the ensemble of hamilton is going to tell me about the upcoming midterm elections but you know what today we are doing just that so without further ado let's cringe together our big mission make sure everyone knows that voting is essential it's what we need to make this country reach its full potential the biggest impact you can have is through your choice because you should know that your vote is your voice but it's not easy voter suppression is making registration tricky in certain states the rules about voter id are picky no matter where you live or even if you voted last time the rules and regulations can get sticky but now we're here to help cause we know you love our show friends we can help you but we'll tell you everything we know let's get educated why did you need to stop real quick these are ensemble and swing cast members of hamilton saying we are going to educate you i don't mean to be offensive but i guarantee they went to syracuse university and got a musical theater degree you should not trust them with any kind of political theory or advice they say that they're just trying to get people to vote but then they say things like your choice matters we're going to tell you everything we know that means they're going to indoctrinate you with probably very very terrible ideas from their musical theater program like news flash guys not every single piece of art corporation institution organization needs to be talking about politics all the time sometimes we just want to enjoy what you've created and move on with our lives i don't want to be thinking about politics when i'm putting on my skin care which is why i love me skincare because while i'm using all the products in my daily glow-up routine i'm not thinking about how this corporation hates me i'm just thinking about how amazing the products are because nimmy skincare simply wants to provide you with an effective 100 american-made product and to represent good universal values nothing more nothing less and that is how it should be if you want to check them out go to nimmyskincare.com and use promo code cooper at checkout for 15 off your order again that is nimmyskincare.com promo code cooper but now back to the miserable people that literally cannot spare us a single moment from pushing their progressive agenda down our throats just visit him for progress we'll get you everything you need to know it's a website [Music] now every state will have specific voter id laws voter suppression makes it harder to support your cause minorities the elderly disabled and the poor are most affected when the laws require something more so vote writers writers.org will tell you what those laws entail you'll also see how you can vote early or through the mail and don't forget down ballot races are important too we'll get you all the information you'll know what to do like i actually love the real version of the song i hate this the pledge to vote that would be great the future is in your hands just you wait i have chills and not the good kind of chills the chills that make me think that i'm getting nauseous and want to throw up but also probably chills from the fact that i genuinely love that song and these people have ruined it a bunchy can at least carry i want to know what would it be like being a more conservative right of center just a person with common sense having to be in that broadway show with those people hey guys let's all get together and do do a video about progressive voting in the midterm elections what do you do if you say oh no i'm not really into that i don't you know do your own thing i don't really support that they're all gonna turn on you like freaking hyenas that's what the artist community is like i can't imagine that's just terrible the comments on this video thankfully not a lot of people have seen it because it is so cringe like this guy says now i want to vote and i don't even live in the u.s so great another person says this song alone is enough to make me want to vote even at 14. there's so many comments like that i'm like guys get a break they're not going to notice you this person also has problems uh they said i've got a passion to defeat fascism it's why i strive to keep this drive to keep the dream alive because i'm not throwing away my vote i'm a really good rapper guys hamilton should cast me just saying thankfully underneath all of that mess there were a few people that had some kind of common sense and were unafraid to fight back against the people who are kissing hamilton's ass in the comments i'm a minority in tbh it's a little offensive that people think we are not capable of getting an id revolutionary idea all of my friends and relatives have ids because how else would we do so many things that ids require like driving to work or putting money in the bank or writing a check or buying a home exactly you can't even get on a plane if you do not have an id it is truly mind-boggling to me that we are still having this fake debate about whether or not voter id suppresses minorities and whether minorities and poor people and disabled people can get id's no i think that they can if you are a citizen of this country you are able to get an id very quickly i hate the dmv more than most people for many reasons but you know what i still go and i still get my license my passport all of that stuff it's not that hard somebody else said i can't wait to vote for the republicans there you go thank you very much we were voting for common sense this november i wish hamilton wasn't so slanted bro it's obnoxious yes this is one of those things where they are making it impossible to separate the art from the artists i would love to be able to you know watch the recorded version of hamilton and listen to the music and just appreciate it for the brilliant piece of art that it is because it truly is an amazing piece of art in an amazing broadway show but these people make the entire production insufferable like you are shooting yourself in the foot but i honestly don't think that they care because so many of these artists are incredibly entitled and they don't think that anybody who has opinions that differ than theirs or have different values should be allowed to view their art or be privy to it that's why you know you see people like bette midler and bernadette peters get up on stage and go get out of my theater like they will stop the show they're all obnoxious they're all entitled obviously not every single broadway performer but a lot of them are you are terrible i wanted to pluck out my eyes and jam them into my ears i wanted to pummel you with a manhole cover but interestingly enough this is not the only political rap that has been going around the internet this week and this one some people might find it very cringy but because it is on my side of the political aisle i actually think it's quite entertaining but even if it was a left-wing political ad i would still semi-find it endearing let's just watch i think you all know what i'm talking about hey utah district 12 listen up right here there's a new name on the ballot for the senate this year my name is linda paulsen republican and awesome love god and family and the constitution i tried to get another conservative to run nobody could do it so i'm getting it done i'm pro religious freedom pro-life pro-police the right to bear arms and the right to free speech i want less government control and regulation want to stop and expose all political corruption where's integrity morality accountability government programs should lead to self-sufficiency and support traditional family as the fundamental unit of society but in schools they are pushing for new beliefs and just to clarify that as a female adult i know what a woman is i understood that reference well that was certainly a that was certainly a trip i can't wait to see her at the grammy awards next year sometimes people ask me what can we do to win the culture war it's not that there is a reason conservatives have been so behind for so many years and it is because of people like this and obviously i would vote for linda that ad would make me get up and you know go vote for her i think she's great i love the fact that she said she was trying to get somebody else to run nobody would so she is stepping up to the plate that's amazing you go you protect your community you make some change i am here for it but my god people be brave be creative be willing to take risks obviously she is but i mean young people get out there and get involved because if this is the best that we have we are doomed linda was the entirety of stephen colbert's opening monologue on the late show last night literally all he did for six minutes was just talk about this video make fun of her say like oh what is a woman oh look at your stupid rap and i feel bad because obviously she is genuinely trying to make change in her community but we have to step up but thankfully the comments did warm my heart because so many people were just happy to see a little old woman having fun her granddaughter played hamilton in the car once and she said i can do that another person said nothing screams i'm in touch with things like an aarp rapper eminem has been awfully quiet since this dropped and somebody else said i would make this my ringtone i saw a couple of other comments on twitter of people saying like she just looks like a sweet grandma like let her live and i mean that's sort of my opinion but on a broader scale we have to have better content than that i hope that my content is at least somewhat less cringy than that video but to wrap it all up to really bring this episode full circle and kind of tie a bow on it i have a collab from six years ago it's utah politicians because linda is from utah utah politicians doing hamilton karaoke i don't like where this is going the gist of this video the backstory is that the utah government wanted to show that they had camaraderie across party lines and so they have a few democrats and a couple republicans in the car and they're all interacting and singing hamilton it is as cringe as you think make no mistake we disagree on plenty of things but we're friends plenty plenty you know how they do the cabinet battle i think that's how we need to settle uh any disagreements so why don't we try a real casual i think in the future the best rapping is who wins we're gonna wrap up we'll cabinet battle this let's go let's do it life liberty and the pursuit of happiness we fought for these ideals we shouldn't settle the list these are wise words enterprising men code them this video is nine minutes long they go pick up other politicians i'm not kidding turn out some music where are ya [Music] i'm watching this i don't know how a single democrat likes this show because they don't give out anything for free you get no freebies wow sick burn bruh i just really want to know if they all felt ridiculous while they were doing this when they were setting up their little gopros i should be nice because i do appreciate that they are you know being friendly and we have some unity and some good old american fun and you know we're missing that so maybe maybe this is just an old relic of the past that we should appreciate i really never want to see this kind of thing ever again but maybe we can find a different way to show camaraderie hey hey i can't believe that you're about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "XP6gIawb2n0": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper guys by now we all know that disney is corrupt and they're in for a hell of a year they got their special tax law revoked by desantis their not so secret gay agenda got exposed they're about to lose the mickey mouse trademark this year all of their sexual you know predator employees are being exposed they're kind of digging their own grave while simultaneously trying to climb out of it and every day they get exposed for something new but before we dive into today's scandal make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already i think we are going to hit 700 000 today we might have already hit it by the time this video comes out so whoo yay thank you so much we did a backstage live at the ryman theater in nashville on wednesday night and it was so much fun having a lot of you guys there the energy was incredible uh it was so fun walking on stage and being able to see some of you guys uh so if you were there thank you so much and if you are just finding this show welcome we are happy to have you but let's get back to the content you guys all know big hero 6 the main character from that kind of looking like the michelin tire man is it michelin marshmallow or is it michelin tire michelin tire who's the marshmallow man stay puft so he's a combination of the michelin man and the stay puft marshmallow man that main character well they're making a new tv show for disney plus it is called bay back buy back baymax and chris rufo who is the one who exposed uh those videos from the disney execs meeting with the not so secret gay agenda all that stuff he pulled a clip from the unreleased tv show that has the internet going crazy let's take a let's take a little peruse at this [Music] excuse me which of these products would you recommend oh um well these are the tampons i usually use thank you i prefer pads they're more comfortable for me thank you i always get the ones with wings thank you get unscented and bleach free if you can thank yo my daughter loves these and keys might be easier if it's our first period these are really environmentally friendly y'all in this one scene disney has hit every intersectional box we're talking about periods we got women's rights issues we it's environmentally friendly we have a trans man and then of course we have rights for non-humans because there are so many people that now identify as inanimate objects so we have big hero 6 guy here disney you are the most progressive i understand you were wanting the brownie points you want the accolades so let's just all give a moment let's give them some applause they really in that one scene they checked all the boxes you stink there were some people that were kind of weirded out about you know talking about tampons periods i i don't want period stuff shoved down my throat like there was a company that i saw recently that is making uterus period cereal in order to encourage talks about menstruation at the breakfast table i am not you that's literally something that takes it a bit too far but you know what women have periods it's normal thing i that doesn't bother me but it is so blatant that they are you know trying to please people that they are trying to be as woke as possible so that nobody gets mad at them and i i can't even look at this and appreciate a normal scene without going okay come on you're just trying to appease people so if it wasn't you know this political climate i probably wouldn't be bothered by this whole tampon scene but people were mostly concerned with the trans man with the trans flag t-shirt buying tampons chalkboard review posted no one not one person not a single individual disney tampons and transgender periods and then they posted this meme kids tampons disney with the trans flag oh god yeah somebody said shout out to all my men who menstruate this guy says is that a linebacker sharing his favorite tampon brand listen in this climate maybe you know there was a whole ordeal recently because tampax the tampon company started advertising with trans women trans women meaning biological men you guys know that tick tock or dylan the 100 days of girl hood that guy sponsored by tampax what do you need tampons for you don't have a uterus well she's a guy so we have de-stigmatized periods too much it should be more taboo i don't want it in my woke tv shows but you know something that should actually be destigmatized having a fire skincare routine i am so tired of people going oh my gosh you have like a four step skincare yes i do because i use nimmy skincare's daily glow up routine i am absolutely going to do all of my steps every morning and night and you guys should too because nimmy skincare is the only skin care brand that is against all of this woke bs that is against cancer culture and that actually has american values and they are american made and source many of their ingredients from local farms what is not to love so to check them out and get your own skincare routine go to nimmyskincare.com and use promo code cooper at checkout for 15 off your entire order i promise you guys are gonna love it and there are no trans flags on any of their branding there were a lot of people who were defending it if you go to the quote tweets there were a lot of people who were really excited about the scene somebody said this is a garbage tape but this clip is so great i wish i had something like this as a kid because i was so scared and ashamed of getting periods especially having something comforting is having a trans character unashamedly buying tampons the first part of it i do get because there are a lot of young women who are nervous you know about puberty and about that part of life and that's understandable because it's new and it's you know your body is changing all of that but again why the need to shove the trans agenda into that scene it would have been just fine if it was just you know michelin stay puft man you know trying to figure out what tampons to buy somebody but of course that is the world we live in where art entertainment is rarely authentic and creative and without political agendas uh you guys know sesame street obviously even i who was raised without television knows sesame street well they have gotten themselves into a little bit of a internet pickle because elmo just got his pfizer vaccine i looked it up elmo's apparently three years old and he went and got his vaccine with his little elmo dad but i was on twitter last night as i usually am and this headline it just cracked me up senator ted cruz is feuding with another sesame street muppet over vaccines the popular children's show shared a clip of elmo receiving his coven 19 vaccine on tuesday causing the texas senator to speak out against the beloved character's parent oh my god he's obviously talking about the institution the people behind sesame street you idiots what an idiot all right let's actually watch the clip now now daddy has super duper bandages just like elmo you were super duper today getting your covert vaccine elmo there was a little pinch but it was okay emma was really glad to have daddy and baby david there with him baby david where are you i had a lot of questions about elmo getting the covert vaccine was it safe was it the right decision i talked to our pediatrician so i could make the right choice i learned that elmo getting vaccinated is the best way to keep himself our friends neighbors and everyone else healthy and enjoying the things they love it's okay to have questions about coveted vaccines for your kids well at least this wasn't part of a normal episode because watching that imagine if you were a kid just watching sesame street and suddenly elmo's dad was there talking about safety concerns about vaccines it is literally a big pharma infomercial i don't care if you want to get the vaccine or not or if you you know do whatever that is your life go for it but it's just weird again how all of these political agendas and i am saying that the vaccine is political because it has been turned political all of this is infiltrating every single aspect of entertainment there is very little that is actually creative and that is character driven and that is devoid of some alternate agenda i was about to say some like covert agenda but it's not even covert it is so blatant they're slapping trans flags everywhere suddenly elmo's getting governed vaccinated the not-so-secret gay agenda they are not even hiding it you know i mentioned earlier in this episode that we had backstage live at the ryman on wednesday night and one of the greatest things that we premiered was an exclusive look at our first animated children's show called chipchilla and the audience went crazy rightfully so because these parents and these families these grandparents are seeing what is going on their children's screens what is going on in their schools we need content that is just for kids that is safe for kids that is devoid of all of this and one of the great things about daily wire plus and about the content that we are putting out is that it is not overtly right wing or conservative literally the goal is just providing good quality content that is actually child friendly that actually teaches good values that can be applicable to anybody and the fact that that is revolutionary or even controversial is mind-boggling to me but then i look at these clips from disney and sesame street and all of that it's like yeah okay it is definitely needed tina says headlines in one month elmo died in his sleep due to sudden muppet death syndrome no comment somebody said elmo still got covered and elmo was having heart issues and then somebody said when will elma wear a strap on and show his support for pride next damn as has been she done anything for pride let's google let's go on an adventure sesame street pride okay yes they did the first thing love makes a family pride month my favorite uncle who does my hair my auntie and tv make me cheer my neighbor jessie there even more that's a bearded lady i am the bearded lady but are you one of the freaks okay i was like semi-fine with the other stuff a bearded woman that i don't love that i don't think a three-year-old needs to be like mommy why does why does the lady have a beard both my mom that every soccer game driving with my papas i want my sibling they take me for ice cream all right there we go sibling they take me for ice cream non-binary check there see there's moments in this that i think okay this is very pure this is very cute i like the values in this song love makes a family i can cheer that on but again like i said with the disney stuff earlier it is so blatant it's like taking a pan let me hit you over the head with the wokeness [Music] the comments are turned off what do you know i'm not even surprised i mean all of the pride stuff all of it whenever a company or a show does it now it's just kind of you know okay well there's another one checking it off the most important thing here is that no matter what side of the political aisle you are on it is vitally important that you are involved in what your kids are consuming and watching not just again from a political agenda standpoint but the values i mean think about disney channel all of those kids were utter brats their parents had no boundaries the parents were usually off doing whatever the kids were awful to each other they were overdramatic and i truly think that they have corrupted my generation just watching that show and that wasn't political at all so just be aware know what your kids are watching and then when daily wire comes out with stuff for your kids just watch that instead because i promise it'll be good hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "pHnKes1RSCc": "you know that hassan [\u00a0__\u00a0] i'm coming to kill you in los angeles at your house or in the ring no in real life i'm going to stalk him and become obsessed with him and wear his makeup and his dresses and he was asking as a coach like the ancient irish did let them fight welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper we have some social media beef for you today and as you all know

will be entered into the giveaway i think it'll be tons of fun and i hope you all join but now back to the real social media beef of the hour now before we get into this i just need to give a little perspective about who these people are who the characters are in this narrative number one hassan [\u00a0__\u00a0] i'm an idiot i'm a dumb uh bimbo i don't know what i'm talking about we all know him i think the video on my channel with the most views is my response to him because early on in my channel he made a video about me so you can go watch that if you want to get some context about him he is the golden child of the young turks literally he is chanker's nephew and that's how he got to start and he is now a huge leftist twitch streamer i think probably the biggest on the platform has tons of influence very very popular he's kind of crazy i don't agree with him on basically anything but i sort of appreciate his chaos from time to time it's entertaining and then the other character in this whole narrative is sam hyde sam hyde is a right-wing comedian who got cancelled years ago when he had his own show on adult swim he now does his own stuff on youtube he's super wild but very funny and these days he's more of like a prankster and just kind of creates a stir on the internet rather than doing like serious political commentary so he's not really in the political arena but everybody knows him as being like pretty far right those are your characters now to set the stage i really feel like i'm in like a drama department and i'm your theater teacher here as many of you probably know many youtube celebrities and rappers like to fight each other i really don't know what better way to put it but you know like logan paul and jake paul they're all boxing now and then ksi is probably the biggest guy and he fights everybody anyway a bunch of fights are happening at the o2 arena in london right now and sam hyde has in the past couple of years gotten into this youtube internet fighting world he was in a fight a couple of nights ago and uh said this afterwards you got anyone you want to call out in the heavyweight division oh you know it's lad you know that hassan [\u00a0__\u00a0] i'm coming to kill you in los angeles at your house so uh that was it he had just fought this man is literally batshit crazy dripping in sweat saying that he wants to go fight and kill hassan [\u00a0__\u00a0] now this is the first time that i had heard of any part of this social media beef but apparently this is not the first time that he has asked to fight hassan this is back in march at hassan the hun you're a human being and i want to see you not be like a trampled on shadow person for your own sake learn to fight you need to loosen up and figure out how to punch and move fluidly get a good coach and start now i'm going to force this situation on you and apparently he only got into this youtube fighting world so that he could fight hassan and he said that if hassan turns him down this time he's just going to stop all together because he's training and he's fighting but really the only person he wants to fight is hassan and if i'm getting that wrong you guys can address it in the comments but as somebody who has not followed this all the time that's sort of what i've been able to piece together from all the different tweets and like clips from streams and the reason why you might be asking which is what i was asking as well he just hates hassan and here are some quotes from a recent daily mirror article that kind of illustrate that i just hate him he continued his politics are a dime a dozen i don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about his politics i hate him i want to kill him it is literally because he wears a puka shell necklace it's just when you lock eyes with somebody and you know genetically that you are programmed to be their enemy do you ever just see people with deep set alligator eyes you know that they're criminal i know that you're a criminal because your eyes are deep in your head i know you're going to commit a crime there's just some people where you go i'm your genetic enemy somehow we are destined to do battle and that is what i see when i see hassan [\u00a0__\u00a0] i'm just imagining him doing that in the whole irish accent like screaming at this reporter as he's giving that comment and you know what to be fair i am even guilty of this sometimes like there will be a nice person they have done nothing to me and i just look at them and i go you bother me like we all have those people and it's just some people just irk us but this man apparently has a deep deep problems with us on and you know to hassan's credit if i had somebody saying all of this stuff about me my security would be alerted and i really would not be that inclined to respond but i don't know about hassan he's like very abrasive he's a huge muscular dude who could probably beat somebody up and he said some pretty wild [\u00a0__\u00a0] so it would not be out of the ordinary for him to respond or fight this guy so it is surprising to many that hassan has not made any big public comments about the whole thing until now sort of the day that this fight happened he posted this and then deleted it on his private twitter account and he said big day for the 36 year old mentally ill nazi still trying to relive the halcyon days of 4chan now as you all know i was not a 4chan girl don't exactly know what this means but a lot of people were screenshotting it and going okay hassan's losing it he's a bit unhinged what the hell is going on and then he deleted it which makes a statement in itself he also said this on his stream which pissed people off if you see a mentally ill nazi okay on the internet be like i'm gonna kill hassan [\u00a0__\u00a0] okay i'm gonna come to his house and murder him and you go oh this is some information that he should probably walk like he should he should watch and address this then honestly just don't post and get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of the community it just be normal dude so that's basically all he said so he's insinuating that he doesn't want to talk about it and he's apparently banning people who mention sam hyde or any of sam's nicknames he's still calling him a nazi but he's putting it out there that he doesn't want to address it he doesn't want to talk about it by somewhat addressing it so it's a tad bit of an oxymoron and a brief observation there is a lot of throwing the word nazi around here i don't think sam hyde is a nazi that's just hassan doing normal leftist stuff where if there's anybody that they don't like they call them a nazi or a homophobe or a racist or a misogynist or whatever you want to call it you keep using the horde i don't think it means what you think it means sam hyatt has also been called alt-right and ultra maggot and all of that stuff so it kind of adds up all of those slurs in a way it seems like hassan doesn't want to touch this and won't be fighting sam which a ton of people are pissed off about and so he has been trending and people have been calling him a [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that video that i just showed you had so many quote tweets of people just going what a [\u00a0__\u00a0] i hate you like man up all of this stuff so he's dealing with some crap right now somebody said apparently hassan [\u00a0__\u00a0] has banned hyde and candyman from his chat people are getting hour-long time-outs oh god this one sorry about this hassan biker said america deserved 911 and he's crying about sam hyde threatening him lmfao and yes he did say that uh like i said he can be a tad bit of a loose cannon when he did his video about me and he said like she doesn't even like really stream like she like does these episodes and they're edited he was like she won't even get a chance to have her like 9 11 was warranted moment and i was like well kind of glad but also i don't even think that would be a problem because i don't believe that but anyway that's who hassan is in a way america deserve 911 dude [\u00a0__\u00a0] it i'm saying somebody else uh posted this overlay of sam hyde on top of a son and said tiktakasana uh i will say sam hyde like that's something that nightmares are made of like if i was a son i would be taking extra precautions uh another person said i firmly believe that hassan deserves to live in fear actually there were a lot of comments like that of people who hate him that's one thing with him people hate him on all sides of the political aisle it's kind of something to be respected in a way not really like i appreciate the fact that i have people from all sides of the political aisle that come here and like my content and we can all you know be friends and find common ground with him it's like people violently hate him on all sides of it which is just a trip another person said i would love to watch this [\u00a0__\u00a0] but we all know hassan is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] and there's sam hyden hassan somebody quote tweeted a picture of a son working out and said you'll post pictures pretending you're training for something but you won't fight sam hyde for charity illiol that's the other thing with all these youtube fights all of the money goes to charity and they can donate it and that sort of thing nuance bro tweeted out and said let me get this straight if i'm not mistaken hassan the hun supports punching nazis he calls samhai to nazi yet refuses to get paid millions of dollars to punch said nazi literally like if you can't take it then don't dish it out in the first place hassan has literally become known as hassan punch a nazi [\u00a0__\u00a0] it's like his tagline he says it all the time but all these like ultra mega right wing whatever i'll go punch a nazi whatever like he has the chance to punch a guy that he thinks that he claims is a nazi and he's not taking it why are you running why are you running so either he's afraid of the fight or he doesn't actually believe that sam hides the nazi and either way there's a lot of inconsistency here to unpack somebody said sam hyde really is formed the perfect response of political influencers that target children as their demo no comment especially on the left just saying zamide threatening us on rules because sam is a freak and likely just been having sex with a barbell weight while doing a chinese accent voice since that appearance like literally in my mind this could just be a pr stunt the guy is a prankster he is a chaos demon does he actually want to fight hassan maybe i have no idea i don't spend my time watching either of these people but i am enjoying it watching it unfold and therefore would i like to see this fight happen absolutely it would be highly entertaining one guy would be in a freaking costume with a mask and an irish accent and the other guy would have a pooka shell necklace on with black painted fingernails it would be hysterical but do i like either of them no not really so i don't really care that much i mean have you seen the way that hassan fiker kicks like look at that there is no power behind it at all and sam hyde is basically a tubby roly-poly it would be chaos and to be quite honest i would pay to see it but do i like either of them am i invested in either of them not really so i don't actually care that much i mean this is kind of a perfect example of the horseshoe idea where the two political sides will get so extreme that they will just find each other and they'll come back like hassan [\u00a0__\u00a0] and sam hyde somehow are meeting back in the middle with the same amount of chaos the same amount of energy and vitriol towards each other maybe this is the moment of synergy and harmony that this country has needed like i don't know maybe the two extremes will finally duke it out and we won't need a civil war after all because i don't know if you guys saw that poll but apparently like 49 of americans think that one is coming so maybe we can just have these guys fight and we can avoid the whole thing do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "9_hZdXVrahA": "i have been put in the position to dead name and misgender students for the last few months or whatever since i started working at my current school corporation and today was the day that i resigned i was called in and they said they had a meeting with the superintendent or assistant superintendent and the school lawyer and that um while they are here while students are with us we are acting in loco parento which apparently means that we are acting in place of the parents and so therefore we have to abide by parent wishes because of this i have resigned i will not be put in a position to feel like i'm going against my own community and i will not feed into misgendering i love this comment somebody said my wife is a teacher and this is actually her solution to the entire issue every time a student says pronoun stuff she just asks what their parents call them easy day your ten-year-old's political stance is no longer her problem she just does what the parents wants like why why is that controversial", "_m3xVkbaAkc": "[Music] welcome back to off the clock i'm brett cooper and guys this is rocky we made it rocky is on the show she is here guest starring in this special episode she is a crusty white dog [Music] my producer finally met her today very begrudgingly there's a video of that on my youtube story if you are interested where he was forced to hold her it was absolutely delightful [Laughter] and he really embodies the entire internet's hatred of krusty white dogs so today because we have rocky on the show i thought i would go through some of these comments about krusty white dogs the tick tocks that are made about her kind and fight back against all of them with her cuteness okay that's my armpit um rocky is three years old i got her from a friend whose family accidentally had puppies she's named after rocky balboa and she is a poodle terrier mix so she is just a rat and that's all the background you need to know she also just farted on my lap probably out of fear it's fear farts oh my god oh holy it's not so bad rocky sucks listen she's very cute she's scared this is a lot of attention i'm nervous right now listen it doesn't even faze me we're going to get into the video now are you getting comfortable rocky we're just going to stay here thank you all right so first of all there was a whole article about the crusty white dog trend online and it goes everyone's making fun of those little crusty-eyed white dogs every rich family had growing up i didn't know that it was just a specific class of people i was in la and i feel like every single person has a crusty white purse dog it's either this or it's a chihuahua so i really didn't know any different and it really isn't class-based in la it's literally every single family but i mean i guess it is la so it makes sense but they go they start the article by going for the most part dogs are cute uh but there are some that are just objectively the [\u00a0__\u00a0] worst um and then they say at the top of this list are chihuahuas who try to be yappy aggressive and demon spawn but coming in second our breed not often spoken about despite everyone knowing the exact dog by description alone when i say those fluffy white dogs the crusty eyes you know the exact dog i'm thinking of right the dogs are the crispy eye red stains or the goopy black stuff around their eye area literally this is just a hit piece about this kind of dog and i'm not gonna have it so the crustiness it is normal for them and often it has to do with diet and some dogs have more crust than others and you can get you can give them little vitamins and pills to stop it or you can get like like tear stained stuff but rocky i will say does have additional crust because she has a beard even though she is a woman maybe she's trans actually maybe she's a bearded lady um because she has her fancy raw meat diet this small dog devours raw meat every morning so that's just pure blood on her mouth even though i washed her literally last night i'm not really giving a good thesis for why my dog is still cute but i love her anyway so i really don't care what the internet has to say but the internet did have to say some horrifying things this lady says we're running out of time for lucy to pick her ugly krusty white dog i need her teen friends to be like oh what is that and she has to say oh that's princess tinkerbell i picked out when i was seven she bites but has no teeth i got rocky not as a six year old i got her as a sophomore in college when i was having a mental breakdown during final season and i thought it was a great idea to adopt a second dog but i do have a crusty white dog that i have had since i was 10 his name is vinnie he is 15 years old no it wasn't since i was 10 then well he we got him when he was like eight or something like that i don't know he was older four or five i have no concept of time but he's like 14 or 15 now lives with my mom she also has a second crusty white dog his name is banks we've had him since i was about 13. so those are my like long-standing crusty white dogs i have three of them i'm so sorry somebody said is having a crusty white dog a red flag yes or no it's a green flag somebody said this guy thought the appropriate way to slide into my dms was by asking me why all cute girls have a crusty white dog anger anger anger imma find out where he lives and have ollie's [\u00a0__\u00a0] on his bed um so all his name was my other dog hello unlike amber heard rocky has never [\u00a0__\u00a0] the bed somebody said there will always be a crusty white dog being a little [\u00a0__\u00a0] rocky's not a little bit she's a princess thank you very much somebody said she's a 10 but she has a crusty white dog again this is a green flag then she's a 15. thank you very much but he said just watched a guy at starbucks very lovingly removed the eye gunk from his crusty little white dog he then kissed the crusty little white dog's head and got him a puppuccino people are good i think hello i don't you don't see a lot of guys with little white dogs i'm just saying it is more of a female thing unless it's like a middle-aged man who like somehow got the crusty white dog in the divorce or he's walking his rich wife's crusty white dog kind of situation you don't see a lot of younger guys hello with crusty white dogs i aim to change that so young men out there i'm not trying to feminize you but i do want you to try some moisturizer and i do want you to get over the issues that you have with these angelic angelic dogs producer sheller might hate her but producer kobe over here met her for the first time and thought that she was an angel even though she's having an exorcism on my lap right now um this last one this person said no wonder she's got no self-respect she has a crusty white dog i have so much self-respect i have so much self-respect that i don't care if you don't like my crusty white dog even though i'm doing an entire video defending her um calculating the y equals mx plus b of requesting white dog dear god someone just posted a picture of theirs and said i love you so much crusty ass white dog that's not the most flattering photo but i will say i am guilty of the fact that i will post an ugly ass photo of rocky like she has not been bathed in a week she's rolled in some dirt and she makes a cute face i'm like oh my god she's literally a precious angel and i have to post her and i have a bunch of guys in my dms being like i draw the line here lady i draw the line here this is a big trend on tick-tock talking about crusty white dogs obviously so here we go hey hey rocky's cuter than that though isn't she then what than that dog that you just saw in the video oh i didn't see it you were talking about rocky yes yes blasphemy i thought you were talking about the ugly ass one in the video that one needed help i need like a camera on you in this video the attacks that my child is getting um this one's not wrong though if a guy shows up to my house he's being faced with a tiny little white dog that is very protective and a very very old lab that has a deep bark but will not do anything because he moves at the pace of a snail so really because ollie who's my big dog is about 14 now this is my mode of protection let's see oh god when you see your girlfriend's crusty little white dog laying in the driveway oh my god he's backing up that's literally sheller that is literally sheller he would run over a crusty white dog and think that he was doing a good thing for society [Music] the only one with courage so innocent sheller you've never allowed over at my house ever i know you're is so mean what he else said when your parents say you can't get a new dog until your 15 year old krusty white dog dies oh no this is another shallow one oh they're drop kicking it there's so much slander don't drop kick your old krusty white dogs they have so much curly-haired love to give so much lots of pants lots of kisses so many years of mats and stinks but you love them regardless um there's one account that has so many followers this is literally what rocky looked like last night when i gave her a bath can you calm down you're like hyperventilating small white curly haired dogs are crusty as [\u00a0__\u00a0] they always have basic names like fluffy or coco little white dogs are immortal they can live for up to 60 years their breath smells like ass and they always want to fight dogs five times their size i literally don't even have a problem with that it's so cute this is how she looked last night i put her in the kitchen sink and she gets so skinny and all of her hair goes down and she's like mom what are you doing to me oh god you just gave me the killer is escaping [Applause] i'm not gonna lie they're so ugly when they're wet she looks like a deformed rat when she's wet i'm sorry if i scare you wait what is happening here watch me die my watch me dye my dog brown so nobody calls her a crusty white dog anymore i'm going to do this and see if sheller likes her better dog brown so nobody calls her a crusty white dog anymore wash and dyeing process me thinking how to tell my mexican mom this mother effort is a ginger now she's ugly now yeah she might be ugly but now she's not a crusty white dog but you know there are it's not ginger there are apricot apricot however you want to pronounce it poodles and i objectively think that the white crusties are cuter just saying that's a hot take i really don't have much to say for the internet other than i don't care about your opinions of my dog because i love her and i hope that her sitting here um sniffing my armpit and trying to sit still has convinced you to you know maybe think twice before you make fun of the krusty white dogs guys if you go to a girl's house and you see that she has a crusty white dog that's not a red flag it's not maybe she's a wonderful person and maybe the dog is sweeter than you think maybe it's not yappy if it's a chihuahua that's a different that's a different situation and i i will let you move on at your own discretion before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribed to this channel and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and i don't want you to miss a thing", "P95OEwMEWDU": "i'm having the meat sweats [Music] well we meet again but this time it is under very different circumstances i am back with another episode of off the clock and obviously i have a collection of things in front of me 10 different groupings that are making this entire studio and the entire production building smell like a fast food food court mall food court whatever you want to call it a stomachache on a table so on my team we do a lot of polls everyone is very opinionated which i appreciate we do a lot of rankings and i thought why not as the leader of this entire operation i think i should be the one to have the definitive ranking at the end of all of this so i asked my team to send me their very favorite fast food restaurants i have had them all ordered here and i am going to try each and every one of these and give you my definitive fast food ranking obviously these are ones that we can just get in nashville so things like in and out and whataburger even though there is whataburger here just kind of far away from where we are um are not included but we do have like a local staple like hattie bees um to prepare myself for this endeavor i have only had water for like the last six hours um in case things get really gross i have some ketchup to add flavor i have my ranking cards which is gonna be great i have a bag next to me in case i need to hurl and most importantly i have my water and i have a ginger ale in case i start feeling ill i actually don't know if the whole like drink ginger ale when your stomach hurts is a real thing i'm gonna choose in this moment to believe that it is i'm going to leave these right here in front of me i'm going to move this direction so first we have popeyes popeyes and popeye's fries which i'm actually very excited oh my god i can't even pick them up because i do really love popeyes when the popeyes spicy chicken sandwich came out they were like lines out of popeyes i remember being in burbank california sheller and i were talking about the popeyes it was in burbank and it was literally sold out and then during kovid that became a place where i would go all the time and you had to like stand outside while you waited for your food and all the tables were closed it was like a bunch of crap but you know what it was worth it it was worth it for this sandwich see if it still levels up here in nashville [Music] that's good that's good it is still spicy i don't know if i talked about this i don't do great with heat but i do like the sandwich see it's solid this one was a bit breadier and this piece of chicken is just an amp you know but it's solid there's a reason why people are so excited about it a lot of people were saying it was better than chick-fil-a which i don't really know because chick-fil-a is just such a classic but i will say at the height of this i was getting this a lot more than chick-fil-a and i had a chick-fil-a in the vicinity sheldon was making a joke saying that like this is where our careers are at like you said that like with a bad tone i'm saying this with a positive tone because growing up middle and high school years i would watch the videos of people doing these tier rankers people would like i would see youtubers like emma chamberlain and the dolan twins oh their fries are so good and they would be like in the back of their car at 3am like in and out mukbang and i'd be like i want to do that now i am i've made it sheller okay well seasoning good a tad soggy but i still like the sandwich so we're gonna put this back sadly the popeye fries at this location not as crispy as i want it's gonna bring their score down a bit i'm already feeling it we're gonna move on to five guys i love their fries we just take a look at this seasoning bobby can you see the seasoning here just the crusting on the foil divine i love burgers okay okay i should do it this way it looks better [Music] i'm really enjoying for the viewers shallow with his headphones on every time i take a bite closer to microphone okay five guys is so solid it's like a fantastic burger and i think a lot of people sleep on it for some reason but you know in and out is a cult classic burger place and i do like it i think the fries are fantastic but arguably five guys is so much better and i'm not afraid to say it i'm not mad i'm not mad okay so this is solid i'm happy with it i oh although i wish that there was a little more of a kick or something i know i said that after i just said i don't really do all spicy things but it's a very plain burger i don't really think that they do a lot of seasoning in the patty so it really relies on the toppings a lot but again how much can you expect from fast food but now this one is a very special man on my team his name is carter he actually has a viral tweet uh with almost a million likes huge huge deal around here uh he had it prepped for when the amber her johnny depp trial came out i'll have it popped up here but that's carter and uh he's been talking about fazoli's fazzoli's he's here right now because he was so excited about me trying these breadsticks i had no idea that there was a drive-through italian restaurant now i know that's good i want you all to see this look at the butter seeping through this bag we have fast food pasta you can't really up pasta can you oh no okay hold on it's like seeping out of the container this is going to make me never want to have fast food again which is probably good for my overall health okay all right so we have two things here we have spaghetti with meatballs ooh it's like taking on a mold it's like not mold but like it's like formed into a shape oh wait no it's lasagna how many things oh my god carter what is this there's lasagna it's a trio this might be the most american thing i've ever seen and it's not even american food it is this is american food so we have lasagna let's try a bite of that one first [Music] i'm not a fan of the sauce but i like the cheese i like the texture sauce is a bit okay we have a we have a spaghetti i'm actually not gonna eat the rest of this this you're gonna have this carter do you want my leftovers god he's like i'm like leonard carter was like i want to be the first one to get the okay here we go i feel so odd this is a big meatball [Music] that's definitely maybe not real meat but the flavor was there the flavor was there with the meatball i'm okay with it now this fettuccine alfredo i'm not gonna lie i'm a tad worried it's like it's literally taking on a shape this is like a spaghetti statue this is for you oh oh actually that's not terrible i like that i do like that okay this is not all from fazuli's though [Laughter] because somebody wanted me to have more i'm already not feeling great the breadsticks are better like this is okay but this is just like barely any cheese the bread sticks and then kind of very very mediocre probably also fake pepperoni on top of it so if you're going to go to fazzulli's just get the breadsticks am i saying it wrong is that why you're laughing at me fazzulli's fazzoli's where was i with this oh i just wan but the um this was interesting the fettuccine alfredo was definitely a standout as well as the breadsticks i've never really been an olive garden person but i do know that everybody likes their breadsticks these might be better we're going to move on to something i'm very worried about i'm going to skip at hattie bees for now because i want to get through the pain first white castle what is this this unseasoned nothing oh oh that's bad i can already tell that's going to be like at the bottom honestly wait till you get to the slider should i put ketchup on this you might want to the fact that oh what have you done who nobody nobody actually likes this right i understand if this is a cheap option and it's near you and it's like i need something and it's affordable but y'all mcdonald's is better and for five dollars you can get a four piece chicken nuggets fake meat and a vanilla iced coffee should i put ketchup on this i probably should you should welcome to brett's gourmet restaurante ooh it's dripping the fries are already terrible they cannot be helped i need to like say a prayer [Laughter] what is that can i just i might have ruined it with a ketchup there were holes in this patty what do they do to it why are there holes they're like nobody's gonna know it's biden's economy we're gonna punch holes in the meat to save a little bit and after 18 patties we can make one patty for free is that literally what the world has come to that they're putting holes in hamburger patties now that also oh god that's like a piece of paper that they sliced up i don't want to know what kind of meat i've ingested so moving on to something better hattie bees you know them if you and you love them if you especially if you live here in nashville i'm going to give them maybe an extra couple of points because i do actually like their fries but they've been sitting in a soggy box so i know they're gonna be a little soggier they are but i like these fries not as well seasoned as five guys five guys takes the cake you can see like it's like they've salt baked this they were like and then that's basically it like there's a it's like hint of seasoning like hint of lime chips hint of seasoning but this this is what dreams are made of look at my hands oh god i need to what side do i want let's do this sorry they burned my bun real drastic does that constitute like taking points off that might this is not as good as normal usually it's a lovely golden brown hot what seasoning level did you get mild's pretty hot though it goes from normal to mild and then to medium right mm-hmm i usually get mild though oh okay well you know what i'm kind of disappointed in howdy bees like popeyes was better in this experience don't give me that little carter don't give me that look and this have you the burnt bun the hint of seasoning there was no seasoning popeyes with their semi-soggy butt seasoned fries above and the same level of spice i would like to compare the recipes of hattie bees and the popeyes aioli spicy sauces whatever because they do seem kind of similar but i didn't i am disappointed because i do like honey bees i'll continue i i think that this is probably just a one-time mistake so i'll probably give them like an extra couple of points off of this one experience because i know that they're good um i'm gonna move on to another horrific uh experience crystal look how many why can you only buy crystal hamburgers in bulk now if you don't know what crystal is allow me to give you some backstory they are kind of like a white castle competitor can we take a look similar boxes similar flat paper patties but the thing is i have a soft spot in my heart for crystal because there is this thing called the crystal hamburger eating contest and it went on for many years and it was held in chattanooga which is my hometown and my mom and brother went a couple of times it was held in the same pavilion where our farmers market was so like the town was very very invested in crystal tons of crystals all over chattanooga joey chesson i think still holds the record for however many of these he ate which just now with all of this sitting in front of me i don't know how he does it but i've never actually had a crystal hamburger but growing up i would always ask my parents to take me there to get the crystal chicks which is the chicken sandwich those are fire this is literally just white castle with some updated marketing let's see if they have holes in their meat look this is not look it's gray it's gray why did i agree to do this is it bad if i do catch up on this one too absolutely not well i am comparing it to white castle so i think i need to have like a level playing field let's just do a little a little drizzle drizzle i am a chef okay let's smush it in there okay [Music] nope mmm there's something very soggy than that it's like deteriorating in my mouth is it better than white castle yes there's some hint of seasoning they also have mustard on there so i don't think white castle did that little kick helped cover it up the texture of this horrendous but i'm giving them extra points because they don't have holes in their meat the holes are very weird it's like why are you doing art designs in my hamburger patty oh that's like a brick that's like a brick that might be because they've been sitting for a bit but this is dense so i don't even know if that's real potato probably it's not i shouldn't drop that in there because i'm going to make the rest of you guys eat it okay moving on bojangles all right first of all bojangles like i said the bow rounds the the chicken biscuits the cinnamon biscuits have you guys ever had bojangle cinnamon biscuits they are incredible when i was driving down to see my brother a couple of months ago i stopped at bojangles and i got those and they're incredible but i don't think i have ever had oh that's one of their chicken sandwich this is like rubber why is it making that sound it's so glossy it's it's like glazed but not in like a real butter way like fazzoli's fazoli's it's literally leaking i'm ner i this is gonna like ruin my appreciation of bojangles let's look at this let me actually let's spread some of this mayo out a wee bit unpopular opinion i don't actually know if it's unpopular or not i love mayo thank you okay nasty what you can make it homemade and it's so easy and it's good yeah literally oh yeah you just get that in the immersion blender you go to town it's great make an aioli mayonnaise is one of those foods that has a disgusting name that fits how it tastes mayonnaise just sounds so gross and that's exactly right i've been trying to put this off [Music] no no rojangles is trying to be popeyes and you guys need to stick with what you are good at and i love you but what you are great at are biscuits popeyes they're biscuits they're like bricks to me they're kind of hard they're usually kind of cold when you get them never the case with bojangles they are always elite this is like falling on many accounts number one there's no exciting sauce it is just mayo and i did just say that i like mayo this is a bit much no spice number two pickle sliding all around something else needs to be going on two the bun it's dense and it's plasticky it's just not it's not doing it it's not doing it but what the sandwich lacks in flavor the fries i already know it make up for in salt literally the most salty fries all right cookout i've never had before i'm slowing down guys um this is the favorite fast food restaurant of one of my best friends in the entire world amir i remember we went to a very fancy restaurant a couple months ago all my friends were in town his fiance came like two my two other best friends who were in from texas came had like a steak dinner you know appetizers all of this stuff and we were there for hours and he was like all right well we gotta go do something we're probably gonna go to cookout after this and i was like you're going to cook out after we just spent like 150 on some steak anyway i love him for it so amir this is for you i am trying cookout i'm already disappointed with your life decisions but i don't really know if i can trust amir to be totally honest because he does dip his cookies in water and that's not a lie oh this is literally falling apart but i can't totally judge these because they have been in a soggy bin what what is that what's that tick tock song watch me jiggle jiggle okay it's full so it's like what i think about this it's like hair i don't want that much how am i going to do this it's literally falling apart oh it's like squeezy cheese and it's connected to the bacon oh god what have i done i wanted all of them on there this bacon is interesting do we think it's real you always gotta plop your food really get the oh get the flavors in there i can try the bacon first that's not real that was horrific i'm snorting okay oh i don't need that bacon again that was literally plastic oh god i gotta puke do it [Music] nope this is where i every texture in that was wrong i'm a big texture person i used to not like coconut my coconut flakes because of the texture of the coconut flakes so i never want a coconut in anything and like i just i would enjoy the flavor of things but it was just if it felt weird no that was wrong the burger again brick the amount of like angel hair pasta looking onions felt very weird in addition to the fact that there was plastic bacon only on one side of the burger and the fat was clearly fake it was like play-doh in your mouth that's not really a good term like really really terrible taffy flavored like bacon is the best way that i can put it i don't even want to try these fries why are there so many of them fries actually are really good i don't trust you this is all bad i'm really putting the three bad ones right in front just not good that's not it so now we're doing zach's piece i do love zaxby's zaxby's is a very southern restaurant when i think of zaxby's i think of georgia i think of atlanta georgia i lived there for a year and we had a zaxby's down the street from the high school that i went to for one year was my one stint in public school and so we would go after school sometimes what is on this we still have we have the kind of plasticky glaze again i think because it's been in this bag for a while but these bags are usually pretty good like you pull out a chick-fil-a sandwich oh and it's still good zack sauce there's zack sauce on zack sauce is a classic it's on the bottom all right here we go i can't even do it [Music] do you think i've eaten the equivalent of a whole meal yes oh you're there you've been there i'm like sweating can you have like fast food hot flashes i will say that's real chicken this is not fake meat other things not so sure i do believe that zaxby's has real chicken i do like their zack sauce i think it's solid i would put it like a tear below hattie b's but it cannot it cannot reach the level of popeyes but i'm really torn on the popeyes versus hidey bees because i love hattie bees but that was that was killer these are super soggy so i can't really write them on crispiness flavor terrible no seasoning not an ounce of salt no kick no cajun plastic not a fan all right here we go last one oh my god we did it we have reached this has been has been a marathon not a sprint we're going to do kfc even though i am a southerner my family is southern i lived in the south for 10 years prior to you know leaving and then coming back now i think i can count on one hand the amount of times that i've eaten kfc and i think every single one of those was one of the big buckets of fried chicken that people had ordered like that my brothers got while they were in high school and i would go get a drumstick and go to my room that was basically it so this will be interesting i'm feeling taken out all right that is gross there's like mayonnaise seeping out of it i will say i'm making sheller ill let's lift it up for everybody to see button seems nice nice glaze but that is hard texture's a bit interesting here's this oh you like this shower my god this is the last one i'm having the meat sweats don't laugh at me bobby god water has never been so delicious okay i can do this i can speak that was good it's above bojangles which is sad because i love about jangles fries nope whoo no seasoning none overcooked way too thin what is that i didn't ask for a potato chip i wanted to fry so i probably put this below zaxby's right below it because zaxby's i think there the chicken had the same amount of seasoning but this had the zak sauce which added a bit of you know whoo um and i do like the chicken that zaxby's has i do though appreciate the crust on this chicken which is kind of what the popeyes has this i'm so sad literally no flavor none like papa not popeyes what what is your name bojangles do better all right we're gonna do rankings now i forgot i ate italian food this has been a journey okay i need this to go backwards i already know all right i have to start with the worst horrendous that was truly terrible crystal you have my heart because you you know my hometown connection that i never want to try that again also crystals are also ghetto they are maybe there's some nicer ones because you know what like mcdonald's they had a rebranding they were trying to be like a little coffee shop aesthetic you know like they're trying to you know put some new seating in there and they've got free wi-fi and they are i think it's nice because they're trying to make it a place where people can go and like work a vb i've definitely worked at a mcdonald's not like worked behind the cashier but i've like taken my laptop and worked at a mcdonald's like i'm not above saying that i have starbucks get hella expensive um eight nasty the textures come when can i remind you all of the fake bacon that tasted like probably human body parts and the amount the horrendous amount of onions maybe i ordered the wrong thing amir's probably gonna text me and be like you didn't get the right thing take me then preferably sometime when i've not had all this other food um all right i'm very sad to say this the jungles because i love bojangles it's sad but that chicken sandwich i i can't give the ranking for the entire restaurant but this experience right here not not great i'm gonna slide you right in here again not great i already kind of told you my rationality for that and then we have zack's face i'm just kind of working my way through the chicken first four left um fazzoli's five guys popeyes and hattie bees i think i need to start see i don't know if i can actually give hattie b's number one because it's not a drive-through and i think we put it in there because you know it's in nashville it is fast but i think for the integrity of this investigation the integrity of this ranking it should be something else plus they burned the bun today they did it was the whole thing was and the fries had no seasoning should i not there's a bold move but carter did it for you because masoli's is number three and i think that's a great ranking for me never knowing that it existed before and it being a total outsider in this world of sandwiches like a pasta trio the fact that you can go through a drive-through in the united states of america and be handed a platter of pasta that is something revolutionary that we should celebrate in itself now i'm down to these two this is gonna be controversial five guys gets number two which means popeyes is number one here's my rationality i love i love five guys that wasn't the greatest burger that i've ever had from five guys which you know different experiences but on the whole i prefer chicken sandwiches more than burgers there are very few burgers that i crave and it is not very it's not regular if i go to a fast food restaurant i get a fried chicken sandwich mostly unless it's in and out and then i have my normal order so that is my rationality obviously i think that these two are basically on the same level in terms of quality i like both of their fries they're very different obviously this is not cajun but it does have seasoning that does have crisp i also like the amount of fries you get i also think the popeyes really stepped out of its comfort zone with a spicy chicken sandwich like they were chicken and biscuits they were louisiana they were whatever they saw a gap in the marketplace for a solid spicy fried chicken sandwich in a world that chick-fil-a had dominated because they realized that this was not good that was mediocre this was only in one part of the country and they were like listen we got it and they did they crushed it i can i cannot believe i'm being this profound about fast food and you know what five guys is just universally solid and the best burger that i had out of all of this but because of personal preference popeyes is the winner uh now i feel like i should put a warning on this video it's like on tick tock when you're scrolling and it's like this was attempted by professionals don't do this in your own home please don't order this much fast food like the seed oils the processed food the sugar it's all killing us just saying so make your own food at home if you're in a pinch if you're really craving that popeye's chicken sandwich go for it if you're on a road trip i totally i totally support it but maybe next video i'll be cooking without seed oils using duck fat or something fun with some good ranchers meat um can you imagine the audacity of like somebody from good rangers trying either of these i'm guessing that i'm not gonna sleep well tonight and all of these processed foods probably threw off my entire chemical you know makeup and all my hormones most likely so that's very exciting um but if there's anything else that you want me to do a ranking of let me know i will have my team get everything and we will do this again because even though this was probably disastrous to my intestines i actually had a really good time and like i said at the beginning i feel like i'm a genuine youtuber now like i talk about politics we stream a little bit i played video games that was huge i've had guests i streamed with other people and now i did a mukbang and a ranking video with like a hundred dollars worth of fast food in front of me so mom i made it before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribe to this channel and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and i don't want you to miss a thing", "-RyjX5Djzhw": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper as you all probably know these days in hollywood they are all about doing remakes because apparently nobody has any new or innovative ideas people don't want to take creative risks because the safe option is to make a prequel or a sequel or remake a film or in disney's case remake movies shot for shot using the same songs the same plots just with real life people rather than animated characters i think that they are all probably bored out of their mind because nobody is doing anything new but of course we have to talk about this because guys the trailer for the live action little mermaid just dropped online but before we get into it make sure that you like this video if you have not subscribed to this channel yet i hope that this video earns your subscription make sure that you ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode i think disney posted the trailer yesterday or the day before this is still very very new however the world has known who is going to be playing ariel for over a year at this point but this debate about the casting has resurfaced after the trailer so let's just watch and then we're gonna get into it 24.8 million views on twitter alone like you can say what you want about these remakes i guess but they make money i feel like i'm watching an imax national geographic movie for like elementary school [Music] part of that word [Music] okay so i'm not even gonna lie i got chills i'm like i don't want to feed into the disney i didn't even grow up watching disney i don't even know if i have seen the original little mermaid but that was objectively beautiful the cinematography is beautiful the score is incredible that actress hallie bailey is stunning i mean look at her skin she is under nobody looks that good underwater her skin looks flawless she probably uses nimmy skincare which guys i should be using right now i actually just ran out of all of my products which you can see i have like two pimples on my face right now and i've been out of my nimmy for three days don't worry i have more coming like i'm telling you guys the way that my skin stays healthy while wearing you know on-camera makeup every single day is because of mimi they are my saving grace in addition to having incredible products that actually work they're 100 american-made too which goes to show american is just better they have incredible values they are anti-cancer culture and anti-woke they are absolutely based and if you want to go check them out go to nimmyskincare.com use promo code cooper at checkout for 15 off it looks like hallie bailey might use nimmy skincare because like i said she is absolutely stunning but as i am sure you all are aware her skin is actually what is causing this huge debate online because in the original little mermaid ariel is white she is white with red hair and in the dutch folklore that you know inspired the first disney animated film uh she is also white very danish as white as you can get basically and you know regardless of which bucket which side of this online disney princess debate you fall into i think we all need to just lay the groundwork be on you know the same foundation and agree that this move is inherently political because race has been politicized to the highest tier everything that hollywood does is political if you really wanted to work on representation why wouldn't you just make a new film and make a fantastic strong interesting black character rather than just going oh here we'll just you know throw you into this old movie the whole thing is just very weird and we already know that they are capable of doing this i mean think about princess and the frog that is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen i love the music in that film i love the story i don't even put that in the same you know bucket as all of the other crap that disney is you know pumping out these days but it is already possible to create something that is new that is interesting that is compelling but instead they're over here deciding to do this half-baked half-assed remake with a race swap just so that they can get progressive brownie points it's it's awful that's basically my take on the entire thing i think that that is pretty objective i think that the film looks nice she's beautiful she has a great voice but we have to admit that it is political and it is getting very politicized online the tweet with the most likes under the little mermaid trending page on twitter says racism is crazy because i'm seeing grown men actually they care about a little mermaid movie but it is very funny to see a bunch of adults talking about you know a disney movie but in the grand scheme of things this is about a much broader societal issue and something that is going on in our culture that impacts our children that impacts politics so yes i am going to talk about little mermaid even though i grew up not even watching disney this person brought in the uh danish folklore that little mermaid is based off of and they said the little mermaid is a danish folk tale y'all be the same folks talking about how white people have no culture and can only appropriate others while shilling for disney plagiarizing real white culture i make jokes about white culture and say like oh it's brunch and lacrosse but you know especially in europe there is you know caucasian culture this argument absolutely can be made it is hypocritical per usual but that is to be expected on the left that person made that comment on a retweet and they said white people when they realize mermaids aren't real so any race can play ariel i mean yeah she could be green for all i care i just want it to be a good movie somebody said me after that little mermaid trailer uh that looks like lizzo is lizzie becoming a mermaid i don't want to think about that that's unfortunate for me somebody posted this picture of a manatee and said the little mermaid should not be a black or a white actor she needs to look like this uh i mean that would be the most apolitical way to go about it but i'm sure that somebody would find something to be offended about the uh the manatee is too gray it is too close to some person's skin tone and that's offensive or something like that unacceptable the little mermaid trailer has gone viral in its own way on tick tock because people are posting videos of their children watching the trailer and reacting to it specifically um black and mixed kids and then freaking out about ariel being black and so somebody has done a compilation here we're gonna watch a couple of these and honestly some of them are very cute but i have some thoughts on it would you say she's black she's black and she has just like you and me she does she fell at me yeah she's brown like you that kid is very cute [Music] okay you guys get the gist of it um videos like this are literally racking up millions of views there's a compilation of all of these videos but i like i said those kids are very cute i like some of the reactions heartwarming but also i am a cynic at this point when it comes to parents i just want to know how many of these parents kind of baited their kids into you know having that reaction like setting up the camera being like isn't it sad that every princess is white isn't it isn't it sad like okay now watch this trailer and then getting a good reaction like i hate that that is where my mind goes but these kids having these very racially motivated reactions has to come from somewhere and it comes from parents putting race at the forefront of everything i didn't watch that trailer and go oh wow she's black that's really interesting i watched wow that is absolutely stunning and her voice is incredible that is the important part maybe she was the perfect person for the role and i love that and i'm so glad that she has it i do care about them making it political and us having this entire conversation but like what kid is sitting around thinking that this was actually my personal favorite reaction um you just have to wait this one is totally separate because it's not a black kid reacting to it it's just too good not to share [Music] [Music] like mom why the hell are you feeling me was it just me or was that with whitney houston okay so this has 83 000 likes on twitter and it's a cute video of a cute kid making a joke and people already found a way to make it problematic and you know racist like they were saying that kid she doesn't even know the difference between different black people that's a problem like she can't even tell the difference between this girl and whitney houston they think we all look the same it's literally a six-year-old kid her mom probably listens to whitney houston she's like oh look that's probably her leave her alone my other favorite comment was because it said blind reaction um people were going because that girl was not moving they thought that it was just a blind child reacting i mean hey that's a way to like skip over the entire race conversation the other video that i stumbled upon was uh one meme lord on twitter made a fixed fixed live-action aerial where they changed her race back to white like a cgi'd white she still has the dreads but she's white with blue eyes she basically still has all of hallie bailey's features listen you can do whatever you want with videos on the internet that's totally fine um but obviously people were triggered but i loved this comment somebody said meme lords and posters are a blessing on the internet another person said i can't imagine why this would make people upset i have been informed by twitter that mermaids aren't real so it doesn't matter what race they are owned owned i mean it's live action right it's supposed to be accurate with the original right imagine if it's mulan and it's played by a different skin color it's like that imagine if moana played by an asian or a white girl it just doesn't seem right and somebody responds and goes moana and mulan's races are a part of their story so changing them would be wrong aerials is not like these days race is part of every story lady just say that you're a hypocrite and move on but i mean if you want to play that game we can talk about how little mermaid is based on that danish folk tale so by your standards race does play into it she's a danish mermaid oh she's just white so obviously her race doesn't play into it give me a break i honestly don't have a firm super heated opinion on the subject because i think it looks like a fine film i'm not triggered but i also know that it's political and one thing that is absolutely ridiculous to me is people on the left are so upset that people are discussing ariel's race they're talking about the politicized nature it's like guys you caused this backlash with the racial division and the tension that you have caused for the last six years like if this trailer had come out without those societal trends i honestly wouldn't care i don't think anybody would they would just see it as another film and probably move on it is frustrating that now i will not be able to watch this film without thinking and knowing that this is just a political like representation ploy it is cheap and it just feels like a gotcha it feels like they're throwing a bone to all of these progressives that are screaming for representation and that they're oppressed it's just ridiculous and it diminishes and waters down the integrity of this film which what integrity does it have it's a remake of an animated film so that's saying something if you actually want representation in hollywood make new innovative and authentic creative projects don't just remake old animated films and shove people of color into lead roles so that you get woke brownie points that is offensive it really feels like a cheap blow-off using people of color and their alleged oppression as a way to get attention and sell tickets is just ridiculous like i'm not angry about this it just makes me want to roll my eyes but i really do not think that it is the representation win that so many people on the left are thinking like guys open your eyes they're throwing you a cheap bone get a grip hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "CiuWkH5fCKg": "[Music] welcome back to off the clock a subscriber sent me a voucher to redeem to do the understand myself big five aspects scale personality test that is a mouthful i have already done uh myers-briggs i've done the enneagram i did an episode with one of my producers where we talked about being libras the superior what is it called type and so now we're gonna do this one this is jordan peterson's version it's based on his psychology um of the more traditional famous five personality types test which i actually don't really know a ton about i was just on his daughter michaela's podcast and she talked about it and said that i needed to do it and since i've done these other personality things i had a bunch of people in my comments also saying that i needed to do it so i am very excited bear with me because i think it's a hundred questions so we're gonna get into it shortly i feel for my team who are now on their fourth video of me sitting here talking about my personality they know me better than anybody else in the world by now get back in that corner time out bobby yeah they're having so much fun they love it after lunch can i whip you nope oh a new fear ow one of my producers is already leaving the room because he hates me so much goodbye sheller your fans miss you i'll be back the

everybody it's best not to take the test under conditions that will make you more self-critical like being filmed and in a room with people that work with me that's great if you're hungry eat something first as hunger will make you more negative and judgmental i just ate ice cream so i'm good if you're feeling unhappier or more anxious than uh usual pick another time to complete the questions i'm pretty chill right now if you are currently depressed or suffering from anxiety disorder then your results will be skewed unreasonably towards the negative i'm fine uh if you are rushed wait to answer the questions until you have time to think we're staying here until 8pm everybody welcome to the night shift all right here we go following pages contain a series of items describing characteristics that may or may not apply to you for each item please use the scale to indicate the extent to which you feel the item describes you alrighty you seldom feel blue see okay this is not even about the question this is already just hurting my head the having to pick the scale thing i like yes or no but this is i'm gonna get it i agree that i don't often feel blue okay then it'll be a four i'm losing my mind already i would say neither agree or disagree i'm not like a happy happy peppy person but i'm not depressed i am not interested in other people's problems um four yeah i just don't really concern myself i carry out my plans strongly agree i make friends easily i can get along with people easily but i am not close friends with people easily so i would say too i have always struggled with friends to be honest and quick to understand things strongly agree i get angry easily uh no strongly disagree i respect authority three i leave my belongings around i used to i've gotten a lot better at that though i take charge strongly agree i enjoy the beauty of nature strongly agree that's nice and filled with doubts about things i strongly disagree i feel other's emotions i've said this before but empathy is not something that i feel like comes naturally for me but i've worked on it a lot so i don't know how i'm supposed to answer that maybe three neither agree or disagree i waste my time do do not i'm hard to get to know yeah i think on like a deeper level i have difficulty understanding abstract ideas strongly disagree rarely get irritated i don't get angry but i will get irritated so two i believe that i am better than others depends on the circumstance probably three because again it depends i like order yes i don't want to be told what to do but i like things like in order so yeah a strong personality you can say that again believe in the importance of art yeah four i feel comfortable with myself strongly agree inquire about others well-being yes i find it difficult to get down to work strongly disagree keep others at a distance i'd say three it depends on the person i can handle a lot of information five yes i get upset easily [Music] do know i hate to seem pushy no i don't really care well do whatever it takes to get things done it's all about efficiency keep things tidy uh pretty much again i've gotten better at it did not when i was younger i lack the talent for influencing people i am literally an influencer i hate that i hate that that's what i do but not really i don't think i'm an influencer that's just my own internal struggle with what i do i disagree i think i'm i mean again what do i do for a living i love to reflect on things yeah i do i spend a lot of time on my own head i feel threatened easily strongly disagree can't be bothered with others needs again depends on the situation but in general yeah i would just say three mess things up i don't really that often but not because i'm just like good at things but i'm i'm like very intentional and i think i i do things well but again it's like circumstantial i reveal a little about myself again circumstantial so i'll put three i think i've gotten better at this but it is interesting being on the internet i do try to be vulnerable and to be honest and to reveal things about myself not as like a means to an end to you know seem chill and relatable but because i do feel like there's a community here and in order to connect with people i do think you have to you know offer some of yourself but it is not something that i was always very comfortable with but as i grew up i realized that that is a good way of connecting with people and helping other people realize that they're not alone and that sort of thing because i am so public and on the internet there are things that i keep private so that i feel like my entire life's not plastered online so that's why i'm gonna say like in the middle but in general i feel like i'm pretty open these days i like to solve complex problems yes i keep my emotions under control yes take advantage of others no i follow a schedule yeah i know how to captivate people have i kept they're not even watching me right now the question was do i captivate people and i looked over and both of you guys are on your phones listen i captivate my subscribers okay they're like what's brad talking about now i love him i don't think i would be an actor or be on camera if i didn't but that does feel like a very self-aggrandizing thing to be like yeah i captivate people i was deathly shy when i started acting my mom put me in theater so that i would get out of my shell so again i think it takes skill and it's like a muscle that you have to work on i get deeply immersed in music yes i do i don't listen to like a wide array of music at all times i will have like two songs on repeat for a week at a time and they will encompass my entire being and then i'll move on to another two and not listen to those for months rarely feel depressed um either agree or disagree right now i don't but there was a time in my life that i definitely did oh you went to therapy for that guys don't be ashamed of therapy i sympathize with others feelings um yes i finish what i start yes i warm up to others quickly new avoid philosophical discussions strongly disagree change my mood a lot and either agree or disagree i avoid imposing my will on others strongly disagree no i would say too i'm very opinionated but i also it's not the end of the world if somebody doesn't agree with me i don't really care i'm not bothered by messy people depends on how messy if their life is a mess it's okay but i think this means like physically messy that doesn't bother me too much mmm it kind of does it doesn't bother me it bothers me it bothers me a lot and that one's still green wait for others to lead the way strongly disagree do not like poetry um two it depends on the poetry i don't really like the instagram poetry that i see a lot these days i think it started with you know like the books kind of like milk and honey and that sort of thing in my mind they're like fluffy poetry but i'm also the nerd that really likes the old epic poems my favorite poem in the entire world is in memoriam by alfred laura tennyson it is extremely long and it is depressing and it is about grief if you want to read it to know more about me you can i am indifferent to the feelings of others i don't walk around thinking about everybody's feelings that sort of thing i think that that i just can't i would fall apart i do not put my mind on the task at hand strongly disagree rarely get caught up in excitement there will be situations where there's a party or we're celebrating something and i'm just completely emotionless not because i hate the situation but it's just i'm not i don't get into the zone i don't know what that says about me because i can but i'm not naturally you know like that so i would say yeah really lose my composure strongly agree really put people under pressure um want everything to be just right i do like things to be you know in order and done correctly but i also don't like the just write because if i have to do things in a non-traditional way or you know go around some things to make something happen i'll do that so i don't really like order that much but i appreciate it so i'll do that one see myself as a good leader strongly agree i seldom notice the emotional aspects of painting in pictures two i am easily discouraged strongly disagree i take no time for others uh two i will take time for others i get things done quickly strongly agree i'm not a very enthusiastic person too i also feel like there's a difference between like excited and happy pepe and being in like enthusiastic like i will pour myself into projects enthusiastically but i won't be you know ypia whatever i have a rich vocabulary see i've been self-conscious about this recently because i had a couple of situations where i was you know mispronouncing a word but in general i do think that i do especially when i was younger i had a huge vocabulary as like an elementary schooler just because of how much i read right now i will say i spend a lot of my time doing stuff on the internet that i feel like i have kind of stepped aside from the part of me that was very deeply entrenched in intellectual works and academia and so that is something that i've been working on because i want to make sure that i'm constantly you know developing that and expanding that vocabulary and that knowledge outside of this kind of sphere so i'd say four because it's not the best that it could be right now but yeah i'm a person whose mood goes up and down easily too i insult people i mean not in my day to day i think i'm a pretty kind person but i mean on the internet you could say that i do make some jokes about folks bargain basement no no i think that there's a difference with people being nice and kind i think i'm a very kind person but i'm not necessarily nice again because i don't think i'm you know warm and fuzzy all the time i'm pretty matter-of-fact but i do believe that i am kind and that i do things you know the goodness of my heart now i feel like i'm like self-aggrandizing but i do think that there is a difference it's interesting growing up in the south i always felt like there were a lot of nice people but there weren't a ton of kind people everybody was like sugary sweet but then you would find out that like mary beth or whatever stabbed you in the back i was like oh god and then you're in california and nobody's nice and they're not kind i am not bothered by disorder i am bothered i can talk others into doing things yes i need a creative outlet yes i strongly agree i am not embarrassed easily yeah i take an interest in other people's lives yes i always know what i'm doing i would take and neither agree nor disagree my mother always says that i am the most overconfident person in the world and whenever i do a job interview and they're when they say the classic like what are some of your you know faults it always is that i'm overconfident which is very true because it helps me in a lot of ways but i also shoot myself in the foot because i'm like yeah absolutely i'll get it done i'll figure it out and then i have no idea what i'm doing i show my feelings when i'm happy yeah most of the time i think quickly yes i am not easily annoyed two i seek conflict no i do not i dislike routine again depends i'll do three i hold back my opinions no i do not i seldom get lost in thought disagree become overwhelmed by events hmm big social events yes actually which is interesting because i'm pretty extroverted but my like favorite type of extroversion i guess is just being with a small group of people that i really like or being in a work environment i was talking with my brother about it actually because he's very introverted but loves parties but when he needs to recharge he wants to be by himself i like being by myself and work very well by myself but when i need to recharge i need to be like in a work environment or collaborating with you know people he was very confused by that because he was going but you like hate being around big groups of people anyway so become overwhelmed by events uh i would say three so i think it's complicated i don't have a soft side no i strongly disagree most people don't see it though postpone decisions yeah i'd say four i have a lot of fun yeah learn things slowly strongly disagree i get easily agitated two love a good fight not really i really don't i like to see that rules are observed too probably it's interesting with the rules thing because in general i'm pretty non-traditional and i'm kind of like screw the status quo and that sort of thing i was at a soccer game recently here in nashville and they said like oh your bag is you know too big and for a bag that size it needs to be clear so we can see what's in it and then i went to another entrance and somebody wasn't looking and my friend was like just come in just walk in and i was like i'm gonna kick down i'm gonna get in trouble so those kind of things freaked me out but i don't know so i think that's where i get iffy and the first to act uh sure i seldom daydream strongly disagree no i would say two actually i won't let my daydreaming get in the way of the things that i have to do but if i have free time i will like get lost in my own head i'm afraid of many things strongly disagree only birds genuinely and like letting down my mother do things i like to do things for others yes i'm easily distracted uh two i would say laugh a lot yeah strongly agree i formulate ideas clearly yes i can be stirred up easily uh i would say three amount for my own personal gain yeah uh we should all be i want every detail taken care of no not really i do not have an assertive personality strongly disagree i see beauty and things that others might not notice i'd say sure all right next oh wait did i do it that was fast then i it was that was faster than i expected that's what she said completed assessment you can connect your assessment with the assessment of another user who has already completed it on once connect you will have access to a relationship report that will include the assessment scores results for both of you and a description of what you might expect from being in a romantic relationship with one another based on these scores well if you are in a relationship and you would like to do that that option is available for you as i was reading this i was literally like oh i said it's my mom but we're literally the same you've just completed assessing yourself with a hundred phrases here are your results you will see where you stand in comparison to others in the general population on the major traits and their aspects all right so agreeableness is compassion and politeness uh conscientiousness is industriousness and orderliness extroversion is your enthusiasm and assertiveness neuroticism is withdrawal and volatility openness to experience is openness and intellect remember that each personality trait and aspect has advantages and disadvantages it is for that reason that variation exists in the human population good luck with your expanded self-understanding thank you here we go agreeableness moderately low that's my compassion and politeness you're moderately low in agreeableness which is the primary dimension of interpersonal interaction in the big five personality trait scientific model has two aspects compassion and politeness which may be explained separately people high in agreeableness are nice okay here we go see i said i don't think i'm nice but i think i'm a good person they are compliant nurturing kind okay well now they're saying that you have to be kind uh naively trusting and conciliatory however they tend to be straightforward and even blunt so you know where they stand that is true i am very straightforward and you do know where i stand with people all right so my score puts me at the 29th percentile for agreeableness if you are one of the 100 people in a room you would be less agreeable than 70 of them and more agreeable than 29 of them people with moderately low levels of agreeableness are seen by others as somewhat competitive colder and less empathetic they are less likely to look for the best in others and are not particularly tolerant my haters will love that they are less concerned about the emotional state of others willing to engage in conflict and will sacrifice peace and harmony to make a point towards dominance rather than rather than submission they are also not easily taken advantage of by disagreeable manipulative or otherwise troublesome people or by those with criminal or predatory intent skepticism plays a protective role they will not easily lose arguments with less agreeable people they tend to be good at bargaining for themselves they are therefore less likely to suffer from resentment or harbor invisible anger in general women are higher in agreeableness than men oh this is interesting okay agreeableness per se is not strongly associated with political liberalism or conservatism but this is because the aspects of agreeableness predict such political belief in opposite ways and they cancel each other out liberals are higher uncompassionate conservatives in aspect politeness however alliance with the category of belief that is come to be known as politically correct is strongly predicted by agreeableness there we go not politically correct and not terribly agreeable you have heard it here first that's the first one i won't read that was a lot of reading i won't read all of it for everyone i think it hit the nail on the head where i have grown to be a lot more empathetic but like i said naturally i'm not really oriented that way and i kind of have to stop in my tracks if there is somebody especially that's like close to my personal life that it's like okay brett you need to take the time and you know be emotionally there for this person or communicate in you know a more emotional way a more agreeable way that kind of thing just because it's not naturally what i lean into but i don't think i'm necessarily bad at it these days anyway compassion i am typical or average it's one aspect of agreeableness so i'm in the 42nd percentile and i am low in politeness i am not obedient i can be respectful but only to people who clearly deserve demand that is true i can be nice but i also don't have patience but that makes sense their skepticism may make it difficult for them to find a place in the middle or lower hierarchies of power and dominance they tend to be strongly dominant rather than submissive there we go women are higher in politeness than men apparently not me conscientiousness moderately high all right it is a measure of obligation uh attention to detail hard work persistence cleanliness and efficiency adherence to rules standards and processes that's a lot mixed in there i would say i am moderately high in you know like efficiency hard work obligation yes i'm not very detail-oriented um don't love big picture rules but here i mean yes this conscientious people implement their plans and establish and maintain order true all right so 72nd percentile moderately conscientious people are dutiful they tend to slog away at a task until finished yes they work reasonably hard and you do not want to waste time they are less likely than average to procrastinate if a moderately conscientious person promises to do something they will do it and rarely be delayed correct we are neat organized future oriented and reliable that's all very true not usually distracted they react comparatively poorly to failure yes they tend to be judgmental and can be disgusted by their own moral transgressions that is true they suffer higher than normal levels of shame and guilt when unemployed or otherwise unoccupied yes oh my god i am so terrible at having free time if i am not doing something i feel guilty i thought that that was just because i came from like an extremely productive family but if i'm not working towards something even just in my career i feel immense shame i can't relax it's very bad even if i'm at a spa or getting a massage it's like okay i've got to get home and like do this it's terrible but i hey now i don't feel as crazy value hygiene i do now and then they might micromanage and exert too much control yes they are slightly more likely to be political conservatives rather than liberal there we go so i have hi okay here this is interesting high industriousness which is successful in school good at being managers they don't like to sit around they don't want to put things off they finish what they start but i am moderately low in orderliness which means i'm not really disturbed nor disgusted by messing chaos yes this is where it goes into like the detail-oriented stuff extroversion hi that's good to know that makes sense that's kind of in line with everything else extroversion is a measure of general sensitivity to positive emotions such as hope joy anticipation and approach particularly in social situations 84th percentile people who are highly extroverted have a difficult time keeping things to themselves and they tend to tell everybody everything they are self-disclosing and they work quickly to other people they tend to speak first most often in meetings they can be captivating and convincing they will often be the first to act here we go well suited to jobs involving sales persuasion go to public speaking there we go they are not suited to occupations that require a lot of isolated work i am not enthusiasm moderately low interesting let's see moderately low in enthusiasm means you are rarely excitable not particularly easy to get to know and not known for their talkative nature that is i mean yes and no i'm not easy to get to know but i can also talk to a tree which probably is good that i have this job since i talked to a screen all day they laugh uh more rarely than others i do laugh a lot though so i don't know tend to prefer solitude although they can enjoy themselves around other people in moderation yes more private people yep they do not crave the spotlight and if creative may find performing less desirable i do love performing hence my job so i think this one is moderately yes moderately no but also who knows then they said my assertiveness is exceptionally high i am in the 97th percentile for assertiveness my mother will be so proud take charge types they put their own opinions forward extremely strongly and constantly dominate and control social situations there we go exceptionally assertive people can be extremely influential and captivating which is interesting because it just said in the moderately low category that i'm not particularly captivating so i think i'm confusing this test maybe they have a communication style that is often associated with leadership this is good when they are knowledgeable competent and able but not so good when they aren't that's where my overconfident nature can shoot me in the foot people of action they don't wait for others to lead the way but they leap in heedlessly yes i can do that liberals tend to be less assertive than conservatives i like that they put the political stuff in there because that's really interesting because i do think a lot of you know allegiance to different political parties does kind of tie back to your personality and psychology low on uh neuroticism i'm in the 13th percentile i rarely focus on the negative elements anxieties and uncertainties of the past present and future that is true rare for them to face periods of time where they are unhappy anxious and irritable unless facing a serious sustained problem true they're good at keeping their head in a storm and they seldom make mountains out of molehills yes and again this has gotten me into trouble with friends where if there are you know people in my life that's like i'm dealing with this you know minor thing my normal reaction is like oh okay well that sucks uh we complain about it for five minutes and then move on and if they want to continue talking about it i'm not good at slowing down and realizing that maybe that means more to those people because for me it's like oh well i'll figure it out when good things happen to them people with low levels of neuroticism can accept it without questioning whether or not they deserved it that's pretty true withdrawal very low oh so i'm in the sixth percentile what does this mean i almost never suffer from or impeded by anticipatory anxiety they can handle new uncertain and unexpected threatening or complex situations very well that's true they are far less likely to avoid or withdraw in the face of the unknown and unexpected that's true people with very low levels of withdrawal feel sad alone so disappointed and grief stricken very infrequently and if they do they do not feel those emotions uh deeply nor for long that's pretty true even like with the grief that i felt in my own family with like the loss that we've experienced and that sort of thing i will sit in it momentarily but it is not something that is all consuming for me and it also kind of weirdly comes in waves but it's pretty infrequent and short and i think i do that intentionally but again my whole life is about efficiency so i like sit in it and i'm like all right we did it we felt the thing i'll move on people very low levels of withdrawal are simply not worriers yeah i don't really worry a lot volatility moderately low i don't very much in my mood feel lower levels of disappointment frustration and pain volatile people tend to get upset if something bad does happen while people high and withdrawal tend to be concerned that something bad might happen technically volatility has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate the fight flight or freeze so what does that mean does that mean that i um that i don't really have that openness to experience very high 95th percentile this is all very in line with my myers-briggs type i feel like a lot of these answers are sort of summed up in the entj thing so i i guess i answered them right maybe very high in openness to experience which is the primary dimension of creativity artistic interest and intelligence particularly verbal intelligence except when it comes to mispronouncing words apparently people with very high levels of openness to experience are extremely likely to be characterized by others as uncommonly smart creative exploratory intelligent and visionary now i feel like i'm just like stroking my own ego with this answer i am awesome strikingly interested in learning and are constantly acquiring new abilities or skills that's all very true very curious yes interested in abstract thinking philosophy the meaning of belief systems and ideologies yes seek out cultural events such as movies concerts dance recitals plays poetry readings gallery openings and art shows they are unusually likely to enjoy writing and they enjoy complex abstract ideas and love to confront and solve complex abstract multi-dimensional problems yep this is very very true i feel like welcome back sheller we're talking about how i am brilliant i'm just kidding they're entrepreneurial and spirit as well as smart and creative higher than average interest in creating new ventures openness to experience is the dimension that best predicts political allegiance those who are liberal politically are much likely to be very high in openness to experiencing conservatives that's interesting but i also feel like in the world of conservatism i feel like i am definitely more creative than a lot of people but that is a big issue with the right side of the political aisle because historically conservatives have been very bad at that intellect exceptionally high [Laughter] note do not confuse the personality aspect of intellect with iq intellect is a measure of interest in abstract ideas while iq is a measure of processing speed verbal ability in working memory that sort of thing so it's actually just am i interested in a lot of things my brain works too quickly for my own good i find complex rapidly changing occupations absolutely necessary and will excel at them i'm not at all suited to stable straightforward and more traditional occupations no i would i can't do that i cannot did that for a bit i get so bored of it and not even like in a way where i feel like i'm above it but i just physically get very upset if i'm in those boxed in situations openness high 84th percentile the closest synonym for openness is creativity highly open creative people love beauty they need an outlet for their creative ability like to collect things imaginative like to daydream and it can be extremely difficult to transform creativity into money or career and in general liberals are higher in openness than conservatives well that was it so there's no like rounding out at the end it i do like the fact that it breaks it up into these five very separate types just so that you can look at all aspects of it kind of separately i do think that what myers briggs if i'm looking at the other personality types and engram in a way i think if you just take those tests they really mush it up into like a contained like this is what you are you are this you know number or you are these four letters they do show how okay well if you're higher in this then this means it'll be translated whatever so you can kind of piece it together on your own but it does give you a good explanation for the different facets of your personality which may i think some of the other tests and explanations of the types don't do so well i should call jordan and see if what he thinks about my answers i'll save this and whenever i can get him on the show we'll do a special off the clock with jordan and we'll talk about it so anyway those are my types if you want to look them up again you can by this point i feel like you guys with all of these types know me incredibly well if there are any other tests that you want me to take whether it be personality or any more of those woke tests like the am i a feminist link them in my comments or like this person did email them to me and i will take it because i do enjoy doing this it is very fun before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribe to this channel and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and i don't want you to miss a thing", "okVzjTT7qFM": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper yeah i seem very happy right now and i'm genuinely in a good mood this morning but last night i was not because i opened up twitter and instagram and was bombarded by photos and videos of a specific event that happened in dallas texas last night you might already know what we're about to talk about but before we jump into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode okay now that we've gotten that out of the way we can talk about children and drag queens do we have to because on june 4th so this was saturday night i believe a bar in dallas decided to host an event called drag your kids to pride are you serious and it was a drag performance for children i have some videos here and i'm very sorry in advance for the things that you are about to see but i watched it so you have to as well [Applause] [Music] [Applause] like this isn't even good now two seconds into this video we have a little girl cute little dress sitting on a barstool handing this drag queen cash before the drag queen proceeds to slide down into a split look at what's on the wall here behind all of these events a neon sign that says it's not going to lick itself now these children might not know what that refers to but the fact that parents went on eventbrite and paid 25 to come to this bar with their i don't know six to ten year old children to watch drag i'm sorry it's really freaking weird if you're a parent bringing your kid but also like i'm just a normal like dude i'm going to come to the kids drag show by my groomer get it through your brain that we should not be sexualizing children yeah the first person under this video says texas has fallen yeah this did not happen in oregon or california or new york dallas texas now we know that austin's bad but apparently dallas is rising in the ranks somebody said that the kids find out what is not going to lick itself god that i can't get over that i also saw in the comments some people were defending the sign because apparently the bar is next to an ice cream parlor and so they're like it's probably about the ice cream like the kids don't know any better they probably just think it's like ice cream it's fine okay i'm sorry in the context of like half naked men parading around as women gyrating and like doing splits and then you have a sign that says it's not gonna lick itself it's not about ice cream get your head into the gutter and realize what it's saying so these are the rights they've been fighting for this is very disturbing god yeah we've gotten past the point of like fighting for equality it's the same thing with like third wave feminism where they're like we want our rights listen i have all of my rights we are all treated equally under the law the stuff that they're pushing now freaky another thing i noticed were people trying to find ways to basically defend this event and like shove it back in the faces of the people who were saying that it was wrong who were mainly conservatives on the conservative side of things and so like this one person says disturbing and then post a link to a video and it's inside the 5 billion industry of child beauty pageants basically insinuating like this is also disturbing you're gonna say anything about this another one was this one don't take your kids to drag shows and then it shows these two little boys in like a hooters with all of the like hooters waitresses now maybe some people on the right don't see a problem with either of those but i do i don't care if you're gay or straight don't take your children to those events like it's don't take your kids to hooters i don't think that your children should be doing you know beauty pageants at five years old or twerking on stage in a dance competition i mean that's your prerogative but it's freaky regardless of sexual orientation or party preference or any of that the sexualization of children is wrong now in case you need any more you know confirmation that this is freaking weird and that it was a real event i have the invitation here it says drag the kids to pride it is a family-friendly drag show at mr mister which is a bar in dallas a family-friendly pride event mr mister's drag the kids to pry drag show provides the ultimate family friendly pride experience this signature event is a family-friendly spin-off of our famed champagne drag brunch with our resident dj charlie presh playing some of your favorite hits while host nicole o'hara myrno brings together some of the best drag entertainers around under 21 guests can enjoy a special mr mister's mocktail while the moms and dads can sip on one of our classic mr mr mimosa towers do you want to hit the stage with queens we have five limited spots for young performers to take the stage solo with a queen of their choosing come hang out with the queens and enjoy this ultimate pride experience fit for guests of all ages no we don't want young performers on stage with the queens there were a lot of people that were saying it's just dance like stop making it inherently sexual have you watched drag it is adult entertainment it is sexual they try to defend it by saying oh it's just like self-expression and like happiness whatever yeah strippers can say the same thing they can say that they are expressing themselves on that poll it's not for children flekas on his youtube channel he sent somebody out there to interview the attendees inside uh and the drag queens and like the responses we just need to watch some of this [Applause] [Music] so we just got done with the drag your kid two pride event at mr mister in downtown dallas and i am here with noel sinclair and what is your name i am arielle diamond how do you think the event went today i think it was amazing i never get to like perform in front of children like performing in front of children i have like six other younger siblings so it was it was very emotional i loved it it was probably one of the best shows i've ever done why does performing sexual dances in front of children make you emotional in a good way it should make you emotional because you're realizing the horrible things that you are doing what do you say to the conservative parents that wouldn't bring their kids to something like this i mean it's very hard especially like a conservative family it's hard being a child and like growing up with such a religious or like conservative household it's so hard i guess be patient with your child learn with them because they're learning too they don't know what's going on so be patient learn with them learn as well educate yourself try to be a better parent yeah they don't know what's going on so to help them let's take their undeveloped brain to a bar to watch men strip in women's clothing not a great plan like it's just so weird it is so weird what do you say to the the children that you know whose parents wouldn't bring them to something like this that they have a place here they have people who will support them and continue to love on them and i'm so sorry that their family doesn't give them that but they can find family and others so just because parents will not take their children to a drag show means that they don't love them and don't they don't have support that's literally what she just said oh yeah this is another answer one of the queens gave that they don't need their families they can have family with others is literally a cult tactic another person commented on this luck's video and said almost every response from these drags is i feel they're so caught up in their feelings that they don't think yeah well that's most of the left these days to be honest now that was all happening inside of the bar outside there was more chaos another independent reporter um was outside interviewing the protesters and some of them were actually members of the lgbtq community who were saying hey this is taking it too far this is weird kevin what would you say to the camera about what just took place inside of this building right now this child i think it's very inappropriate i think it's very inappropriate [Music] okay because let me tell you we live in the dallas streamer house take it away yeah oh don't be trying don't go hey you want to get my let's go yeah let's see how this turns out get your ass up god that guy's based honestly this is the gay guy and he's being interviewed by this reporter here then gay antifa is sitting there in front of the camera waving as if that's going to do something when the reporter says hey get out of my camera he shoves him the cops are doing nothing they're just standing there with their lights flashing being like hey don't do this john doyle was there and he and some protesters got into a fight you people are the symptom of a dying society and you know it you're scaring [\u00a0__\u00a0] children shut the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up you're our child you're not a real woman shame on you shame on you shame on you shame on you shame on you shame on you that seems you know very mentally stable last one do you guys know who alex stein is i do admire that there's somebody out there with the balls to say these things to these people's faces because they're freaks and so it kind of needs to be said but here he is chasing down one of the drag queens after the show do you like dancing for little children you don't think that's disgusting dancing around for a little bit away from me don't you think that's disgusting i need you you should be ashamed of yourself dancing for little children you should be ashamed of yourself is he a child no you got you guys dancing little children you should be ashamed of yourselves you're disgusting think about what you just did okay that's fine but you danced naked in front of little children you did you did that you stopped you're dancing gosh chaos you know i usually try to wrap these up with some kind of you know message something we can learn but really the message is that our we're living in a dumpster fire and if you think the people are not coming after kids and they are not trying to you know steal your child's innocence and taint their brain wake the hell up because this is happening everywhere this is not just a one-off event and the most horrifying thing is that this is happening in government schools this was a private event that's at least semi-better but the ones that are truly despicable are the events that happen in like the sexuality club in middle schools and in high schools or bringing drag queens to freaking elementary school assemblies that is happening and again this was in dallas and a lot of these shows are happening in like ohio and wisconsin and all these places that people would think are more normal traditional america it's happening everywhere so be vigilant and pay attention to what's happening in the lives of the children around you i guarantee it will weird you out guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this

they asked my roommate was a boy or girl and i said neither they were like well do they have a boy name or a girl named i said neither and they said well do they wear boy clothes or girl clothes and i said what are boy clothes and girl clothes and they go you know and i said no my friend i don't know what our boy closing girl clothes and they said well what kind of clothes do they wear and i said well they normally wear jeans and a t-shirt and they said well what color is the t-shirt and i said all colors and they said well that doesn't make any sense and i said it doesn't have to make sense and then they walked away because they got mad at me that's pretty based they said that does not make sense and they pushed you on it somebody said that moment when second graders are smarter than their teacher these days i feel like a lot of elementary school students are probably smarter than their teachers", "RpPWf6KvgYo": "so i'm a member of a did system and for me right now that means that in the coming months i am going to be able to watch some of my best friends and some of my closest companions get the body of their dreams that matches their gender that makes them feel happy and in exchange i'm gonna have to give up my own i'm cisgender the majority of my headmates aren't and we've decided to transition which means that as happy as i am for the men in my system i am about to have to watch myself go through the wrong puberty uh and it's gonna be permanent anyways um everybody say congratulations to the men in my system because they get to transition and we're happy for them there's so much to unpack here this person has dissociative multiple personality disorder so when she's talking about head mates and the men in her system it's her other personalities so she's gonna go through a gender reassignment surgery because some of her head mates are male wow i'm gonna sit awake thinking about this yeah same bro same", "OXlJtPy6FyI": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper so I've seen this story sort of going around Twitter the last couple of days but obviously I was preoccupied with a major event in the United States but I really didn't pay it too much attention until I did a little bit more research and then I was absolutely horrified today we're talking about virtual reality now before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com to check out my merch collection I do not own an Oculus I haven't done a ton of virtual reality stuff my brother has one and like every Christmas and you know Thanksgiving whenever I see them I usually you know have a little round of beat saber I like that game I told the story at one point that I did play some zombie game with him inside of the Oculus thing and it was a horrifying time sheller and Bobby my producers have been wanting me to play um what's the horror game I was playing they want me to play Resident Evil 7 which I just played on the normal you know thingamajigger in virtual reality which sounds absolutely horrifying but I'm just putting that all out there I'm not a metaverse virtual reality Fiend I am very apprehensive about it because I like the real world I don't really want to live in a headset apparently there is somebody that literally wants to kill you with a headset and it's actually the founder of oculus this is the first tweet I saw it's from culture crave and it said the hashtag Oculus founder claims that he has created a VR headset that will kill the user if they die within the game that sounds great yeah this is just what we need more technology getting in the middle of our lives like technology is already invasive enough in my personal life like I literally walk around with this stupid tracker that's probably slowly killing me in my pocket my internet data can get sold to any company willy-nilly actually not mine because I use expressvpn big Tech is literally more powerful than most countries are and they profit by exploiting your personal data it's time to put a layer of protection between your online activity and these Tech Juggernauts and that is why I use expressvpn when you run expressvpn on your devices the software hides your IP address something the big Tech can use to personally identify you and expressvpn makes your activity harder to trace and harder to sell to advertisers expressvpn also encrypts 100 of your internet data to keep you safe from hackers and eavesdroppers on your network and expressvpn does all of this without slowing your connection that is why it is rated the number one VPN service by Mashable and techradar and I know this might all sound intimidating and confusing and I actually had no idea what a VPN was until I got to college I thought that it was something that was really hard to set up it really is not you can literally turn it on with a tap or a click of a button it is so easy to install there was no reason for you not to have this so that you can protect yourself so stop handing over your personal data to the big Tech Monopoly that Minds your activity and sells your information protects yourself with a VPN that I trust to keep me safe online go to expressvpn.com Cooper to get three extra months free again that is expressvpn.com Cooper right now to learn more they might not be able to protect you from this Sinister VR set but at least they'll protect you from the other parts of big Tech that is invading your life now apparently this is based on a science fiction anime series called Sword Art Online where a new technology called nerve gear is created within the anime that allows the character to play inside virtual reality video games and they face real life consequences in that virtual reality I don't come at me I'm sure that that is a very crude explanation of Sword Art online but it is a like written manga and I think it is a new Netflix series as well but you get the point I'm sure that there will be people in the comments that have a better explanation than I do but in the anime this new nerve gear technology is released in the year 2022. I have a here you go a screenshot and in the anime the characters will get killed in the game just like the Oculus founder has created in real life in 2022 because apparently he is a sick freak now the founder of oculus is named Palmer lucky I have a picture of him here and he decided that he wanted to make sword Arts online a real thing for what set us to reason I have absolutely no idea he actually wrote a whole blog post about it which is how the world learned about this creepy invention and we're gonna read a lot of it here's a title that says if you die in the game you die in real life literally horrifying now he first starts talking about Sao and explaining the impact of the series and the impact that this mythical nerve gear technology has had on his work on Oculus on virtual reality and then he gets into this all right here we go he says but that is what you're here for you want nerve gear the incredible device that perfectly recreates reality using a direct neutral interface that is also capable of killing the user I don't want that actually thanks so much Palmer I really don't the idea of tying your real life to your virtual Avatar has always fascinated me you instantly raise the stakes to the maximum level and force people to fundamentally rethink how they interact with the virtual world and the players inside of it pumped up Graphics might make a game look more real but only the threat of serious consequences can make a game feel real to you and every other person in the game this is an area of video game mechanics that has never been explored despite the long history of Real World Sports revolving around similar Stakes Sports okay is he talking about freaking soccer soccer as no comparison to wearing a VR Oculus headset that will explode if you die within the video game oh this is just like sports no it's not no similar Stakes it really is not he continues and he says the good news is that we are half white making a true nerve gear the bad news is that so far I've only figured out that half it kills you the perfect VR half of the equation is still many years out great thank God that it's many years out but I it's very uncomfortable to me that you've only figured out the part that kills people this just seems wrong on so many levels but we're not done you continue song in sio the nerve gear containing a microwave emitter that could be overdriven to lethal levels something the creator of Sao and the nerve gear itself was able to hide from his employees regulators and contract manufacturing Partners I'm a pretty smart guy but I couldn't come up with any way to make anything like this work not without attaching the headset to gigantic pieces of equipment in lieu of this I used three of the explosive charge modules I usually use for a different project tying them to a narrow band photo sensor that can detect with the screen flashes red at a specific frequency making game over integration on the part of the developer very easy when an appropriate game over screen is displayed the charge is fire instantly destroying the brain of the user this is not a perfect system of course I have plans for an anti-tamper mechanism that like the nerve gear will make it impossible to remove or destroy the headset so once you put it on you can't take it off this isn't how you play the game I mean this literally sounds like a horror movie actually I think this is very similar maybe to the plot of don't worry darling I have not seen it because I refused to watch that movie after all of the drama that ensued around it but I think in that film the husbands are creating something that could kill the wives it's some weird Tech thing like that I don't know don't quote Beyond it but you know horror movie stuff anyway he continues on and he says even so there are a huge variety of failures that could occur and kill the user at the wrong time this is why I have not worked up the balls to actually use it myself and why I am also convinced that like in Sao the final triggering should really be tied to a high intelligence agent that can readily determine if the conditions for termination are actually correct a high intelligence agent so there will be somebody monitoring this game that's like oh yep you did die in the game I do not trust any High Intelligence agents in our government in this country God forbid I would trust you with a ocular headset that could kill me absolutely not this is just Sinister and weird then he ends his little blog post by saying that as of right now the real life nerve gear is just a piece of office art for him it's symbolizing where VR can go and that this certainly won't be the last bit of VR technology that can kill you so we all have that to look forward to thank you so much Palmer for leaving us on that very positive note now I struggle with things like this because obviously VR and Technology like this it's incredibly interesting it's Innovative it's very cool it's objectively cool that we can create this but like do we really need to be taking it this far like a lot of times I look at this stuff and I think okay guys like humanity is Advanced enough what's that line where it's like we need to reject modernity and you know return to tradition that's how I'm feeling right now like we've done enough everybody go back buy some land raise some cows we don't need to be blowing each other's brains out with VR headsets for shits and giggles because we're all too addicted to video games go touch grass literally somebody said why did anyone want to turn this into a reality horrifying Black Mirror episode and somebody replied and said they probably got the idea from there and said [\u00a0__\u00a0] it why not make it happen that's the bad thing about putting certain [\u00a0__\u00a0] out into the world because who on Earth would have thought of that if they didn't watch that episode LOL very valid point somebody else said and people worry about drugs I mean I think drugs might be involved in this I don't know good bait because this is a little crazy somebody said this is one of the better ideas for a great reset than our Elites conjured yeah so uh covid didn't work like they planned so now we have a VR headset that is going to do population control I didn't actually think of that before now that makes me even more upset that's horrifying and I didn't pull any of these comments because honestly they just made me sad and I wanted to kind of focus on the broader issue about this VR headset but there were so many people in these comment sections saying like yeah I'd try that for sure I don't really have anything to live for why not yeah I really like video games I'd love to have it in like a real life situation that's so nihilistic that's so depressing you don't think you have anything to live for so you would be willing to put on a headset that you can't take off that would literally kill you if you died within that stupid video game foreign we have work to do on people's mental health a lot of people are also reposting this tweet from a video game and culture writer that was posted exactly a year ago about this very thing this was on November 8th 2021 he said sci-fi author in my book I invented the torment Nexus as a cautionary tale tech company at long last we have created the torment Lexus from the classic Sci-fi novel do not create the torment Lexus like I mean this all goes back to like the 1984 Brave New World stuff did we learn nothing are we so Daft do we have so few brain cells so we're like this is a great idea this worked out really well in this dystopian anime this worked out really well in this dystopian novel let's try it here no let's not go kick rocks dead a life we don't need this okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "2XE3SM4vlsg": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper you might notice that I have some new decorations on my set wow now I know some of you guys might get triggered because we are still a few days out from Thanksgiving but you know I feel like the holiday season is like really kicking into gear we're gonna have Thanksgiving and then it's like full steam ahead with Christmas I'm very happy I walked in and I totally forgot that the studio was decorated I immediately was so happy so just brighten my Monday it's perfect but anyway I digress let's get into today's Story the FIFA World Cup just started in Qatar and I truly know nothing about soccer or football as you guys call it but I do know when things are obviously ridiculous and this is obviously ridiculous but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection and I want to keep your eyes peeled for some fun deals coming this week first of all going into the World Cup the US men's soccer team gave their logo an upgrade this is the original Logo USA sort of a take on the flag all of that here's the new one rainbow yay jazz hands so much fun now I know what you're thinking Brett what is happening pride is in June do they really just do this in November yes they did because as we talked about last week pride is year round at this point it never stops all I have to say is that I did some research and I saw that the US men's team is number 16 in the world like guys that's embarrassing I think you have bigger fish to fry than being fake inclusive like maybe you could use some boncharge products to up your game Bon charge is an incredible Wellness brand with a huge array of products that help you perform better sleep better reduce inflammation balance your hormones and more now you guys know I love and I use their blue light blocking glasses but they also have products like red light therapy which would be awesome for athletes EMF and 5G radiation protection and low blue light bulbs and so much more the list really goes on boncharge prioritizes science back to technology so you can trust that their products actually work and right now is the perfect time to try them out because they are having a massive Black Friday sale there's no discount code needed right now just go to boncharge.com to automatically get 25 percent off their entire website until November 30th again that is boncharge.com for 25 off site-wide no discount code needed I might send some of those products to this US men's team because even though I don't follow or care about soccer y'all are an embarrassment so sorry now they changed the logo to be a variation of the lgbtq rainbow as a form of protest because to put it mildly lgbtq people in Qatar do not have the same rights that they have here in this country it is criminalized in Qatar and that in itself should put things into perspective for people like hey maybe we actually have it pretty good here in America maybe I should stop bitching and whining 24 7. but no instead they're changing their logo to be rainbow so that they convert you signal or whatever the hell they're gonna do somebody replied to this photo and said promoting lifestyle choices in regions of the world that will get you stoned literally does no good nobody wins it's a lot somebody else replied this is funnier uh thankfully and said a rainbow badge seems performative at best how about instead of the standard goal celebrations players make out with each other that would definitely send a message of solidarity or you know if country is actually cared about these social issues that they talk about 24 7 maybe they could have pushed to not have the World Cup be in Qatar wear lgbtq people are criminalized but per usual money always dominates their social justice agenda when push comes to shove the weird political pandering does not stop there this is the president of FIFA the night before the opening ceremony this is just ridiculous today I feel uh Qatari today I feel Arab today I feel African what today I feel gay today I feel disabled today I feel a migrant worker what is the point of that this slow well rehearsed I am every man I am I am a person of the world I am inclusive to everyone shut up you look like Gru that's literally the only thing I could think of somebody pointed this out I've played this video for you because what he just said is basically a direct plagiarism of Cuomo as a New Yorker I am a Muslim as a New Yorker I am Jewish as a New Yorker I am black I am gay I am disabled I am a woman seeking to control her health and her choices because as a New Yorker We Are One Community do they not real it lies how absurd that is and how ridiculous you sound you sound like some social justice Warrior 23 year old woman trying to do slam poetry in like an underground basement poetry bar or whatever those places are called shut up you think that you are portraying being some kind of worldly inclusive citizen but really you just look like a babbling idiot somebody commented and said imagine a time when you can get over your emotions and just let the sport be the highlight we came to watch football not to be indoctrinated the whole thing has been hijacked by other people's subjective feelings yes exactly another person said that's a lot of people he's feeling up and somebody replied to that and said In fairness maybe he's just feeling up one multi-racial gay expat who's wheelchair-bound ew somebody else replied and said I bet what he really feels is wealthy from bribes because that's why they're still in Qatar somebody else replied and said today I feel like my pockets are full of Qatari money I do however lack any morals my God in addition to people virtue signaling about gay rights and social issues in Guitar they're also pissed off about Qatar deciding last minute that the World Cup would be a dry event in Qatar the public consumption of alcohol is illegal and they had previously said that they would make an exception to this rule for FIFA but at the last minute literally the day before the opening ceremony they changed their mind but context is important here because apparently in 2012 when the World Cup was held in Brazil that country also tried to enact a similar dry event rule but FIFA said this this is a real quote alcoholic drinks are part of the FIFA World Cup so we're going to have them excuse me if I sound a bit arrogant but that's something we won't negotiate yeah it sounds bratty is right and absolutely arrogant you're right but now as they face Qatar 10 years later they're sounding a bit more docile obviously because they are getting paid in addition to no alcohol there are also restrictions on speech and religion according to NPR This is a quote they said Islam is the official religion of Qatar and anyone found to be proselytizing for other religions or criticizing Islam quote may be criminally prosecuted according to our state department and this was said in a fact sheet about Qatar for World Cup visitors they also said it is not safe to assume that you can practice your faith openly quote Qatar allows some non-muslim religious practice in designated areas like the doha's religion complex but all faiths are not accommodated equally according to our U.S agency and here's another quote while past World Cups have brought a heaping of arji barji scenes from rival crowds yelling or even singing obscenities at one another open conflicts can bring big problems in Qatar for example arguing with or insulting others in public could lead to arrest according again to our state department somebody replied and said the best part about Qatar hosting the FIFA World cup is how the Western world is having a complete meltdown realizing that there exists a world and culture outside their own Bubbles and exposing the hypocrisy with the sudden concern about human rights violations in the country like wow now you care okay somebody else said the World Cup used to be about football now it is just a woke Fest trying to justify being hosted by one of the most totalitarian Nations on earth now even though this is all the reality of Qatar everyone is determined to Virtue signal so that they can feel good about themselves while being there and taking that Qatari money we have to watch part of this opening ceremony and maybe some of you guys in the comments can maybe explain what's going on I know that part of the Quran is read there it's just all very confusing they also talk about coming together an inclusion which is obviously ironic and it stars Morgan Freeman they brought Morgan Freeman all the way to guitar to do this and a special little man I heard something not just music but also this call to Celebration this is all so new all that I have known for her was a land that seemed to be in turmoil with families [Applause] because everyone is welcome [Music] and now the world revealed even more distant and divided also the lip syncing is terrible yeah [Music] [Music] so they're basically trying to portray this whole like oh we're so inclusive we're under one big tent we're all loving each other meanwhile that NPR article I just read of literally everything you are not allowed to do if you are a visitor coming to Qatar for the World Cup what the players cannot do simply put this is all very ironic coming from a country that is not known before their love and acceptance and tolerance of everybody else if you catch my drift it's so confusing and the little guy I don't know what he was doing there Morgan Freeman wearing his glove with those weird shoes the lip syncing was terrible it was all I don't know what those dancers were doing also BTS The K-pop band then played immediately after the whole thing it's like a fever dream somebody commented and said hmm weird to see Morgan Freeman on stage at a questionable World Cup and Qatar but I guess as long as the bag is big enough morals are secondary a mirror for society plus that lip sync was terrible another person said kind of reminds me of The Hunger Games opening ceremony yet literally somebody else said everyone is welcome here sure again basically the general consensus here the through line that everybody is pointing out is that money means more than morals and this is on display apparently 24 7 at this world cup I still don't really know what is going on it's chaotic so let's just bring it back to home soil with some inspiration from one of our fearless leaders coach put me in I'm ready to play you guys I know you're the underdog but uh tell you what man you got some of the best players in the world on your team and you're representing this country and I know you're going to play your hearts out so let's go shock them all guys you want to say hi they all seem stoked we've got this I know you will I know you will all right that was nice huh guarantee the cameraman was like you guys gotta amp it up you gotta be really stoked like that guy he was absolutely faking it like that was nice he was like oh yeah oh yeah Biden really dude no two seconds ago you were barely mumbling hello you don't get a rousing speech from Joe Biden that's just not possible it's like truly painful somebody commented and said Biden has no idea what sport they play or even what is going on somebody else said they don't look excited for a call from the president at all and somebody said using quotes around the word president is a choice yes it is because I think we all know he's basically a puppet anyway that is the update about the world cup from somebody who has watched one soccer game in her entire lifetime but still knows that this is absolutely absurd this has just now started I'm sure that there will be more woke virtue signaling I'm not sure if I'll do another entire segment about it just because obviously I don't know anything about soccer but I enjoyed diving into this new sport just for you

told my parents i was a girl and until i was 18 years old everyone thought i was a girl and this was super super uncomfortable for me because i knew that wasn't right so when i was 18 i told my family

demonstrating why he she can never get laid and hence has to identify as asexual but also leave a small window for the off chance that someone does take interest so they identify as cupiosexual that actually is a great way to put it sounds like they just have some low t not everything anybody feels on a given day needs some title these people just love feeling different or special you say that and i think you think that that person is a man that is actually a woman did you see those boobs so maybe they are just high on t low on e i don't really know why did i just have to spend a minute and a half watching you have a mental breakdown", "siC0WPQjROA": "it's day 43 of being a girl and i'm in my canopy bed you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna stay right here girls deserve to stay in bed

now no i am not so we are not gonna feel guilty about staying in bed if we wanna stay in bed all right you deserve it this is your sign to do so and i'm gonna re-watch bridgerton season one right now because it is better than season two but we still love it his stereotypes about girls he's not wrong but also those are not the only things that make women women i am much more than my bridgerton

to the restaurant yeah what time 7 30. okay I'll see you there that's how men communicate with each other here's how women communicate with each other hey what are you doing tonight I don't know my hair is all [\u00a0__\u00a0] up but what do you want to do later I'm not sure the conversation goes [\u00a0__\u00a0] everywhere this type of conversation is very natural and normal for them when you go and you're talking to girls and you want a Vibe or chemistry with the girl when the girls like we have a Vibe or we have chemistry what she's really saying is when I talk with him it feels like this and it feels natural and normal and so being able to do both of these things I think is really important for a guy that's actually like so true everything he said is spot on and I also think as women we change the way that we speak and we communicate at least I do in different environments if somebody said that feminine conversation begins to look more like an ADHD conversation yes because we can never get to the damn point it's not our fault", "XY8CXgRo9FM": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper two nights ago my boss and uh lookalike ben shapiro went to speak at unc greensboro for yaf and like i mentioned in yesterday's episode those college campus speeches are often followed by you know protesters and pushback i mean it's all basically expected at this point but this time it wasn't protesters who were going viral it was one kid that thought he could outsmart ben but this was during the q a portion of the event so let's just watch this this is the original clip i'm a mathematician and a physicist here a double major and i also just won the most prestigious award in the country to pursue research at any institution i want the national science foundation graduate research fellowship so i think i'm pretty you know qualified to say that most of what you're saying is based on like old data okay so that's how he starts this whole thing by claiming that he's a mathematician and a physicist no you're just a student taking those classes also why is he wearing a beater who is he john mcclane welcome to the party pal also i looked up the award that he got the national science foundation graduate research thing it's not that prestigious like 20 of applicants get in and i think only 12 000 people apply so sorry dude i don't really think it's that big of a deal not even 30 seconds in he switches to ad hominem attacks i mean he gives up so fast and you can't even make your wife web bro so what's good it's a bold strategy cotton let's see if it pays off for them okay excluding the uh more explicit parts how does that put you in any position of authority or retaining any semblance of respect like you just lost it it went completely out the window then he decides to bring other cultures into it claiming that two biological genders is a white colonial trope no i no think about native americans third gender people i'm not saying that third gender people like native american societies western african societies like southern native american societies like mexico so in other places that are not white dominated and they're united states or europe and so i'm a mathematician and a physicist anyway you get the point he is insufferable and it ends with ben telling him that whoever gave him that prestigious award should revoke it obviously the kid was getting booed at the event and he got roasted in the replies of this tweet boom roasted somebody said and just think with all the wokeness going on this young man could end up as a diversity higher nasa my personal favorite is um mexico what young man leave most mexicans out of this we're just trying to make a living go home eat that asada and watch some novellas okay so if you think that that's the the end of the story you're in for a treat nothing is over this kid quentin is his name who was up there trying to own ben with emotions and logical fallacies uploaded a video yesterday attempting to defend everything he said the title is i'm not sorry ben shapiro it's like the reverse of one of those emotional apology videos after you've been canceled like the really ultra dramatic ones it's the complete opposite of that okay this is too good to cut up so we're just gonna watch this whole thing together and i'm gonna react to it hey my name is quinton mary and i just roasted been shapiro did you though but before i get into my the reasoning behind my actions i'm gonna give you some background about my experience at the event i went with a friend and we strolled through campus to get to the gym you know waited patiently in line shuffled through security all to get to the biggest and most controversial event of our time in college ben shapiro at uncg first of all he's reading off of a script that is clearly like to the left of his camera this is a terrible terrible monologue this man should go take an acting class that's all i'll say walk down the stairs and try to squeeze into our seats and settle in for the event we hear someone yell i hate minorities just like that i'll take that didn't happen for 500 alex it's a total fabrication it never happened my friend and i immediately looked at one another with shock him wide-eyed looking at my black skin and me uncomfortably staring at his brown skin against the sea of white faces that surrounded us i mean that was to be expected given vince appears demographic no if you look at the video of the actual event it's not a sea of white faces that's an absolute lie you're starting off on the wrong foot but what i did not expect was the lack of response to the hateful statement that resounded in my ears no one batted an eye or turned their head except for us the lack of care by the people who surrounded me most of whom share the same views as ben shapiro stirred a fire within me and that's when i made my decision i posted to my snapchat story and i said that i was going to hackle him and when they asked is members to go down for questions i went down there with that in mind so he intentionally was just trying to heckle ben none of this was in good faith he wasn't actually trying to you know ask a question and learn something he was just pissed off and wanted to start a fight on my way up there i asked myself well what does vince shapiro do you know he uses influence as a political commentator and touts his credentials from his harvard law degree to give himself the credibility to speak on issues that he's not qualified to speak about so i did the exact same thing and for those of you on the internet saying that there's no way that i possibly won this prestigious award i'm sorry to tell you that you're wrong you know it's true i was awarded the national science foundation graduate research fellowship and i'm a double major in mathematics and physics this is what black excellence looks like dude we can look up the award we know it's not that prestigious i think the only qualification was that you have to be like going to you have to like be wanting to enroll in a graduate program this is going terribly for you sadly i do have to agree with one point i've been made about me he's right i'm not a biologist and that's the point neither is he so in reality the people in that audience should be listening to neither of us regardless of our personal accolades or achievements and should actually listen to the biologists and psychologists doing the real research in these areas and the research comes to an undeniable consensus that being transgender is not a pathology it is not a disease it is literally just a different way of being a human being so again i'm going to be very clear i'm not sorry about what i said to ben shapiro however i do want to apologize for the sexist language that i used back in 2020 ben shapiro spoke on his podcast about the song whap by cardi p where he was rightfully mocked by the internet for awkwardly wrapping her verses then he took to twitter and said also as i discussed in the show my only real concern is that the women involved who apparently require a bucket and a mop get the medical care that they require my doctor wife's differential diagnosis bacterial vaginosis yeast infection or trichomoniasis and what that basically means is that he's equivocating the physical attributes of female sexual arousal with disease again twitter rightfully dragging for this you know we're being so painfully unaware of the biology of cisgender women this then begs the question are we really going to trust someone like that to even attempt to try to tell us about the biology of transness when i got up there i brought the content of that tweet because i knew it would hit him where it hurt you didn't bring up the content of that tweet you just made personal attacks about he and his family ben shapiro and i don't have a difference of opinion the hateful and transphobic rhetoric that ben shapiro spews has the ability to do real and tangible harm to people in the transgender community because he has the platform to reach the people who write the policies and laws that might end up restricting the rights of trans people as a black person and a queer person i had to call on the experience of the people who questioned injustice and fought for change before me the majority black and brown queer people at stonewall didn't lay down and just take the abuse of their oppressors neither did the organizers and allies at the march on washington marginalized people should not be expected to be docile or respectful to the individuals aiming to reverse the progress we have fought so hard to gain rather we must be bold and speak out and find ways to dismantle oppression by any means necessary and if engaging with bin shapiro is the avenue that i had to take to fight injustice and spread this message then it was well worth it black power brown power queer power trans power remember there is no liberation for any of us marginalized people if there's only liberation for one of us we must work together if we're going to achieve an equitable society for all of us okay what about female power he went through every oppressed group i feel very left out also at the end there i thought that he was going to do like a wakanda forever thing [Music] there's just so much to unpack here i have never seen anything so blatantly arrogant and full of straw man arguments i mean it's like he's just trying to cover his ass because he knows that he just lost this debate that wasn't even a debate he just heckled somebody i mean come on it's clear what he's trying to do like he just got into a viral spat with the ben shapiro and now he's just trying to ride the social media wave i have not seen a single positive comment on this video that he posted all the ones that have gotten the most likes are just ruthless this whole thing is like a car accident on the side of the road i know i shouldn't but it's impossible not to look fortunately nobody was injured with this incident except all of us listeners who lost 10 iq points just through secondhand ignorance dear quentin if you read this learn humility and stop embarrassing yourself in front of your country in the world boom where's will smith when you need him someone shouted i hate minorities give jesse a script back yeah okay so this comment has to be followed up by this one that i saw we were at the event sitting maybe 20 yards from this gentleman if he believes he roasted ben shapiro or not is his own personal opinion he knows everyone laughed at him after he and ben got finished what i can tell you with certainty is that no one yelled i effing hate minorities no one reacted because it didn't happen even if it did security was very present and escorted anyone out who shouted obscenities or really anything for that matter i hate the people will see this and believe it actually happened trust me we're not believing it he was not the only minority student in attendance and i assure you if anyone had yelled the security would have been on them in a matter of seconds just like they were with everyone else who wanted to cause a disturbance that did not happen i mean he's literally jesse 2.0 is that his mentor is that who he's looking up to this guy is a walking argument for not forgiving student loans yeah i basically sums it up look up the personality disorder called narcissism in the dsm-5 seek help oh yeah this is the no comment section of the comment section these people have the biggest egos of anyone i've ever seen and the moment that their argument argument is threatened they just turn to personal attacks and other fallacies to try to salvage themselves which just ends up looking even more pathetic but that's what identity politics and contemporary higher education is teaching it's it's cheap shots there's no critical thinking there's a lack of respect we see it everywhere and this guy is a beautiful example so thank you quentin for teaching us all what we should not be doing do you want to be the only person that is not caught up on the internet's latest chaos i don't think so so

advance for this segment because i think this might be the scummiest pop culture story i've ever talked to you guys about but i promise there is a lesson in here and we can really round this out to talk about the current state of our culture so just stick with me and if you're not a pop culture person i just hope that maybe i can get you like a tinge invested in this kind of story because this really is you know the forefront of the culture war this is kind of what we're dealing with on a daily basis but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode and of course you can go to dailywire.combrett to check out my merch collection alrighty so if you've been on the internet for the last 24 hours in the tick tock twitter pop culture sphere you know that something is going on with adam levine now just to set the stage a bit before we get into all the scalding hot tea all the juicy details adam levine is the lead singer in the band maroon 5 which is you know a band that was very very popular especially in the early 2000s still they're pretty popular even though their music now was kind of glorified elevator music in a way my producer sheller hates them with a burning passion and i've been singing them all morning just to annoy them i think i've made his day incredibly awful anyway adam levine he is married to a stunning victoria secret model named biati prince lou they've been married for many years they have two kids and they just announced last month that biati is pregnant with their third child and then this video pops up on tick tock yesterday morning it has now racked up 15 million views on tick tock alone i don't know how many views it has on twitter and other platforms it has gone crazy like the tabloids had not even seen this yet when i watched this video yesterday morning so this is what's happening i'm just gonna band it off because i've retaken this like 10 times now essentially i was having an affair with a man who's married to a victory secret model at the time you know i was young i was naive and i mean quite frankly i feel exploited i wasn't in the scene like i am now um so i was definitely very easily manipulated maroon 5 is practically elevator music at this point so i'm sure you know who adam levine is um but adam and i were seeing each other for about a year after i stopped talking to him over you know a period of months this is uh how he came back into my life he said okay serious question i'm having another baby and if it's a boy i really want to name it sumner you okay with that dead serious um i was like i'm in hell like i have to be in hell at this point i mean my morals were unknowingly compromised i was completely manipulated when i healed this privately i never wanted to come forward because obviously i know the implications that come with doing what i do making money the way i do and being an instagram model only fans model um so being tied to a story like this it's like i know stereotypes i had sent um i had sent some screenshots recklessly to a few friends i thought i trusted and one of them had attempted to sell to a tabloid um so here i am and that is the video a minute and 30 seconds and the internet has literally blown up there is so much to unpack here but basically this girl just graduated recently from a university in texas she was saying that she was young and naive when she had a year-long affair with adam levine which apparently only ended in april because there were messages from april but in the last six months she's really just matured and she realized her morals were compromised i'm sorry i don't think you can say that your morals are compromised when you are having an affair for a year with a married man who is very public about the fact that he is married features his wife and children in his music videos i would say you have no morals there there is nothing to compromise you literally have none you are not even remorseful she did not even issue an apology she just claimed that she was exploited she's trying to make herself into a victim all she is trying to do here is get ahead of a tabloid story that would probably slander her name and position herself in the limelight because it'd probably be better to get the story out from her own voice get all of these clicks get everybody looking at her instagram profile get everybody clicking on her only fans because she's an only fans model probably better that she dishes out the story rather than tmz so really this is all just a self-serving agenda the comments were not kind somebody said i think she forgot the apology somewhere another person said it's no secret that he has been married for a decade the only victim here is his wife and children yes somebody said young and naive bro this was less than a year ago yes less than six months i was i was new to the la scene that's not an excuse at all somebody said i did not cry too i don't mind spending every day out of your corner in the pouring rain for this in its peak maroon 5 i will say sheller's gonna hate this maroon 5 had some nice songs some nice love songs i do think that adam levine is a tad bit annoying fun fact my mom is going to hate him after this but diane has always said that the only person that she likes with facial hair is adam levine i don't know why but she said that when we were watching the voice one time she was like the only person who can pull it off is adam levine i don't know if she's seen matt walsh maybe she's changed her tune but diane cooper she hates facial hair somebody responded and said wait how are you exploited here and she said doing a part two and she did in fact do a part two many hours later i was stalking her instagram and apparently she's in like costa rica with her only fans modeling agency so she took time away from her vacation to get ahead of the story so here's her part too i just wanted to make a part two um i feel like that's obviously necessary yeah no [\u00a0__\u00a0] um hindsight is 20 20. i initially wanted to go in and talk about how remorseful i feel and how embarrassed and disgusted i am with myself but i she's terrible i want people to look at it and think like oh she's playing the victim but in reality it had the opposite effect something i now realized i didn't touch on enough was the fact that um one of my friends had attempted to sell it which i realized yesterday whenever they reached out to me for comment and so i was completely frantic that is why that video is for one just so all over the place into why i didn't touch on some of the things that i initially would have liked so in this video i'd like to address some of those things i only came forward because i wanted to kill whatever story the tabloid had and get me the attention part that i did definitely gloss over is the fact that i was under the impression that their marriage was over i believed that they were keeping it quiet to avoid the negative press because as i had said i was new to l.a so i just assumed that with celebrities of that caliber that that's just how it was and that's why i feel exploited because he knew i believe okay the marriage is not over until the divorce papers are signed wait you're kidding right you literally could take a easy google search and you could see them in pictures together them talking about wanting to have another baby them looking happy i'm sorry you have to be an utter [\u00a0__\u00a0] if you are that intimately connected with a man for a year and you cannot decipher that he is staying with his wife i can't hear you it's too dark in here like you are an idiot i do not think that you're remorseful okay moving on also he was damning me straight from his verified instagram account i didn't have any reason to further question it but i now realized that that was likely a manipulation tactic of his you know just hiding in plain sight as soon as i had realized that was not the case i had cut things off him in retrospect i wish i would have questioned things more i wish i wasn't so naive but you know being naive is not an excuse for what i did in the role i played in this again in no way was i trying to gain sympathy and i fully realized i'm not the victim in this i'm not the one who's really getting hurt here it's biati and her children and for that i'm so so sorry so in the last two seconds of the video she says that she's sorry and she admits that she's not the victim i wasn't trying to seem like the victim no in that first video all you talked about was how you were exploited and then for the first 90 of this video you talked about how you were vulnerable because you were new to la i'm sorry la is a weird place yes but also it's very superficial it does not take that long to figure out being new to the scene is not an excuse for terrible behavior your moral compass is not dictated by the place that you live it might be dictated by the people that you surround yourself with but still you can be a better person find new friends find a new scene somebody said vulnerable position of being new to l.a lmao yep thank you people were calling her on that another person replied and said girl they are eating you up on the bluebird app yeah hell yeah they are twitter has been going wild like if you guys thought we were just going to end this episode with the tick tock drama you thought wrong because we are just just getting started i need a freaking drink this gold tumbler actually reminds me of the time that i drove jeremy's mclaren have i told you guys about that i've been brought out to this abandoned strip of road to test drive the god kings mclaren oh my god this is insane [Music] [Music] holy crap my god you like feel that there you don't even like have to touch a parking brake it just knows we're going back we're going back it's just it's just what this car makes you feel like a man like i'm a woman but driving this makes you feel like a man kind of like shaving with jeremy's razors to be quite honest i hit 140 this time [Music] that's all i'll say i literally can't even believe that doing stuff like that is part of my job it's actually insane and i am pretty sure that if i had more track i could have gotten it up to 200. like just saying it was up to 140 but i was slamming on those brakes real quick i want to try again now get this jeremy told me that since he's driven it once and now i've driven it the car is used and he doesn't want it anymore which means don't get excited it could be yours obviously though he is not just giving it away this is jeremy boring we're talking about this is not joe biden he does not do handouts so if you want mclaren you are going to have to make it worth his while by getting all of your friends to give him their money here's how you do it go to jeremy's razors dot com slash play to get your unique referral link when somebody uses your link to buy a jeremy's racer shafe kit they get a whole 12 off you get store credit for new upcoming jeremy's products and you both get points in the race to win the god kings mclaren you also get points if your friends join daily wire plus now one of you will win the car the rest of you won't but everybody wins because you will have rescued a bunch of your friends from the woke virtue signaling razor companies that insist that men can be women that masculinity is toxic and that women should not shave their armpits now that is progress now listen i am giving you the scoop on this you have got a head start people listening to ben's show won't even hear about it until tomorrow so get on it right now by going to jeremy's razors.com play and start competing for the car i wanted to join you and do the contest but legal said that as a daily wire employee i cannot participate blah blah they're basically just being a buzzkill so fine i'm just gonna keep this gold tumbler instead for more information and to see the full video of my test drive go to the video on my channel and remember friends don't let friends shave with woke razors i was just thinking about it and i i think adam levine would literally hate jeremy's razors because they actually promote masculinity and good values of which adam levine has neither the little beta [\u00a0__\u00a0] anyway this story did not start trending on twitter until later in the afternoon i was literally sitting there in the morning being like please people start tweeting about it i saw this meme where a girl said sitting patiently waiting for the adam levine news to hit twitter literally me yes i don't know how i ended up seeing this video within an hour of it being posted but i ran to twitter because i knew that i was going to talk about it on the show and there was nothing it was just like this and a few other people being like i'm waiting i'm waiting it was literally me anyway somebody said after adam levine cheating on his wife let's remember and normalize the fact that cheating was never about a woman's lack of beauty worth or anything for that matter but instead a man's abundance of insecurities unworthiness and desperation don't let men manipulate that reality yes we're going to talk about this in a bit but even though men cheat i don't hate men we need to empower men and make them better and as a society continue to support men and make them healthier so that this does not happen and also encourage women not to be toxic [\u00a0__\u00a0] and engage in affairs somebody said breaking douche bag looking adam levine is confirmed to be a real-life douchebag yeah look at him looking all weird ass oh god i can't look at him ever in the same way again i'm sorry mom his facial hair it's not gonna cut it this time somebody said remember when adam levine played the lead in maroon 5's music video for she will be loved where he cheats on his girlfriend with her mom it just felt relevant today yeah well he kind of predicted his future you gotta notice the red flags early on apparently another person tweeted and said everyone on earth knew and knows adam levine is married choosing to date him anyway makes you an ass not a victim yes and truly even though she gave her one second apology at the end of that video i do not think that this girl has any remorse the only reason that she came forward is because the story had been sold to the tabloids she wanted to get ahead of it she wanted to get media attention literally the only reasons if she actually had remorse she would have cut off the affair she would have spoken to biati privately said i am so sorry handled it under the radar and let them figure out their marriage because by doing this she is now airing out all of this family's dirty laundry these poor kids i don't know how old they are are seeing their parents [\u00a0__\u00a0] in tabloids online biati is having to deal with this while she's pregnant publicly that is not the right thing to do at all you are not taking accountability it is a completely self-serving move in the midst of the affair she was posting videos like this like this was not sly [Music] that is an adam levine song called beautiful mistakes and she's laying in her bed rolling around this is when the affair was going on yeah again not sly poetic really uh here's another one and every time he leave me long he always tell me he missed it you don't even have to like watch more than one video to know what she does for a living is all i'm saying but uh the caption of that video is when he's on tour and then says that she's lonely you're not hiding the fact that you are dating a touring musician under the radar uh here's another one [Music] when he says he only likes blondes yeah adam levine's wife biatti is a blonde you taunting little sly [\u00a0__\u00a0] here's another one i really like letting her have it [Music] [Applause] so this one she captioned brunettes be winning the first part of it is i bet you're with that blonde girl it's an olivia rodrigo song and then she goes never mind do not care brunettes stay winning and then she's twerking and then there she is dressed up like a victoria's secret model again she's being like taylor swift leaving easter eggs hints all over the place i saw a picture on her instagram where she posted a picture in a bikini well basically her entire instagram is pictures of her in bikinis and one of her friends texted and went victoria's secret model who and she goes huh i know right like you disgusting human being you are not hiding this whatsoever this was always about attention for you always somebody said this adam levine situation is why i cannot support all women you knew you were having an affair with a married man and instead of apologizing to his wife privately you take it to tick-tock for sympathy for yourself yes and thank god the response has been what it is like it has been a white pill because honestly it has weirdly been a unifying moment for the internet everybody agrees here everybody agrees that the only victims here are biati and adam levine's kids they've also come to the same consensus that it does not matter if you are a stunning victorious secret model the ideal beauty standard whatever scumbag men who want to cheat will cheat but like i said earlier i don't want to take this opportunity just to you know bash men all over the place because that is what toxic feminists do because obviously not all men are like this and rather i would like to take the opportunity to say that my god we all have to do better you've got to do better like we live in a society in a culture where commitment is deemed old-fashioned and traditional and couples are divorcing after 5 or 10 or 15 years going i just want to work on myself like figure out who i am like why are you being so selfish you are throwing away a committed relationship years of love so if you can go screw around with people basically there have been so many celebrity breakups this year for that exact reason like i just want to try something new like no that's that's not how it works you freak and on top of that obviously we are still living in the midst of hookup culture where everybody is just sleeping around without trying to find any kind of meaningful connection objectively none of this is healthy this does nothing to better our culture and when we look at celebrities and they embody this toxic dumpster fire of a world that is what young people are learning so work on yourself set a better example we have to change course because this is not sustainable at all do you want to be the only person not

probably do that yeah because we're doing a lot of these we have not watched anything since I was forced to endure the movie Halloween which was very terrifying we are going to watch Lord of the Rings the first one right okay you know what the first one's called No The Hobbit no but that no the habit and Lord of the Rings are separate right but they're like in the same universe yeah the hobbit's a prequel to The Lord of the Rings I've never seen that but I have read The Hobbit I haven't read or seen any of the Lord of the Ring things except I know of Gollum so this is uh the Fellowship of the Ring Fellowship the Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring all right we are going to watch what he just said I'm also feeling very in the Christmas spirit because sheller's wife has decorated his entire house which you know she's a kindred spirit obviously she has the days until Christmas sign up she has all so I'm just feeling very at peace here I also heard that these movies are Christmasy because they come out in they came out uh around Christmas 2001 2002. 2003. yeah they were all a year apart I mean I'm not that old but I would have I thought before like 2015. oh man didn't like the Hobbit come out recently though The Hobbit movies came out like 2013 2000 okay that's what I'm thinking of I had no idea they were any different anyway let's go ahead and get started I've literally never seen this before let's do it do you like my matching by the way how fun so by the way okay because I know that if we were to watch these movies and if we were to watch the theatrical editions we would get shellacked in the comment section for not watching the extended Cuts so of course we're watching the extended Cuts I don't know what theatrical versus extended me but I'm happy to be here well they're just they're already long movies and this makes it how long is this I think Fellowship is what Fellowship of the Ring is 228 minutes was that what is that in hours three hours and 20 minutes well where do we get to the third one the third one is 263 minutes but it's so good it's worth every one of those minutes why don't they split them up like they did with them they did split them up three movies I mean mean like um why am I blanking out oh um gone with wind oh like I have an intermission yeah well technically each movie is two discs so when you take the first disc out that's like your intermission okay yeah that's when I go take a lap that's when you yes all right let me go pee let's go do it cool and on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth oh what was the budget for this in like 2000 forgot how much these movies cost I used to know all this stuff [Music] the ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life I think you should leave the ring behind the mom that's a meme foreign [Music] oh you get corrupted or something I gave you the chance of it willingly with you and elected a way of pay foreign close to him they hate water uh 20 miles I was like they're so close that's the director the drunk guy that's funny he makes an appearance in all three of them like Tarantino doesn't show up in most of us yeah

dirty Avatar welcome to Rivendell you see The Matrix the bad guy in The Matrix foreign [Music] land out of all the places that they've shown so far this is the prettiest yeah or those first like hills with a mountain behind the hills with mountains behind yeah when they were leaving the Shire oh yes it's like Billy Ray Cyrus am I wrong Sean Bean looks like Billy rayson in that moment we are here on common purpose Billy Ray Cyrus it's the hair of the wispies kind of blockhead s that's a meme too that one picture One does not simply that's the name One does not simply walk into Mordor it's black Gates so did you think that the meme look like Billy Ray I guess sort of crazy that's it right there there's no mere Ranger [Music] Peter Jackson was like okay cut we're not let's move on I won't be dead before I see the ring in the hands of my mouth dwarves are racist that's like open systemic racism wow wow cancel Fellowship of the Rings okay yeah Fellowship of the Ring yeah singular [Music] [Music] the nerd it is hardly possible to separate you even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not look at this one shot not this one but the next one [Music] just like miss you twist you shall be the Fellowship of the Ring it's so cheesy and that's the end of this disc okay guys we are taking a brief intermission because Lord of the Rings movies are long I have also been informed that I think this is the shortest one and that are there are longer ones in my future so go get a snack enjoy the break that's what I did I'm gonna go run and grab some Starbucks we're gonna come back and finish the rest of the movie and I don't know about you guys but I am actually sort of feeling like Bilbo Baggins and Gollum right now because I kind of need some precious gold in my life if you

movies so they're like all right we're gonna set out you see this Montage of them like literally walking hundreds of miles it was just a brief five minute walk that's the one thing the movie don't quite capture from the books is just how long things actually take because the books they're just like they're camping the whole time basically Miss Miniatures dude they're coming [Applause] that's unfortunate Frank Pippin always has to mess with [\u00a0__\u00a0] foreign I don't know how about your fruits you will see welcome Frodo of the Shire one who has high oh creepy [\u00a0__\u00a0] please

nice family they took the little ones where is Frodo I have to know captain waiting okay now he's just beating a suit for me or die being a simple gay love story you know back then the left tried to make photo and Sam the gay thing remember that back in the day they were like oh the later movies they get closer you know as friends but you can't have guy friends anymore yeah of course not they're

Homer yeah that was way back before and everything was political I remember reading an article and going oh that's dumb and then I moved on with my lives and here we are I'm glad you're with me all right it's kind of game she's like loves it with that hair [Laughter] named Kathy [Music] foreign oh oh a little tear no that'll be me um dude hey Sam big old man tears it's gonna be hard not to you gotta let it out sheller's Fellers you're gonna love it okay I just told each other this but and some of you guys might hate this this might be a controversial thing I think I like this better than Star Wars I would say that's a controversial take but at the same time it's understandable is it on brand for me I mean that like to be mean it really is like a they're both good and they're both great and so if if one were to be like I like the Lord of the Rings trilogy better than the Star Wars Trilogy I can't really fight them I understand why I don't hate the space thing about Star Wars I would just prefer it to be in like Middle Earth yeah than be in space I like the landscape I think it's aesthetically pleasing to watch yeah I like the diverse array of characters that are not aliens even though the Orcs or whatever they are are weird I like that it's a lot of like interesting people looking characters rather than like faceless robot alien yeah even though it's it's a fantasy it's it's still more relatable it still feels like I don't know like an Old English folk tale exactly and it feels like there's more human connection maybe that's just because it is more like human-like characters yeah okay like with Star Wars it Just Dance down into those like few core characters and this one I feel like there's so much like backstory and like yeah Gandalf you know all of his like weaving of all the stories and he's connected to all these different things probably because it goes on for millions and millions of years there's just so much context even I don't know but you feel it and how they've done it so that's cool I did have a problem with how they were just like trekking for days and like not eating or going to the bathroom or like it was a montage and suddenly they were I get that they have to do that for movies it just weirds me out because I'm like this is obvious you're glorifying something it's just not accurate but it's fine I mean that's just me being like a cynical nerd where it's like every time somebody tries to do an adaptation of a book I'm like well yeah I mean for the most part they do do a good job at adapting the book I would say Obviously you have to make changes because it's a movie yeah things don't translate but the thing that I don't think the trilogy ever really got the grasp of is just the the feeling of the Trek yeah the book it's just about how they're constantly walking moving through different Realms yeah and you you really get the sense of the passage of time this one the condensing just kind of makes it so you don't really get that sense and I think they were attempting to portray the passing of time with all of these like montages yeah yeah I think it would have been more effective if we were listening to scenes as they were walking going through those different things so it wasn't just like oh beautiful landscape and then checking through the snow or whatever then you would have more of an experience being with them camping Scavenging whatever they're gonna do because you only got to see that like whenever they were fighting or stopping or something like that I just think it would have yeah brought it to life a little more I think that's fair but um how you said that it feels more like you have more of a human connection to everyone it gets more there's even more emotional ties that happens in the uh was saying that at one of the movies I don't remember the name of it that he's going to be crying um well you're gonna be crying yeah I probably will be accurate everything I'm not upset about it this is the third one the third one always gets me I love it I can't wait we're gonna zoom in on that real close just like a single tier I'm I like this I'm excited to watch the other ones is long though I feel drained yeah this one the these are the extended Cuts so the pacing just to pack all the scenes and the pacing isn't quite the best but yeah the the third one is the longest one I can't wait that being said though I think that the pacing in the third one is a lot more Relentless than this one so you don't really feel you feel it but it's not as I feel like after they go through Moria and the Gandalf dies the pacing kind of takes a hit when they go to lothorian and they see galadrio I didn't really like that whole part with the elves it was really confusing because they were talking about like oh should they look into like one woman's eyes and then they never come out and then I was confused about whether it was like that woman or somebody else but then she was also weird and like had one of the Rings and was being all creepy people's brains so that was convoluted for me I'm sure there'll be more context to it at a later point I did like that at that point that's where the stuff who's the guy the Larry Cyrus that guy what's his character bormir I like that was kind of the switch for me that put it back in motion when his character started getting all like Manish basically in power hungry so that kind of ramped it up a bit but for the most part that just felt like killing time in a way yeah it kind of does feel like that it was so good they needed to be there but it just went happens in the book you gotta have that yeah so the so Galadriel the Kate Blanchett character that is who that's Kate Blanchett yes and that's who the new show follows that character okay the one that's on Amazon the prequel series and they turned her into this like feminist tough you know she's strong female she leads armies she takes down cave trolls by herself nice you know as one does yeah so I guess uh it sounds great we should watch those oh yeah we definitely should can't wait that'll be up next for sure yeah who's your favorite character um the man with the extended lifetime I don't know any of their names they're all confusing to me so Aragorn's got like three different names okay but his name's Aragorn Aragorn I like Aragorn he's my favorite I like Gandalf just because wise I feel like it gives me Dumbledore Vibes much better than double door you write oh my God so much better than the double door 100 least favorite I want to say the Orlando Bloom one but he kind of redeems himself and that he feels like a good character and he's like stagnant I feel like something interesting not stagnant but he's like has a solid presence so I feel like something will happen with him or not and then like three movies are gonna be like oh my God you really annoy me because he's really not a great actor I can't stand him controversial but I hate him really yeah the Kate Blanchard character I didn't like okay she's annoyed me and it confused me okay she's still too pale she's too white she's too white she's too white for you like albino they're just weird me out and it was confusing okay so what would you criticize about it though except for the uh Galadriel part that part confused then some of the passage of time there's some I mean it's it's very ahead of its time because it was made in the early early 2000s the movies yeah the books were written in the 50s I was impressed either there was not really too much that stood out to me as being like oh this is really dated like yeah it's clear they said millions millions of dollars on it I would like and maybe this is just because I have not read the books but some context with Gollum and Bilbo would be more helpful I think I picked it up because I don't lack brain cells so it made sense as like it went along to the beginning I was like okay how did he get I would have liked just some kind of in the Star Wars vein of like ooh and the potato and Once Upon a Time and galaxy far far away whatever that kind of thing I'm just giving some brief context or you know whatever because once Gollum was following and all that stuff then it made sense we got a bit of his backstory but at the beginning it was just like oh bill went and he got the ring from forgotten it was like well what was he doing out there getting the ring in the first place I was just I felt like some stuff it wasn't set up we gotta watch The Hobbit I know it shows that in The Hobbit but didn't The Hobbit movies come out later or maybe yes they did three movies oh my God we have so much to watch yeah well we're not gonna watch those though yeah all right yeah yeah that was great cool time for the next one let's do it right now Two Towers let's go we're out thanks for watching guys love doing these per usual we will be back for the next film which is the Lord of the Rings The Two Towers The Two Towers already

weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "IhVbu0kt81s": "what's up guys hello i think these are coming in now i was just taking a look at the chat as we had like the starting soon screen pulled up and the first thing that i saw is somebody saying imagine if we had shoes made of grass i don't know what i've gotten myself into here but hello friends oh my god i so any time that i'm like switching between screens or i'm pulling up the chat i don't know if you guys know i think i think i mentioned this in my last live but i do this little like like i do like a little sing-songy thing uh so much so that i think they might pull like some compilation of it or something so stay tuned for that but it's my filling the space sound and i realized i just did it there let's see okay so you guys have probably heard by now that congress is holding its first or just held its first hearing on ufos for the first time in 50 years first public hearing because i'm sure that they're talking about things behind closed doors that's what government does but anyway yesterday they held the first public hearing and everybody is mad about it literally everyone i on the other hand matt walsh also is super stoked about it because he loves this kind of stuff i just think it's interesting i'm just here for a good time to learn about our alien friends and then i went on twitter to try to you know see what the people were saying and everybody was freaking pissed off there was no good vibes anywhere and i get it because there's other things going on in the world but i was like guys we can we can laugh uh okay but i first wanted to read some of these quotes i have a cnn article pulled up i know cnn but some of the quotes in this are just too good like okay uh this is an indiana rep and he said for too long the stigma associated with uaps has gotten in the way of good intelligence analysis the stigma guys there's a stigma for everything uh pilots avoided reporting or laughed at when they did uh they are real and they need to be investigated which i mean i don't know maybe they are we're gonna learn guys if you have i should have said this at the beginning if you have stories if you have sightings if you have thoughts have theories send it in the chat superchat's easier it's where i usually i can see things but i will also try to look at the other chat as well um but like let me know because we're gonna dive deep this is gonna be a pretty interactive one today um there were also just like the people in this article were just so dramatic um where was this other quote there was another one oh there was another maybe this is the wrong article i had one pulled up and it was a it was like a compilation of a bunch of uh i think it was mostly dems i don't know but people on both sides of the political aisle being like super dramatic about this ufo hearing but anyway this is what i saw on twitter so i typed in ufo oop here we go see more see about four mass shootings occurred this weekend that we know of and women are about to lose abortion rights but congress let's hold up a hearing on ufos uh sightings there's more things so congress so then people on the right are also angry so congress is investigating ufo but not a stolen election um everybody is angry everybody this one the fact that uh congress is having hearings about the uh about ufos in the middle of a crisis says it all literally we're living in the midst of a crisis every single day i don't even know what specific crisis this person is talking about but yeah relatable um but i mean i i get that i understand i get similar comments when i talk about like celebrity news or that kind of thing things that are more cultural people will comment like with the amber heard stuff the amber heard johnny depp trial i've had some comments where people are saying why do we care why should we care none of this matters yeah it's a smaller you know thing in in the grand scope of you know what we're dealing with in the world right now i also i have an analysis on why i do think people should care about the johnny depp abraham trial i think it's part of a bigger cultural shift in regards to the metoo movement i actually have an article coming about coming out about that today so i will link it at some point actually might be dropping during this live where i explained that but all of that aside oh my god i just like hit like my the condensation i just flinged it anywhere sorry i got distracted anyway i get comments like that when i do more cultural things and i understand the criticism and sometimes i get fed up with the things that the government is focusing on but i think as viewers as people that are you know just taking in social media i think it's okay to laugh about this i think it's okay to say like all right well yeah let's see what see what the aliens are doing i don't know but they they decided to do this hearing in the guise of transparency was it who was it chiff at yes so and he's he's california he used to be um my producer and i both both used poo both used to live in the same california city outside of los angeles and uh he was one of our reps which is uh is his last name is it adam shifter or schiff schiff i wasn't sure if i had a t at the end but yeah adam schiff used to be a rep but anyway he was the one that brought this forth so he's a dem and they're doing it all for transparency which is kind of humorous because when have when is the fbi or the cia the dod the doj when if any of those agencies had any transparency with the american people never especially after 9 11 with the patriot act they're really just getting information on us and not sharing anything so we're living in a surveillance state so i'm guessing that they have information about ufos if they know everything about all of us so i don't think it's that big of a deal if they want to talk about it great so i was inclined to be more interested but then i was looking over some of the stuff that they you know found out they really didn't discover anything it was just them saying we've had sightings but then they didn't actually say what the sightings were they had a couple of very like blurry photographs but they they weren't actually transparent so it was a bit of a letdown but like i said one of these agencies actually been transparent uh i pulled up a couple of clips from the historic hearing on ufos that's the entire one which i don't obviously want to watch but here is a two minute recap that i thought we could all watch together before i do let me go over to this chat real quick um and see here we go if you're an alien you can tell us your chat can keep it a secret maybe i am i mean you guys do think that ben and i are the same person so maybe we are just one alien i don't know um should i make the grass shoes danny if you want to make the grass shoes i support that i would love to see what that ends up looking like and how that comes to be but you know what i support your creativity aliens are too afraid to invade us because they're afraid they'll get canceled for misgendering someone yeah honestly i like to think that our world is basically just reality tv for aliens i think that that that's kind of sad but at the same time i think that our government is basically reality television i think that the emperor johnny depp trial is basically reality television so i think basically we are just walking entertainment for aliens if they do exist um somebody says guys i have an exam tomorrow wish me luck good luck i just saw that at the corner of my eye but exams are rough so good luck anyway alrighty we're going back to the video two and a half minutes let's do it this is a cool intro are ufos real and if they are what are they today a congressional committee questioned leaders of our intelligence community hoping to learn more about unidentified flying objects spotted by pilots and other military personnel the only photo that i've seen come out of this trial military leaders now admit there are objects flying around out there that they can't explain i love local news that aliens are about to land on earth but instead our enemies have a technology that we don't understand they look like blinking triangles but what are they a u.s navy ship captured this video several years ago off our coast and a similar looking object was seen off the coast years later unidentified aerial phenomena are a potential national security threat and they need to be treated that way for the first time in more than 50 years a public congressional hearing was held on unidentified aerial phenomena the military's term for ufos uaps are unexpected it's true but they are real they need to be investigated and many threats they pose need to be mitigated it's hard to say just how many uaps have been seen because for years pilots and military personnel were afraid to tell others what they saw for too long the stigma associated with uaps has gotten in the way of good intelligence analysis pilots avoided reporting or were laughed at when they did but now times have changed and reporting is being encouraged to protect national security the intelligence community has a serious duty to our taxpayers to prevent potential adversaries such as china and russia from surprising us with unforeseen new technologies military leaders admit they're seeing an increasing number of unauthorized or united states in military control training areas ranges and other designated airspace like this video captured from a military jet i do okay all of this i'm gonna get back to this video all this does remind me i was sitting out in my garden you guys know that i have a very exciting life where i hang out on my patio with my plants and my dogs but i was sitting out there and i can see basically anywhere in nashville just because even though it's a bigger city we have a couple of airports and so anywhere that you are in nashville you can like sort of like they'll be planes flying over um so i was sitting there and i was you know watching the chem trails it was like twilight and i saw some weird blinky things and for a second i was like is that a ufo because definitely didn't look like a star i was sitting out there my dad used to we used to look at constellations together and so i was sort of looking for those and i kept seeing this blinking thing and it was moving around and my first thought was is this a ufo so maybe that's just me being a psychic again and i just thought this hearing into existence because i like to think that i you know causing all of this of course with my psychic abilities but anyway it just reminds me of that because i did see that blinking thing and i literally texted a friend and i was like did i just see a ufo i probably didn't i don't know but you know what there have been weirder things right back to the video explanation for what this this specific object is federal leaders made these hearings public to show transparency and maintain trust but they added that sensitive intelligence information still needs to be protected so some things were discussed later in a closed session as for those blinking triangles after years of analysis the military now believes they're drones but they still don't know who was flying them or why steve price cbs 8 yeah so it's a oh my god who is that yeah so it is a hearing to promote transparency but there are some things that the american people just can't know must protect them must have silence that's what you guys have to say oh wait before we do that i wanted to look at the comments on these these were good they know exactly what it is and what these drones are actually capable of these extraterrestrials i can't even speak right uh these extraterrestrials are not just bedtime stories or myths and legends created by parents and conspiracy theorists they are quite real and out there let's see my uncle when he was in his laters later years told the family that when he was in the military that in colorado his unit had to go pick up a downed ufo that had crashed to the ground also they were uh briefed not to ever speak of this and we when he told us and when he told us he said what they're going to do to me now that i am old he also told us many details about it that's interesting now i want to hear the details i should text my brother my brother was in the air force i wonder if he knows anything i'm literally going to text him right now um let's see i'm gonna go i'm gonna go back to the chat in a second but watch i'm literally okay chase did you ever hear anything about ufos in the airport i should have texted him earlier uh okay we'll see um uh all right this they need to come to my little small town here in southeast georgia me and my friends watch these flying orbs all the time for the past few years we go to the middle of a field in the pitch dark and these things come and put on a show for us seriously ufo or ua app enthusiasts come to meadow georgia and watch the show all right guys you heard it here first meadow georgia well if it's in all right southeast georgia that's not really close to nashville georgia is semi-close i mean we touched the states touch each other so maybe maybe i was seeing a ufo because if you could see it in southeast georgia you could probably see it in asheville maybe so maybe i was seeing ufos look online for a paper titled migrating extraterrestrial civilizations in interstellar colonies colonel oh my god colonization implications for seti and seta it discusses how and why extraterrestrials may travel from their home worlds to the solar system my gosh i have so much to learn this is like a whole new world that i have not even been involved with humanity is a comedy show to aliens this person gets it we are a reality show um good way to feed it to us a little at a time well played i don't want it a little bit at a time i would rather be bombarded with the information and know what i'm dealing with i'm already basically a prepper for biden's apocalypse i might as well start prepping for an alien you know invasion as well just add to my i don't know what i would add to my you know like go bag and preparedness stuff to protect myself from an alien um okay i'll go back to the chat now so i got distracted um let's see [Music] this is not uh in relation to this but hey brad do you or anyone else in the daily wire ever plan to run for office i can't speak for anybody else i do not think that i would ever run for office if i did it would probably be me doing something with like a local school board or something in local or state politics uh i have a bunch of people that are like you know with any kind of political commentator people will be like oh are you gonna like run for president like no no never i would rather drag myself over hot coals than the in the federal government could never do it never speaking of aliens have you ever seen the movie called they live you might enjoy it no but i have not seen most movies if you've been following me for a bit you know the fact that even though i was an actor and i comment on culture and entertainment i have not seen most films i was not allowed to watch tv or most movies when i was growing up we didn't even have a television i wasn't allowed to play video games either um what it is all right my producer who is a movie buff says it's a great movie so maybe i'll watch it um let's see so yeah i haven't seen most things so if you guys send me recommendations most likely my producer over here aka what you guys call sound guy we'll know what it is and i won't let's see i can't believe what happened uh this weekend was in my state and on my birthday my thoughts and prayers go out to everybody in buffalo and new york yes absolutely um it was a uh absolutely horrific tragedy and it's a shame that as with any uh sorry of people coming in as as with any tragedy it immediately becomes politicized and the media takes it and runs with it in a way that completely detaches the story from the people involved and it feels like they're just using those people's stories for their own you know political gain and grabs so but anyway uh yes my thoughts and prayers as well and i'm sorry that that was on your birthday um it's always hard when these types of things fall on days where we should be you know celebrating and happy let's see uh the daily wire disco discord or cooper trooper's discord please i used to use discord all the time in college that was kind of like how all of our clubs and everything you communicated but that was overwhelming even for that so i have not thought about doing one for uh this group of folks but i think would be fun hi james you're late what have you missed uh basically watching a video about ufos based on the hearing from yesterday we read a bit of a cnn article a couple of quotes from cnn article but really we're just talking about ufos and i did text my brother who was in the military to see if he has any information that he's never told me so we'll see if i get a response let me check nothing yet he says lol no why he's unboozed he probably means he knows something he's not gonna tell me um okay i had i think that was all i wanted to do on that one did you guys see i also pulled this up this was last week but nasa is launching naked pictures of humans into space in hopes of attracting aliens so we have congress that is worried about aliens and ufos and they're saying this is a national security threat we need transparency probably just because they want to you know tax people more to start initiatives to protect us from aliens meanwhile nasa's like yeah come on like we'll send some only fans people up into the sky come on down like we're living in clown world here we go uh the depictions will also like how how is this real nasa scientists plan to launch pictures of naked humans into space in the hope of luring aliens to us the depictions will also include an invitation to respond should an intelligent alien race find the space news oh fortunately the hypo hypothetical alien shouldn't be too shocked by the unsolicited nudes what the pictures aren't graphic photographs of naked humans but a drawing of a naked man and woman next to a depiction of dna okay the man and woman are waving in an attempt to look more inviting what nasa scientists revealed that the image revealed the image in a study that's part of the project called the beacon in the galaxy okay so they're trying see we everybody needs to get on the same page with oh here it is oh hello that is the picture yeah it's not that graphic what is this binary why are we now talking about binaries binary is the simplest form of mathematics as it involves only two opposing states zero and one yes or no black or white mass and empty space oh oh so they're wanting to show this is actually funny they're trying to show a man and a woman because you know binary black white man woman whatever because that is likely universal across all intelligence so scientists in this study are saying that a binary construct is a universal across all intelligence and meanwhile we have people down here on this earth saying that non-binary people exist the gender is not real that sex is not real again the through line of this live right now feels like everybody needs to get on the same freaking page about binaries about aliens about whether we are attracting them getting rid of them somebody tell me something um that's just a ufo uh let's see the concept of sending depictions of naked humans to space isn't new they did this before my gosh the plaques are attached to antennas on the crafts they're still sailing away from earth to this day can you imagine you're like oh yeah i drew some nudes one time and there's just still out there in space i wonder if any aliens have seen them what a world what a world um okay i'll go back to this chat now let's see i prefer to call him the audio libra who was that in reference to ben i wasn't listening um good afternoon miss cooper are you surviving this tennessee humidity okay and a tip of the hat to elon musk for taking the red pill uh yes i am surviving the humidity okay my hair is about to start sticking to the back of my neck in a more aggressive fashion but i lived in the south for 10 years prior to coming back so i'm used to it although this will be the first time that i have longer hair uh i think some photos are on the internet of this but for most of my childhood i had what i would call a pumpkin haircut i had a bob with bangs and it literally looks like i had a pumpkin on my head but it was like boop it was super cute when i was younger but i grew out of it and i kept it for way too long but i had bangs and a little like bob and so that was good because it got it off my neck and i just didn't really feel it but now i have longer hair and i am worried about the ramifications of having that i'm not going to chop off my hair again because if you've seen those photos it was it was a terrible look for me uh so we'll not be going back to that but as of now yes i am surviving the humidity uh just yeah baby powder folks if there's one thing that i can offer you as a southerner about how to get through summers it is baby powder it's good for the humidity and the sweat i can't believe i'm talking about that i love how the taxpayers are paying to send alien pictures of their trunk what's what's new we already pay for some ridiculous stuff if you guys didn't know every year rand paul puts out a i mean it's hundreds of pages but it it's basically disclosing at the end of the year everything that taxpayers have funded and it'll be things like you know like the like the new uh pelotons for all of the congressional staffers that kind of thing like that'll be in there new like special office chairs for like three people but it was like three thousand dollars for three office chairs what was there were there was some with animals like weird studies that they did on like bugs or like it's always they he also writes about all the weird studies that taxpayers have funded that don't really mean anything oh it was like one they were giving drugs to some kind of rodent just for you know shits and giggles basically to see what happens we pay for some weird stuff if you guys have seen that you know that it's a good time um let's see somebody said you should react to the videos of you singing and theater stuff i might could be coming soon though actually that was brought to my attention earlier today that i should do that in a meeting with my team so it's gonna be embarrassing and it's not gonna be embarrassing like everybody does embarrassing stuff but i'm i'm it's gonna be fun yeah shall we my producer's saying it's gonna be fun i'm gonna be like in a corner in my chair worried about it let's see hey in one of your vids the jordan peterson fat gate i think you have a leather bomber jacket on i'm looking to get one for my fiance what brand is it i'm pretty sure it is zara i don't know i i think it's zara i think most of the stuff that i get is there see carl says uh tbh if aliens are out there they probably view us like we view uncontacted tribes in southeast asia fascinating to study from a distance but we are not getting near them and they aren't getting near us that makes sense yeah i don't really know anything about the uncontacted tribes in southeast asia but again yes would be interesting to know what i want to go but i actually i would i would go see what happens so who knows uh need a tip jar a tip jar for everything alex jones is apparently right on yeah you know you can give alex jones crap for the way that he delivers things and the way that he you know sums up some of his conspiracy theories and all of that like frogs are turning like gay or whatever not actually turning gay but basically what he was saying was right about what they were doing in the studies they were doing he predicted that there was going to be a war and he was this fall he predicted that there's going to be a war in march suddenly ukraine is happening so yeah you can laugh at him all you want but when you boil down what he's saying there's a lot of it that there's some truth there um at another video this was i haven't seen this one my producer sent it to me and said that i should react to it and watch it with you guys um it's been 21 years since mysterious lights hovered over phoenix this is just ufo content um and this is okay it's called the phoenix lights i've never even heard of the phoenix lights do you guys know what this is this was in 2018. oh there's some good comments here okay all right here we go let's watch this mysteries of our time at least here in arizona today marking 21 years since the phoenix lights first appeared in the sky to this day nobody really knows what they were or where they came from it's been that long huh this weekend you can relive the phenomenon with a documentary airing right here in the valley lina is over at the harkins shape 14 at scottsdale road and shea with your preview of a mystery people are still curious about the truth is out there you guys do you guys remember this do you remember the flood of phone calls coming into the newsroom what is that there's something in the sky and everyone's saying me last week in my garden maybe it's sky harbor maybe it's something else so this is uh where we can get at least some of the answers uh this weekend so here at arkansas i'm here with dr lynn this full screen and tell me about what people can expect when they come here i imagine a lot of people are saying are you thinking what i'm thinking actually i stayed anonymous for seven years as a medical doctor before i came forward and we're so excited because now we have the data this is 21 years of studying the data and it still cannot be explained or denied and we're so thrilled that hark and shea will and will be hosting an event that's so weird only mainstream that's so weird where we show the documentary or internationally award-winning documentary guys should i live react to that documentary should we do a live or i watch that rangers who are going to creep me out studying these things as well as zuni elder who talks about the native american connection that's a that's really profound and amazing um travis walton if you remember the movie well yeah fire in the sky that's another one i'm not even listening to what they're saying i'm just looking at the video and uh councilwoman francis barwood who was the only elected official who came forward to ask for a reenactment which happened three years after the mass citing three air national guards tried to reenact the phoenix lights and failed and also we have this one wonderful doctor who also an md who also stayed anonymous for 21 years the first time that we're going to hear from him about his experience absolutely he was with his family coming up from tucson to phoenix and it was right over their car for some time and the amazing thing too is that the dod just came forward in december a new york new york times article uh divulged that harry reid actually requested a study they are studying it now at the pentagon um and but of course they're not going to tell us about it transparency just like myself i mean i don't know what these things were but they know that they are and they're far advanced from what we have so i know you've done a lot of talking about this and you've met a lot of people who saw it and and what is the consensus among people who actually looked inside what are most people saying actually there has not been one report and this is important of harm threat or abduction associated with the phoenix lights phenomenon they were absolutely anomalous even our past former governor symington who mocked the sighting in 97 came forward after the 10th anniversary to reveal bravely that he actually saw one of these mile wide craft and larger and that it was otherworldly and he's a pilot in award-winning air force definitely an officer and many many people saw this it was massive and the technology was far advanced it was huge if you were here you remember it and you remember the next day everyone was talking about did you see that did you see that last night well if you didn't see it or you went okay oh that's all now she's just gonna do a pitch for the documentary i think two people in the comments said my wife and i lived in tempe uh it's a tempeh or tempe i think it's tempe looking down on the phoenix valley in 97 and we witnessed the phoenix phoenix lights with all of our neighbors i'm an engineer my neighbors were engineers and pilots we instantly saw the lights in the sky north of downtown we watched for nearly 20 minutes until the lights drifted out of sight to the south we knew without a death we were witnessing something that was not oh available was not available technology or not or natural phenomena we call the police luke field the airport nothing no follow-up it's nice to see the government finally waking up and publicly admitting something is going on let's see if only someone had a massive spotlight to see the shape let's see what people said um i love how they just joke like it's some small thing but it isn't yeah i mean i'm sitting here joking but if this is real then yeah we should be talking about it and learning about it and it shouldn't just be behind closed doors i don't trust anything that the government says like the american people like can't know and they need to be you know we need to have a private whatever i'm like come on you're saying nothing in your public hearings all the good stuff is behind closed doors um thousands of people reported seeing the lights including one general aviation pilot that one pilot kurt russell really i didn't know kurt russell was a pilot but i don't know about that that's kind of cool that's fun i wonder if kurt russell was in the documentary um somebody said i saw this in southern colorado the same year as phoenix lights wait somebody on uh the other video we uh we watched was talking about colorado this is just fascinating what is that thing in um is it in nevada area isn't that doesn't have to do with some kind of yeah i think i need to take a field trip now guys i'm gonna get a bus and what oh there was that show called roswell too that actually is something that i've seen i've seen part of the show roswell i feel like that fits in there with psych though is that a homeschool show all my homeschool friends liked roswell if you guys know from last week uh i revealed that everybody on our team who was homeschooled loves the show psych and so it's been determined that psych is apparently a homeschool show um i'll go back to these comments see what you guys are saying um see there we go there's another there's another sing-songy thing i told you guys there's so many um hey i love the comment section you definitely got a male interested in politics too but won't try the skincare though from the netherlands hey it's all it's all good um mimi's actually they were so nice they sent me a whole new package today and a really nice bottle of wine it was very nice um but i love working with them i did convince my editor i talked about it last week i got him to move on from his bar of soap to that's what he uses to wash his face and he was joking with me earlier and he was like you exposed me to the whole world i was like yeah you should be because you need to up your skincare game but he is going to use nimmy now so i converted one mail i'm winning let's see um aliens watch us like a reality tv show like in south park is that a south park thing i've also never seen south park so um i watch clips of it and i know that it's relevant but i have not sat down to actually watch like you know full uh episodes or seasons or whatever if the government is talking about ufos i can safely put away any conspiracy that aliens exist the government would not want any of us to know interesting okay that's an interesting take what do you guys think about that um let's see a little off topic i'm sorry i would like to know what you think about libertarianism anarcho-capitalism in the austrian school of economics um i would say i so i am more libertarian leaning i'm definitely not like a big l libertarian uh but when it comes to the economy i definitely i love the austrian thinkers um and i do think one of my big qualms with the gop and with modern conservatives is that we we can talk all the time about the left and democrats spending money but we spend just as much just on different things and so if we want to talk about limited government we have to hold our own side accountable um so while socially i'm more conservative um fiscally i think that the gop conservatives that we have some work to do and that modern conservatives need to read some austrian economics so anyway um anarcho-capitalism i have a lot of great friends so i used to work at fee which is the foundation for economic education uh it is the longest running and probably most well-respected um like libertarian think tank and it's all about um economics and so i used to be a writer for them and so i've written a lot about economics and about austrian economics so as a result there's a lot of people there that are antarctica capitalists who i love and respect i'm definitely not one but i understand where they come from and their you know vision for the world um not for me and i don't really think that in you know our modern times and you know current culture cultural attitudes that that would really be plausible but i can understand where they're coming from so that's a long-winded answer uh you are a smart girl with good knees thank you popped the knee up today um i've always looked through comments so this is a perfect show for the time you're in you have really good takes and i honestly don't think you look like then that's a hot take um people often ask like how many times do you get told that you look like ben and it's like it's every day it's like tweets dms comments all of it and i promise i do have videos with ben they're somewhere on the internet so we're not the same person are we though maybe we're just aliens no uh we're not at some point we'll we'll do something together soon and we will prove we'll do a test of how much we actually look like but the fact that both of his parents met me and went oh my god you're the girl before they like walked up to me not even knowing like i wasn't even being introduced to them it walked up to me and were like oh my god you're the girl that looks like ben i see it and i was like well there's no going back now um let's see um there we go i did i did the sing-songy thing again my producer's laughing happens every time i live in salt lake once saw a glowing white orb fly down out of the sky from the mountains and then swoop back up towards the sky into the clouds like a nike swoosh moved incredibly fast yeah if anybody has any other stories put them in here that's wild mike what do you think about elon musk voting republican next election what he said about the dems i think it's epic uh the amount of red pilling that's happening right now is incredible have you guys seen what jeff bezos has been tweeting like biden is so bad that jeff bezos even got in and was talking about inflation and how we're just printing obscene amounts of money and pumping it into the economy and how that's detrimental like yeah it is um so it's wild there's a lot of people waking up or maybe they've already been like with jeff bezos maybe he's already been awake but now he's actually just vocalizing things but i'm seeing a lot of people make the transition over and elon is absolutely right with the things that he's been saying about the democrats i mean they're cannot be trusted they've moved so so far left um we are not in the time of the blue-collar democrats anymore they are not the party of the working class they are the party of the elites they are the party of extreme progressive ideologies um not jfk democrats anymore let's see just say aliens are pro-life all the leaks will start coming through that was good james uh the leftists probably already scared away the aliens because they're afraid of a species that aren't grounded by common sense that's funny all right here's a theory have you i've done a comment section episode on this you guys know demi lovato's uh alien show i think you probably have all by now seen the clip where she sang skyscraper to the star person because the star person had drama with men and so she was like don't worry like she made all the men leave the room and was like i have trauma with men too so i'll sing skyscraper and then it was like beefing at her i was like me me me we went and she was like oh my god i got a standing ovation from an alien i was like woman no this box is beeping at you she also then later said in an interview i was about to say it was with drew barrymore but i don't think it was it was some like entertainment tonight thing and she said she would date an alien so there was also lips of tick tock posted do you guys see that picture where it was like um it was her before and after photo of what she's looking like now it's like i don't even want to make fun of her because she like demi lovato is going through something i mean we all know like she has they she's they now ah she's the woman there's no going around non-binary no um she's attempted suicide multiple times she's been in rehab she has awful struggles with addiction if you know any of her you know family story she has an incredibly troubled family and all these people just enable her behavior she does not have good friends if they're letting her wander around singing to aliens living in a fantasy world with star people wanting to date aliens um anyway so but yeah she's not looking that great there's some before and after photos of her out there right now but let's see if aliens saw the pics on hunter biden's laptop and left yeah i would too i would too i studied okay here's going to carl says i studied astrobiology in college so i'm a junkie for this stuff the tech required to traverse interstellar distances is staggering so if they come here it's for a reason google dark forest theory you write that down i don't know if i wanna look dark oh yeah i need to actually look up all the things wait sheller has a running list of the things you guys tell me to look up that i he's my scribe uh dark forest theory that seems sketchy i don't want to look at that alone why are there over 90 of you why are over 90 of ufos in the u.s only do the people or the governments or other governments not care like we do that i did not know that that was a number or that that was a stat but now see now that could be a conspiracy is it our government putting things in the sky as a distraction this is all this is all a game of distraction to be take us away from the world economic forum bringing globalism to america this is all a distraction guys no i don't know that is interesting um maybe they're not paying attention maybe their governments don't care china has bigger things to be concerned about like taking us over so they probably don't care uh somebody says i'll run the bus let's go heck yeah if you want to do it come come join we'll go we'll go to area 51. um let's see assuming you're a person to faith how does believing in aliens align with believing in a creator who made us in his image i am not a practicing christian i'm not a person of practicing faith so i'm not sure but other people in the comments that want to answer that uh would be happy to discuss and hear about it uh look up bob lazar on your free time he was hired to reverse engineer ufo aircraft in the late 1980s he exposed area 51 and predicted the existence of element 115. you all know all of this stuff this is wild really this is in the 1980s this has been around since then it was crazy hey red have you seen you guys are brilliant what is this uh have you seen all of nasa's posts about meteors flying by earth and some expected to hit soon what are your thoughts i did see one where it said like it wasn't at a meteor the size of like the um empire state building or something like that i should i be paying attention to that more i see it and i go i think my response to that is like well if it hits us i can't stop it i feel like with political things i can at least try to move the needle a bit i can vote i can have this show i can you know talk to people but if a meteor's coming i'm not a astrophysicist i can't do anything i've got my you know preparedness stuff my prepper kit so if it hits and like there's chaos in the world maybe i'll try to survive for a bit but it's kind of like listen take me out i guess take me out to the ballgame no i have no idea what i would do so if you guys think that i should be paying more attention to that or if there's something i can do in that scenario let me know um from a teen girl thank you so much for being a strong female role model they're kind of hard to come by these days i really appreciate that um thank you i will say it is hard um most of the people that i looked up to ooh um growing up and even just like that i still look up to it's very it is difficult to find because it's hard it's difficult to find strong women that are not like crazy radical lefty feminists um like women that are empowered or whatever and so as a result i would often just like the people that i would look up to or that i would try to emulate were like women in classic literature in books because people that i would like the characters that i would see on tv or in movies or you know celebrities and that kind of thing it was always like why would i ever want to emulate what you're doing like your takes are terrible your behavior is abhorrent you're walking around like trash you're not that intelligent so really it was my mom and people in classic literature were the women that i really looked up to so anyway i really appreciate that thank you let's see most likely the government can't do anything so they don't want to acknowledge it yeah well they're all incompetent so yeah if anything is gonna if anyone is going to be able to do anything about it that is the strength to do anything about it it's the countries that i don't know if we want them interacting with aliens in the first place let's see people oh ufos people how do we get funding for all of this me you don't actually think they spend twenty thousand dollars on a hammer thirty thousand dollars on a toilet seat that's good yeah i mean that's sort of what i was alluding to when i was talking about uh rand paul's document that he releases when we see like the abhorrent amount of money that they spend on random stuff it's like really are you actually spending that much money on a chair or are you just funneling it's there it's like blm with her uh patrice colors paying her baby daddy you know wasn't it almost a million dollars and everybody else in her family like really you were you were were you funneling some money through something so anyway you guys should look that up also uh we have um candace did a incredible documentary on george floyd and blm that's coming out next week if you're interested in that kind of stuff get prepped for that it'll be on daily wire it's exclusive for daily wire members so if you're not a member already make sure to go subscribe and if you are an all access member i do smaller live similar to this but it's more like question and answer oriented and i get into some of the deeper stuff so anyway that's my plug for today but if you're interested in the blm stuff we have something cool coming let's see i have an alien story in 2000 i was born okay here we go do you have any uh information you would like to tell us about being an alien mr random do you follow any sports only ufc for me lately no not really i used to follow basketball my mom loves basketball um specifically because i get a lot of hate from this for this people would say like oh you only like the warriors because they were winning like when they were on their like me really like their mean streak in like 2017 2018 like that whole period when they were like really on fire um people would be like you only like them because they're winning but my family did live in oakland for a long time before i was born so my mom liked warriors then and then steph curry actually went to the college my parents went to so i saw him play for the first time when he was like a little scrawny sophomore he came and played um he went to davidson and davidson was playing against ut chattanooga and so i think i saw him play there for the first time and then we would go to davidson all the time so i've had a long allegiance to steph curry which actually wholesome story because i love academia and higher education steph left in his junior year to go uh play for the warriors so he never actually graduated but during covid he started going back to school and he actually just got his diploma and walked he went to the ceremony and he walked in dc just a couple of days ago which is super wholesome like he actually wouldn't got his uh degree but anyway so i used to fault this long-winded but i used to follow basketball i used to sort of follow tennis i've been to the u.s open um and so i like tennis but i really don't i don't have the time to really get into many sports you guys know i follow horse racing and that kind of thing makes me cry but i will go to it here's the thing i will go to a sporting event and i will become the most engaged competitive person i will not know what team it is but i will pick one and i will go ham and then after that i won't think about it again and i won't follow what that team is doing so i have no allegiance but put me at a game and i will lose my mind uh anyway there we go let's see i can offer a better explanation is there somewhere to send it that isn't chat super chats are expensive well you could have said it in this chat you just sent me a super chat you would have that one uh my dms are really hard to keep track of but i try to at least like once we go through and so if you send me any uh um alien stories maybe i'll catch them when i go through later this week and see so i tried to go through a little bit like people will send me things and they're like comment section idea so just like click on those in case any of you guys send me any crazy reels and i have used some of them i have used a lot of those in segments but that's probably the better way to send it let's see i've been enjoying your commentary since i was introduced to your channel it's nice seeing a young person with objective reasoning i'm an x-file trust no one agent cooper that's it thank you so much troy i really appreciate it uh if you don't mind me asking are you an atheist no i wouldn't say that i am an atheist i'm probably more agnostic i was raised um kind of in and out of the christian church my dad is episcopalian and my mom was pretty non-denominational but um none of us we were we weren't raised in a specific church and she really allowed my brothers and i to kind of determine our own path one of my older brothers uh got really interested in buddhism and that kind of thing and then my other brother and i just sort of have floated around but i have been going to church pretty regularly here in nashville um with people that i work with and i think that it's a wonderful way to start my week but i'm not practicing by any means so if you are asking me about anything like biblical and that kind of thing not really something that i can answer with much authority um but no not 100 atheist i just don't know at this point let's see have you seen what stephen crowder said about horse girls yes people posted it in my reddit thread like two times today too also if you guys don't know there's a reddit thread i did not start it i'm not engaged in it at all but i do go and check it because at some point i'm going to do a meme review of the the epic memes that you guys have done because some of them are super funny but a couple people posted them in there but yeah stephen crowder went on a rant today with his guest about horse girls and how crazy we are i'm trying to decide if i should do a response video to him and start some beef should i a defense i will do a dissertation my defense of horse girlism in opposition of stephen crowder's comments something like that let me know your thoughts let's see uh you should play red dead redemption 2 horoscape somebody else said that before i don't i don't really play video games but we are going to start doing we have to set up all the equipment but i am hopefully going to be doing live streams where i am playing video games and you guys see me struggle through learning how to play them so if it is a horse game if it actually is a horse game if you're not tricking me into playing some horror game maybe i'll actually do it because i'm scared i will not do that but i will play a horse game if you could only eat one kind of food for the rest of your life what would it be i'd probably go with burgers or barbecue uh i would probably go with steak and if you want steak let me go into my seamless plug if you want steak you guys should try good ranchers and you can use code cooper for 30 off of your order there's my you guys like my ad reads so there was one for you but no probably steak uh also a big fan of pork like pork chops not kind of thing so probably either of those and then my comfort dish see i see i can't just pick one i see i don't love pasta enough to only eat pasta for my entire life but like my death row like meal or like my last meal would probably either be steak or like a spicy vodka sauce pasta something like that with bacon in it lots of bacon cause pork obviously uh let's see but burgers and barbecue great answer you're awesome these live shows are my favorite things to watch i support all that you've commented on in this section huh title fun that was good matthew you do what you're doing thank you so much i really appreciate it i'm glad you guys like the lives i was very i was really nervous about starting to do them i think just because it's like comment section it's not really written by any means like i know what i want to talk about but we still have like it's edited and we do all of our jump cuts and that kind of thing and doing the live just felt like i was losing a lot of control but i've actually really enjoyed figuring out how to do them and now that we have a better system in place so that my producer isn't losing his mind every time then i was actually on time today wow oh nobody acknowledged that guys you make fun of me for being late every time today i was on time we were actually sitting here getting everything set up we come in like 30 minutes early to troubleshoot things and it was set up so quickly that we were all sitting around and it was like something's gonna go wrong but i think we've done it it's now been like two months and it actually is working out let's see hey talking about aliens did you see the she-hulk trailer is that a movie coming out that's weird that's strange but i also i can't really say that that's weird with any authority because i've never i don't think i've ever watched a hulk movie i'm very i'm not well versed in the marvel universe at all i've maybe seen a couple like two of the films i did watch doctor strange the new one and i watched the other doctor strange i have also seen what's the one with groot guardians of the galaxy uh that might be it y'all looks pretty terrible it does maybe i'll watch it for how bad it'll be well maybe i'll watch on a live stream i'll rip it and watch it i don't know but anyway i have not seen um i have not seen the trailer but maybe i maybe i will somebody said would you go to mass with matt and michael yeah absolutely i've been to mass before my uh best friend in the whole world is catholic um and so yeah i would absolutely go with them i'm not against it by any means uh like i said i've been going to church pretty regularly so i think it would be very interesting somebody said nah i grew up on earth from not very alieny oh that was mr random that was the one who was talking about uh his alien stories being born um let's see oh here we go nah best horse game currently is legend of zelda breath of the wild you can feed the horse apples and carrots and give her a better kit here we go guys the one video game that i have played all the way through is legend of zelda ocarina of time and the only reason i was like actually allowed to play it my brother was taking like a gap year i don't know what we were doing at home all summer but it was some summer in chattanooga my brother was taking a gap year before he went to college he was transferring schools and he took a year in between schools and he got an xbox somehow he had gotten an xbox i think at college when he left and he was finally able to get one because my mom didn't allow us to have video games he brought it back i think that's how it happened he was like let's play this so i did play legend of zelda ocarina of time all the way through that is my one experience with video games other than like i always say the sean white snowboarding game so i already sort of know the legend of zelda you know world shindig even though it was a long time ago so if you're saying that there's horses in that i could be down um i don't know that would actually be a fun to start with somebody i saw in one of the in the regular chat somebody said you would get owned in the cod something and that's just terrifying to me all of those like all of the games where there's such a huge fandom and all of the like gamer dudes are so intense about it i will match their intensity i will be so bad but i will match the intensity for your own entertainment um let's see okay i'm gonna go back to this okay this is just this is so so off topic but i did just i pulled it up a second ago i just forgot because i got distracted jeff bezos like i said has had some base to takes but today he said he tweeted the weirdest thing uh this is the dogecoin um guy here but he says how to create more democrats be republican and ask like act like an to moderate and how to create more republicans be democrat and act like an to moderates pro tip maybe align your actions with your goals um pretty good point there but he says scene you'd refer to yourself as a poster but maybe you're mostly just a wise poster there you go jeff bezos stepping in um and then this random account tweets at him and says can you invite billy and i onto your yacht with lar and i'm trying to see that fine piece of ass in person and jeff bezos responds to this random guy and says thank you i've been working hard on my ass what is jeff bezos doing all the time these billionaires elon and bezos are just sitting around sending out fire tweets do you guys see when perag was going off about how like no we don't have a problem with bots like in spam accounts like that's not real we we have this all figured out and elon just put like the poop emoji in that kind of thing he's really been on like the emoji thing when the uh project veritas um guys exposed the twitter employee who was you know saying oh he's just some dude with like where comey is f and um yeah they said like where kami is f and elon is just some like insane person with asperger's he's like they literally said that because he has asperger's that he's like special needs and is crazy which is an awful thing to say and elon just like put like a sad face emoji he's really just leaning into the quick responses but i'm living for all of his tweets right now i think tomorrow we're going to talk about him do a deep dive into everything that's been going on with elon so get stoked for that but anyway that's literally all that i wanted to show you because if you hadn't seen this does not have enough likes and you should like this for jeff people are going to see that pop up on my feed they're gonna be like brett why did you like it listen good for him he's hitting the gym we can all i we did the jordan peterson episode yesterday where the person you know talking about sports illustrated well they had that girl on the cover who again i wouldn't say she's ugly but it's just weird that sports illustrated put somebody you know actually lauren chen made a good point i think it was lauren and she was saying god how did she put it she said people people are saying that this is like the normal body type that we need to accept it because you know this is this is the real body this is like this is health or whatever and she made a good point and she said just because like the majority of people in america are like somewhat overweight and like might have this you know body type does not mean that it's healthy just because there are so many people that are overweight that does not suddenly make it that this has to be normal and has to be healthy um so i think that was a good point to make but anyway we did we were just talking about that whole situation sports illustrated so good for jeff for encouraging all of us to hit the gym so maybe maybe this is a good comment uh popping back over here to this chat let's see okay would you consider doing interviews on your show yes we're gonna try to do some more soon um i had my other producer kobe who you all loved we did a breakdown of libra traits because we're both libras he loved being on the show so actually yeah this is a good thing if you guys have any ideas because kobe wants to come back on the show producer kobe if you have any other ideas of things that kobe and i should react to put them in the chat and because we need some other ideas because he is ready to be back he was showing me um comments he like compiled comments of people being like chloe was great and then was like showing me like his family that had messaged him about it so we got to bring him back on we got to do it but yes um outside of producer copy we are gonna be doing some interviews um hopefully i have some cool ones coming up but we do need to get a better situation just than having them like sit in the bean bag not that i don't love the bean bag but it is not the most structured chair so when you sit into it it's kind of like you just you know curl into the wall anyway so we're working through the logistics of it but yeah for sure please do a live stream of ocarina in time you're going to gain a whole new group of sims thanks paul um i might it was it genuinely was so long ago that i probably could do it again and have no idea i'd probably be worse at it because i'd be doing without my brother who was like yelling me encouragement the entire time um let's see red redemption 2 is the coolest horse game right now is that the same person who said that before what is this what what is this game i can't tell if you guys are being serious let's see um [Music] oh here we go i did the singing thing again i can't stop i can't stop i think it's better than saying um another filler words at least i'm just providing you all music but now i can't get it out of my head anyway seeing so many states passing constitutional carry bills makes me hope that they will start passing laws to defy the nfa and the gca of uh 1968. you support any gun control all gun laws laws our infringements change my mind um yes i do i would love it if they were passing laws to defy the nfa no i do believe that all gun laws are infringements um i think that we need to abolish the atf that's a big hot point of mind because the atf is a gross example of government overreach they're one of the only arms of government that is oh my god i can't even speak the reason why they have such gross overreach is because they can basically change gun control make different guns illegal make people into felons overnight just by changing even like bylaws and wording in the nfa and they don't have to get a vote in congress they don't have to you know put it through any government body they can literally just change the wording uh in that and suddenly thousands of people are now technically felons have to turn in their weapons and that kind of thing so they are way too powerful that was just a long i could talk about that for hours i don't know how much i want to get into but yes i agree with you there um i'm not sure kind of music you're into oh hello this all moved around so fast not sure what kind of music you're into but have you heard of the band slip turn camp uh yes i have i listen to camp pretty regularly i think of like that yeah the coffee house kind of music is like kind of my fall music vibe ish i think i like listen to music in seasons but i've mentioned it before but my favorite band is band camino so everything sort of in that vein like 1975 and then definitely into this more indie that kind of thing let's see the ufos have been around forever see the bible if they were a threat they would have not waited for us to develop nukes and lasers to be a threat interesting point elon musk or jeff bezos i'm honestly unsure which one i like better definitely elon musk jeff bezos is giving us little like crumbs of baseness but he needs his actions need to follow some of his tweets by now elon musk is the only one acting upon anything and i think actually putting his neck out on the line for us hey no name no name comes in every day every live and says crap i'm late that being said are you data secure why not secure with expressvpn you could tend to get three months free at some point i've got to get a vpn sponsorship guys that'll really make ben and i look the same greetings from germany do you think that horse girl stereotypes are often accurate i don't know i i'm gonna ask my producer do you think that i give off the like normal horse girl vibes well all i'll say is when we did that episode yes i don't feel that you accurately represented what a horse girl is really fully yes okay so i don't know if you guys i need to get him a mic he basically said that when i was doing my horse girl episode i didn't fully accurately depict what a horse girl is so maybe i need to do a separate video i left a couple things out okay i don't know so i love i can answer this question i think that some of them are i mean i think it's a difficult blanket statement to me because i definitely have met you know equestrian girls that are horse girls but i also think i'm i'm semi chill i don't know guys i i have been told i should do a whole horse girl video where i either do bug maybe that'll be my response to stephen crowder and i'll do a whole debunking it might be bad for me though because then i'll end up just pinning myself as a full crazy horse girl but you know what that's life that's living on the internet people are gonna call me that that's okay let's see [Music] um you played oh my gosh you guys are really popping off now you play the best zelda game ever i love you woo love it a great enough time i don't understand what you guys are talking about red dead redemption 2 you i don't i don't why are you laughing at me is this an inside joke that i'm not a part of apparently it is because he's laughing more um let's see if i listen to the wallows no i haven't but i'll look them up forget that rubbish music you need to listen to oasis live forever is the best song of all time i know of oasis i don't know i'm really bad at song titles very bad uh so if i hear a song i'll know what it is but i especially with bands too like i just the name recognition is not there let's see you people in red uh dead redemption okay i will watch the trailer i will look at what it is because now i'm confused enough i'm going to get off this live now because it's coming to the end of the day and i've got to head out but i will look up the trailer but anyway guys thank you so much for being here i'm glad we got to chat about ufos if you have any more ufo or alien stories you can always dm me i'll try to get to it you can tweet at me that sort of thing comment on one of the videos and i will i'll try to find it but anyway this is super fun guys per usual um oh now people are sending you more music things anyway guys this was a great time i will see you later this week we do another live we're gonna try to be doing these two times a week now uh the comment section episodes should be up shortly and tomorrow check back in we're gonna do some elon musk maybe some crazy disney stuff they're acting real weird and groomery uh so yeah i will see you guys later this week i hope you have a wonderful rest of your night alright see ya you", "_Aszvt7sAEA": "[Music] butterfly in the sky i can go twice as high this is dylan james

just have to interject because first of all why was i not invited to this my name's brett i'm a girl with a boy's name for the first time i'm actually in support of dylan here because i've responded to her his videos a lot it is weird that people get so triggered by the fact that i'm a girl with a boy's name this is still a boy biologically with a boy's name so it's different but people are

and you ate a ton of gluttonous food and are sitting on your couch probably watching football and doing online shopping so while you're online shopping I thought that I should show you some of our incredible products we have for you a daily wire okay so this Black Friday we are doing 40 off all daily wire merchandise on our website we are also doing 50 off daily wire plus memberships this is an incredible time to get that subscription if you have a liberal leaning person in your life that you want to turn based if you've dumped your liberal boyfriend and you have a new boyfriend and you want to make sure he stays on the right side of things wink wink you can also get him a subscription or tell your parents that you want a daily wire Plus subscription for Christmas literally the best time of year to get that anyway first of all these boxes are absolutely epic sadly my merch does not arrive to you in this I wish it did but I sent these out to our Polaroid giveaway winners and I thought they were so cool so I wanted you guys to see them but I do have some of the merchant here okay so this one I actually don't know what's in here my team has boxed them up for me this is my first unboxing video guys I feel like a real YouTuber now okay cool first of all look how sick this is our creative team is literally epic so when the Polaroid winners were notified they got the Polaroid like framed in here and it was signed and a bunch of stuff and we had our Zoom call so this is the cream Polaroid tea we did this collection to celebrate hitting a million subscribers you guys made that happen this is super fun it is oversized it is a really thick material when we were designing these I said that I wanted t-shirts that were like t-shirts that you hung up rather than like stuffed in a drawer albeit I stuff all of my laundry in drawers anyway I'm trying to be better I'm trying to be somebody that hangs up my clothes they're super high quality they're nice they're super thick you've got my signature down on the tag it's an actual Polaroid it celebrates a million very very cool tag with the BC logo so that one's in cream and we have the one in black this one does not have my face on it but it is a another Polaroid that we took during the merch photo shoots this is my legs and the classic white headphones which I actually don't have on right now and the white Converse that you guys basically see in literally every single post that I put up on Instagram anyway those are classic you guys have sold these out multiple times now we are on our third restock of these and we restocked them just for Black Friday so if you want 40 off of them you can go do that right now they're awesome like I said pretty oversized so if you want a tighter fit I would recommend sizing down or if you're like me and you want something that's big and comfortable get your normal size but no need to like intentionally size up if you want something that is cozy I can't get the box back together there we go okay okay now we have the other t-shirts I feel like these are like one of the underrated items I actually didn't know that this gray one had sold out partially on the website which was shocking to me because I didn't see a ton of hype around them people were first buying them but I think they're super cool it says the comment section Studios on the front established 2022 and then the back is super cool it feels like a band crew tea and I like it because it feels like I mean you guys made this happen and so I want you all to feel like you are part of the team but it's just very fun it's really chill laid back they're a tad oversized not as big as the Polaroid one so we also have it in the classic cream which is very fun same stuff on the back I just like it it makes me feel like I'm a lot cooler than I really am guys that's the reality of this okay now we're on to my favorites though which are the bench kits this is what I literally wear all the time and you know what I do get some pushback at the office literally our VP of production the other day I was walking around wearing one of these and he was like Brett you know the first sign that you're letting stuff get to your head is when you're walking around wearing your own merch and I was like listen it's really comfortable I genuinely like it and it's not like I'm walking around in the shirt that has my face on it so I think that that's a little better but these are the binge kits so we have a crop this is for the ladies this is the cropped purple this is the one that I was wearing yesterday on the show has a really awesome tag that our incredible designers put together I would have never thought that you need to be detailed about the tag but it has my signature it says capsule one because more is coming soon don't worry designed in Nashville with classic BC logo the tag on the inside is also cool again I didn't know that in doing like merch and like the hypey stuff I didn't know that that's stuff you actually had to care about also the material on this is epic I get really annoyed with t-shirts when they have that like kind of fake fleece lining and it's cool for like a week and then starts pilling and getting all over your shirts especially if you're wearing like a white hoodie and then you have a black shirt on and it's literally everywhere you will not have this problem this is 100 cotton it is French terry the fabric on the inside is literally amazing and look there's another tag and it has my favorite Ein Rand code on it it's literally so sick like every single aspect of this merch is tailored and personalized it says the question isn't who is going to let me it is who is going to stop me which I really like because I am a very driven person and then we have the purple shorts that match the purple crop shirt again for the ladies or if you're a guy that really just wants to be like popping around in some short shorts I don't discriminate buy whatever you want they're awesome you see BC designed in Nashville again the classic tag it's great okay and then there's a black version that is exactly like the purple one this is another cropped hoodie and matching shorts literally what I sit around on the weekend in uh embarrassingly in my own merch but at least I'm not wearing the one with my face on it like I said earlier okay last set okay so this is the black oversized hoodie I'm actually just gonna put this on right now so this was a crowd favorite this is completely sold out on the website we are sadly not going to restock it so I'm just going to put it on but this is the oversized tee and boys I think you are the ones who sold this out and for good reason you're gonna love it it's insanely comfortable like on the cropped hoodies you will see my signature is embroidered on the wrist and this is another Factor that's on all of the hoodies it has a thorn right here because people around the office have called me the thorn in the left's ear rather than the thorn in the left side so we have a thorn right here which is fun it's a little inside uh Easter egg for you and then for the guys I also have some pants for you in case you don't want to be walking around looking like a hoochie mama in these shorts these are the sweatpants that will go with your oversized jacket sweatshirt jacket all the BC stuff is here on the left knee on this one rather than being up on the hip like on the shorts and then of course you have the thorn per usual it's all very consistent which I like but it's subdued enough that I feel like people are gonna be like oh you're clearly wearing merch like it actually seems pretty chill which is what I wanted because for this first capsule I wanted to give you guys stuff that I felt like had long-term wearability like this is all incredible quality but also I'm not talking about a specific story or something I talk about on the show a lot that would kind of move with the news cycle basically I wanted you guys to have something that was like this is capsule one this is like the comment section Brett Cooper you guys can have this literally forever and it'll last forever so anyway I hope you guys enjoy all of this if you have already ordered I can't wait to see your pictures in it if you have not ordered yet this is the time to do it get 40 off of all of this at dailywire.com Brett and then you can get 50 off of your daily wire plus memberships using Code dw50 this is literally the perfect time to be buying a membership you will not get a better deal for the

along that story uh jeremy how are you i'm doing well thanks for thanks for having me on it's uh it was a pleasant surprise this afternoon to be spending it with you so i appreciate it well i'm glad you're here okay guys so i want some explanation because we were watching the chat earlier and i asked jeremy this um he doesn't uh stream as often as i do on youtube but for the last three weeks y'all you have been spamming the chat with eggs and i just saw one of you say egg chain what does that mean jeremy doesn't know i don't know my producer doesn't know and i've been like trying to figure it out i feel like a boomer on urban dictionary being like what do youtube why are people like putting egg emojis so if somebody wants to explain that that'd be great i know at the beginning of my channel when i like did my first stream people were also spamming the chat with corn emojis it was a big corn one um pineapple was another one you guys must really think that i just love food oh there we go another egg they're just going through like food pyramid at this point i mean look i mean you did just break kind of the first rule of chat spam acknowledging it i know but it's it fascinates me see they're doing it again see if one of you will explain it then i won't care you just confuse me desperately see i don't understand people anyway so jeremy i want to know so was this the this is the second time that you were swatted or is this the first okay so this but what's interesting about this one guys is that tim paul i think he's on his ninth swatting now he got swatted jeremy you were in the chat i was watching temples live that night can you walk me through what happened yeah sure i mean i think you know i was just doing my um my regular memeing in his chat uh so tim was currently going through a swat it was away from the studio streaming in front of 40 000 people in empty chairs so i thought what a great opportunity to show for my coffee company so then i started like doing all the i saw it in chat already i love it so i started like you know wow what a very stressful situation good thing we have some delicious organic keys or whatever like the thing was or whatever and like tim and i we believe this is what happened we can't know this but it seems reasonable the person who swatted him then got mad that i was sending so many super chats to him that he then did it to me and um was able to get a full swat rollout get my family put in handcuffs uh with an anonymous text message um that read like like if you would read it like it said um uh that he just ended his wife with a high power rifle and he's gonna he's gonna do it to himself that like nobody actually says yeah obviously it's like such a weird thing um and uh yeah it was it was not awesome especially like now i can look back at it and laugh but you know the reality is you know i do carry where lawful and uh my dogs were kind of going berserk and there were just people outside fully armed in my yard in the dark i mean this i may have walked out there and ended up you know i didn't know they were police you know um so yeah it was really uh crummy and for people who don't know so swatting is a normal kind of i don't know if they would call it shoulder what wasn't when we like googled the actual definition it's like a criminal uh there's a specific word that they use but they're trying to attack people it's just a way of attacking somebody where you send some kind of anonymous fake tip the swat team comes in but what i was not sure about and what i have never known with like tim is they don't just barge in did they because they gave you some warning which was even more ridiculous because they called your wife she answered and was like i'm alive and they were still outside so they obviously didn't bargain but how did all that work yeah so they called me i didn't see i hardly ever look at my cell phone so i always tell people like uh just text my wife because i'm not paying attention um and so they're calling my phone i don't answer what i didn't know at the time is they were already here looking in my windows okay so i was walking around like without a shirt on drinking a white claw as they were calling me the swat team's outside they're calling me and i'm just like technically it wasn't a white cloud they thought it was it was a high noon but neither of them paid me so i don't care what you insert what i was drinking i was drinking coffee brand coffee but the uh so that i don't answer right and they see me walking around they call my wife's phone and it's just a local number at i think 11 o'clock at night she happens to answer it and they're just like oh this is dispatch um do you live at this address and she's like what the hell is this even so then she calls me in there she's like some weirdo they say to the police blah blah blah i take i'm like here give me the phone so obviously they know she's not dead at this point but uh then the dispatcher is like oh the cop they just want to talk to you they just want to talk to say okay put them on so i sat on hold for like five minutes it came back like oh there's just a disturbance in the neighborhood would you go outside um and just talk to the officer and i'm like what do you mean everything's fine you know what's going on they would not tell me so then they're like oh just he just wants to talk to you so i walk out the door and then there's like 15 guys with assault rifles get on the ground like totally over the top um and like this is something i talked about with my lawyer um half asian super lawyer bill richmond is uh you know like there are some civil liberties that are in question here that i believe were violated um because it was very obvious at this point that might that it was a hoax they didn't need to still keep it at 100 miles an hour yeah um so anyway yeah and then the whole time i'm like guys this is the swatting obviously and they wouldn't tell me a single thing until i was handcuffed all the way back and then my wife was handcuffed then they said oh well we got an anonymous text saying that this happened so then i go berserk i'm like are you guys freaking kidding me uh get the handcuffs off my wife which they immediately did do at that time took them off me i was like you know this is insanity um and so at this point i was really hoping they had body cams because i thought i sounded pretty bad ass but um they didn't which is also concerning yeah it is and i'm like i'm like a pro cop guy too so i'm like i'm kind of put in this weird spot where like i understand that when when you break it down they're like dude we were calling you and you're just walking around the house drinking yeah um you didn't answer the phone we rang the doorbell you didn't answer the door well i have the ringer off because i have two german shepherds and i have a wife who goes to amazon.com a lot so i get like 30 deliveries a day my dogs go berserk if i leave the doorbell on and i can't record videos so there was like this perfect storm of other things that they tried to say would have de-escalated the situation i don't think it would have because they also then still went into my house after i refused multiple searches and they said that oh we have exigent circumstances no you don't my wife's right here you don't yeah um and so then they still wanted us anyway you mentioned it earlier and i'll wrap it up i believe it's not just like so people out in like chat might think it's a prank to me this is an attempted murder they want something to go bad and like and that's it's a it's a class five felony it's a it's a major crime and uh yeah if you're doing this you're trying to get somebody killed and uh so like all jokes aside like it's it's kind of super serious yeah and it's great that you know you and tim both you know understand your rights are you know cool and collected even though they missed your you know badass speech and all of that because for somebody who would lose their cool not understand what to do would be in a more volatile situation that could turn south immediately um and it's just incredibly indicative of where our culture has gone at least i think where people make jokes about like okay well you know these haters these trolls they hide behind screens they won't actually do anything like maybe they'll send you death threats but they don't actually care the left just they aren't that bad but then when you see things like this where it's like okay well it's not them doing it but they are still hiding behind the screen but yes they are attempting to you know cause you harm to absolutely disrupt your family i mean it's it's disgusting how will they have swat teams if they defund the police how will they you know it will make their swattings go away yeah there's some belief that these people are politically motivated given their targets i'm not super political uh i mean i guess i have my opinions but i'm not like where i'm like talking about hot political issues every day but you know there is some belief who these people are um and like just because i was super chatting tim um you know and by the way because of that you know i hope they know that uh we had like a thousand orders of coffee that night so incredible take that yeah i love i know i saw people in the chat putting all your discount codes and that kind of thing they were stoked i love it um do you think okay i hate the word court or not the word but the phrase coordinated like effort because i feel like that's so abused these days it's like oh my god it's a coordinated whatever but okay so you were saying you don't think it is politically motivated you know know more about this than i do what was the first spotting like who do you think might be behind it um is it like a group of people is it a certain type of person yeah well it's it's it is a group of people and they use a discord to coordinate this stuff this there are certain things that i can say out loud you know because they've been spoken out but also it's an ongoing investigation too so i'll try to toe the line here and make it interesting so yeah there are people in a discord who uh you know and look they're using it's so it's like they're using a vpn and then they're using um a service called text now for example a canadian like there's a million services that do this um that's we'll se you can send text messages from right so they're using vpns at minimum then they're using these anonymous text they're never really picking up the phone yeah they're always using it so the first time i got swat it was a text second they texted the non-emergency number of my fire department because they knew if they did it like to the police they would be like oh this is baloney um and so like but in my opinion you know obviously like it's more than just one loser sitting at home it's a couple of them probably i've had certain people say oh i know who it is blah blah blah i'm in there you know i don't like you uh but i don't think this is okay i had probably 50 different people like that with tips and most of them went nowhere um because i had put out a reward i think i put out a ten thousand dollar reward on catching tim's uh swatter that probably did not make them happy but uh nobody really turned on him for 10 grand so i guess it's probably a small knit group of people but yeah it's you know there are there are different types of scenarios like if we look at the case that happened in missouri it was like two gamers somebody lost their life over three dollar i think it was a two dollar bet in call of duty um they the swat came in they had headphones on right they busted down the door they turned around you know dead yeah another guy died because somebody wanted his twitter handle yeah so the swat team shows up and he has a heart attack and dies um which is what i was most concerned about outside yeah but um yeah it's uh it's it's wild and it's it's actually super surprising that that it still works that was like the mo i felt embarrassed for my police i was like dude are you kidding me yeah like you know i'm gonna make a video about this and like 500 000 people are gonna be laughing at you and thinking like how the heck did did yeah you really didn't think that you didn't pick up on it that it was a you know a fake call yeah which goes back to all the stuff where people are screaming about like to fund the police and all that i'm like no i actually think that we probably need to give them some help and maybe more funding and resources so that they can you know be better trained or have something so that they can detect what is a hoax what is you know a swat that kind of thing uh well i just think like if you're if a text comes in and you can identify that it comes from these like it's like you know text generation can we just not deploy swat in like all those cases like if i was really in a tactical scenario am i am i browsing to some like text no i'm sending it from an actual cell phone but can we at least make some smart changes policy for that yeah filtering situation hold up jeremy i keep losing you on my thing me but i do want to look briefly at our super chats because there are people that are wanting to ask you things quickly or that are just send her lots of super chats there we go well they are um hey james how are you um i love it somebody said i'm here for the coffee brand coffee show can we get a discount code for the quartering for a quarter off all orders is what somebody said a quarter off there you go i know they're trying to believe you need a spicy discount that's like going out of business i know yeah now they're trying to somebody said us mexicans are like um us mexicans are like you got swatted we get iced daily i'm sorry to i'm sorry to point out your internalized racism yeah you are a latinx person not a mexican guy please get that hate speech out of the chat you got to be like aoc call out everybody yeah let's see what is this oh okay all right here we go bryson thank you an egg is a cross-dresser that then comes out as trans they're basically saying you're trans ben oh bench beer oh my god is that why or have you guys all been piling on so german if you know but everybody says that i look like ben and nobody i didn't see it and now i can't not see it okay that's exactly what happened so when i was hired nobody knew that i had had a couple of people like on i had a bit of a presence online who would you know dm me be like oh you kind of look like ben shapiro that's funny that never landed with me until i got here and then all of the daily wire folks were like holy crap it's literally you his parents were in uh visiting the studio a while back and his mom came up to me and went oh my god you could be one of my kids i was like okay well now i can't escape so well then have her put you in the will exactly come on i'm shapiro now let's do it uh but no so if that really is what it is guys then that's like a deep cut that you guys are making that's a super yeah that's a super uh deep lore or b side off of the obscure album absolutely they uh a lot of people think that it's a deep fake they have not actually seen us together yet they have but not in like real life fashion so come the ryman show that we're doing at the end of the month maybe people will finally be convinced let's see uh somebody says the legendary kit is good from a real customer yeah hey love it uh paul says poor jeremy all this because your wife's real i know it's really tough it's really upsetting for the internet to find out too like i'm supposed to be like an incel you know it really is really tough i know that was that that was the whole goal of this maybe was to expose you yeah let's see uh ask quartering about the quantum tv situation what is that that's from richard it's a really long story um i'll keep it really quick you know you keep um if you want keep reading your super chats and then i'll and i'll talk about it yeah once we get it right yeah um let's see what else do we have here awesome view to highlight the spread the serious issue needs more eyes on yeah i totally agree i mean and i feel like now with he gets swatted so much people aren't even talking about it and it's kind of like a joke but it really is not and so i appreciate uh people are you know trying to take it some more seriously he brought what is a woman is this an adult human female also known as a bleeder or a person who menstruates maybe a birth giver or any of those whatever you want i identify as you know an egg apparently uh yeah in a way yeah let's see two pack holograms going on high quartering that's from james yeah that's true everybody says that ben and i that's it that's another one caleb is graduating today from seattle public schools hello private conservative out of state college hell yeah could you hold on a second brett yeah did you just call him tupac oh my god did i tupac sorry i here's the thing yeah i know you're young here's the thing i am not only young but i also am devoi what would you say sheller devoid of all pop cult not even that just important yes uh i was a weird homeschooler first of all uh i know was not allowed to watch television uh for any part of my life didn't even have tv barely really just listen to musical theater for my entire childhood because i was also a theater nerd and a horse girl so i have everything against me truly yeah it really does all boil down to you being homeschooled i know i know it's what i do but now it's ironic because i follow pop culture now but anything that is you know before three years ago basically once i joined the real world but yes um let's see uh gonna get me some coffee brand coffee tea to go along with my jeremy's razors double grift hell yeah that is double grip congrats oh my god what is this now i'm in the double screen this is wild our whole operation losing our mind over here do you have a picture and picture of yourself yeah that's how egotistical i am yeah um i want to make sure everybody knows let's see uh somebody says keep the grip going when is the beard gone and is around is rackets joining you for it that's what somebody asked uh yeah tomorrow at 5 30. so ricada i went on rakeda stream after the incident and um i said like hey if we hit the sales number or whatever i'll shave my beard and then with like a snap of his finger he's like yeah okay and then like i swear i've never i mean there was 500 plus people checking out at one time my god and um i i was like okay well fine i haven't shaved in 15 years so it'll be awful okay but also like i'm a mad at my word you know and um i love it we didn't quite hit it but we got close enough so it's it's fine you know what you're doing better than uh maybe i shouldn't call him out here on the live but matt promised his fans matt walsh promised his fans that when he hit 100 or no a million subscribers which he did over the weekend that he would do an interpretive dance has he done one yet no so you are you're sticking with yours and that is that is impressive i'm a man yes i'm a man of my and i'm not gonna so i'm gonna do it in a live stream okay here you go which like only a small percentage of my viewers will watch and then like i'm not gonna mention anything okay so then friday videos like the first video come up i'm just gonna do all my video without acknowledging that i've shaved my beard and appreciate it perform yeah it should be fun it's going to lose our damn mind um somebody says do what do fish get thirsty maybe that feels like it's in the same line as like is water wet yeah i don't believe that one how are we doing sheller are you okay quantum tv is a youtuber that yeah it's currently getting screwed over on youtube that is very long a very long story that i don't think she carved out time for me to go through but shout out to the act man um and he has my support love it i will uh follow up on that y'all because that's something that i've heard that is going on but i'm not up to date on so i will get clued in on that and see what i can do uh oh somebody ben thank you my dude he says i would be ashamed of being homeschooled or being sheltered i you know useless pop culture things and games and you've done real stuff at what 20 damn i appreciate it there we go my uh my shelteredness helps in some capacities i guess kept me out of it i suppose it does yeah yeah exactly um you want me to do a cooking live stream no no no that would be terrible i would get nervous and screw up everything they want to watch you just pick up your phone and do a door dash order uh yeah actually that would work that would work because i have a good rancher sponsorship so they want me to do a cooking whatever so that literally is what it would be i would order something oh yes justice for actsmen um hello from the other side hello let's see should we uh let me know what we should do sheller because you're the one managing all this sorry for the uh technical stuff jeremy that's fine i'm totally relaxed because i had a nice cup of relaxing chamomile tea from coffeebrandcoffee.com yeah so let's hear all your let's hear an ad read let's give your uh pitch to the comment section the they call themselves the cooper troopers also possibly i think they've adopted like a simp army kind of thing is what they say so if you want to throw out a pitch for coffee brand coffee sure do it yeah it's not fair by the way that female content producers fans are automatically called sims um i know this is an issue with like sydney and like a few other people um so i uh i stand with you my my fellow viewers of female content creators who are not simps listen but it's hard because then anybody who hates me then calls like any of my fans like they like hassan did a video about me because he thought that i was like fun oh i know he said i was stealing his flow uh and he said that the only people that watch me are like in cells and i was like hey hey like i i care about i care about the guys i care about the boys we don't call them those names they're the cooper troopers such a lame insult too like it was like try harder yeah yeah the um make the uh make the insult about me not about the people who watch my videos like that's not even i can take it yeah i don't think his audience is really known for being ultra high q but anyway no but yes give me your pitch let's do it okay cough your brand coffee coffee teas and uh coffee organic loose leaf tea and three different flavors of hot cocoa from a company who is apolitical who just wants to make coffee tea and cocoa and then shut up you won't see any um any political issues tweeted about by us we won't be arguing with our customers on twitter um you know it's a company that doesn't hate you and incredible if yeah it's rare these days and that i won't i won't like bore people with a long show but all i can say is if you go to the website read the reviews there's 600 plus reviews incredible from actual customers and if you don't buy something from me today the swatters win that's true there we go that really is the pitch like that is that should be it all right guys so go check out the quartering please go subscribe to his channel and buy some coffee because he is orti or hot cocoa because he's about to shave his beard tomorrow and you need to give it like you deserve it uh if he's gonna do that somebody should please order some more coffee so that those numbers are boosted for him jeremy thank you so much for coming on i appreciate you sharing that story it really is important um yeah thank you for having me yeah of course i really appreciate it and i will chat with you soon all right guys i'm gonna i'm gonna stay on but uh everybody say bye to jeremy all right bye let's see oh my god all right sorry about all the technical stuff guys um i need to catch up on these super chats let's see eli you know who eats snails people who hate fast food that's a good joke i appreciate that uh folk hero alex jones huge fan of the quartering i just discovered you brett love your content thanks for speaking truth when others are afraid too i appreciate it thank you so much somebody has a okay from a real customer his velvety hot cocoa is awesome i actually had no idea i thought that it was just coffee and tea i had no idea that he has hot chocolate so this is a game changer quartering sims rise up i love it yeah guys like jeremy deserves some simps don't we all let's see james i don't identify as a sip so calling me one is a slur and hate speech also speaking of companies going political lego is going full pride oh my god wait that's something cool have you guys did you see the intersex video that they did uh i wonder if it's here uh don't pull up my screen yet because i'll see lego intersex uh oh i'm scared about this is gonna pull up um ad week oh god this publication if you ever want to see like here you can pull this up if you ever want to see terrible terrible also you can see my uh stochastic terrorism that i was working on this morning um if you ever uh want to see terrible cringe corporate takes ad week it is like the publication where ad agencies and that kind of thing go and stroke their egos about the woke progressive you know political bs that they're doing it's kind of hysterical and it's great for my content so i'll take it but look at this why lego is asking the lgbt plus community to build a giant pride alphabet out of bricks and this was on june 1st they have they they're making their own oh they're we'll be having inclusive bricks it's going to be great a to z of awesome campaign it's going to run into 2023 and we'll create an alphabet out of lego bricks that teaches vocabulary uh educates that kind of thing um this isn't all right so that's a to z of awesome wait the one i wanted was the intersex where's the video intersex ad if he was just on uh instagram which i can't get logged in on this damn pc it's not the pc's fault it's the fact that my thing isn't working i don't know if i can go to videos no i is for intersex really do we need that new toy set could you slack me that thing or i think it might be earlier uh it was on uh what are you here wait take me off the screen chair and i'll come back i'm gonna find it y'all and then we're gonna hold on talks amongst yourselves for just one moment do i have it ah i want to show it to you i wish i could just hold up my damn phone um listen i'm gonna i don't know how to find this thing because it's on instagram yeah but i can't i was trying to watch it this morning and it wasn't loading my techno technology is losing its mind today but actually a follower sent this to me so guys i do see your dms and i do see when you especially when you put like content for comment section that i know that it's like some crazy thing that i need to pay attention to um i wonder if i could go to where is the intersex a to z of awesome oh these people are so weird they're so creepy hello is for intersex when was this oh it was an ad that's why i wasn't showing up it was specifically okay guys wait can you see this hold on here we go when i found out i was interested i didn't know what intersex meant oh wait hold on let's do this here can i have all my stuff up guys this is so janky i don't care my name with is traits that don't fall neatly into the binary of male or female i created a build for this project and the letter i chose was i to represent that's the a to z okay like i love like intersex is real that's normal that's like a scientific biological thing also yeah i know i'm a boomer i've been trying to figure out i don't know what my it keeps not locking me out of my instagram on this computer maybe it thinks i'm getting hacked because i keep getting notifications i don't really know i'm going to figure it out at some point i will become technologically savvy i promise but anyway sorry that you just had to see my like weird boomer phone screen but yes intersex is real it is a biological scientific medical thing that happens but i think that it is 0.5 or less of the population and being intersex does not then mean that you are inherently you know non-binary it just means that like you are not your chromosomes whatever it does not like it's not related to like all these people that are thinking that they're like no gender but a lot of people i think lump them in and so when we say like there are two genders people are like no no no no there's not okay well that person you know either has like one genitalia or another so i still think that you know there are two genders but regardless uh lego got torched in the comments uh my favorite thing was had no clue this is lego until the end of this video don't see how this appeals the lego people yeah child toy doesn't need this attached just like we don't need to attach anything outside of the lego toy brand in my opinion straight to gray it doesn't belong here it's a child's toy ffs um [Music] yeah all these people somebody said it's still made of fossil fuels okay like go touch grass you apparently seem to be some environmental person calm down literally what is this wtf is this when your own audience or children you post this you really want to groom these people yeah well it's not even like alex do they get tired of bending a knee to a minuscule percent of our population who are screaming and are insane all the time like do you not get exhausted by being you know down there like licking the boots of these whatever like come on it's so boring i feel bad for anybody who like are at these ad agencies having to do these bs political things over and over again it can't feel good but also these people are so like i don't know have their heads on screwed backwards or they think they're really progressing society forward by making ads about intersex lego toys it's just ridiculous literally this stripping away all of that what does being intersex have to do with legos do you really are you so distraught because you do not feel represented or seen in your damn lego no i think you need to go do some work on yourself if you do not feel seen by a lego like that it's not his worst it's not as bad as i say it sounds worse it's not as bad as the preschool teachers i watched a video this morning oh my god guys of a i think was a kindergarten teacher or no that was another that was a few days ago this one was maybe fifth grade or something like that she was crying in her car because she came out to her students and they affirmed her or whatever and she was like i just didn't know how much i needed them and i needed their like affirmation made me feel so safe lady if you get your affirmation from children like that's a problem that's why you have friends that are your own age that's why maybe you have a therapist or something like that it's just weird stop like trauma dumping on kids my gosh okay let me back to my super chat sorry guys i got i went on a bit of a rant there um does jeremy's razor ship to canada i am not sure um i can check on that um but let's see uh i can't sit for you you aren't a star wars nerd i know i know and i did make a promise that i would watch uh i would re-watch because i have seen them they're just not in the forefront of my mind the three what i call important star wars films the og is that the og they're they're the only important star wars films okay can i get some clarification what do people call those are those ot yeah original trilogy okay great that that now i have some clarification because i always say like i've seen the three i just don't like i don't follow it okay i've seen the ot the og why do you make me sound like a grandma um because that's kind of how you sound okay but we should do that though we should we you should watch the star wars movies and then we can like do a a video where you review all of them i can do that that sounds good okay guys what are you gonna come soon um i can do that not like this weekend because i don't have time to do that this weekend but i can like next week i'll watch them all right are we having movie night are we having team movie night i think we should do that but when we watch the movies we can't so if you watch them on video if you watch them on blu-ray for example now when you watch them you're gonna be seeing like the 22nd version of each one of these movies where george lucas has gone in and added things and changed things uh-huh we don't want to see that so does that mean i need to use your og blu-rays to watch it well no like there are there are ways of watching the original trilogy okay let's just say unofficial ways that are not vhs okay okay but there are ways of doing something he says de-specialized editions there you go i actually do my family does have the all the the ot the ot on vhs do i have that vhs player no but i do know that we have it no we're going to watch it in full 4k uh resolution we're going to kobe's house that's what i'm hearing kobe producer chloe we're watching star wars well not to not to step on kobe's feet or anything oh do you have a better tv yes okay wow there's some competition in uh on my team of producers guys let's see um okay brett brett ay hey we have name hello name buddy just want to tell you that your sponsorship segway game has reached nole's level also nice name yeah nice to you too thank y'all you know it's really funny um whenever i whichever video has my ad segue in it the majority of the comments are like ah that's so funny i always look for your ad read whatever i had no idea that that was like such a thing but i do genuinely have fun with those because it is kind of creative i can like slide it in in a way and it keeps me entertained it keeps things interesting let's see oh i do my do to do's again we still need to like stream together like a song of me singing the doo doo doos if you are new here when i'm filling silence as i'm scrolling or pulling up like my viewer you know pulling up the super chats that's what it is that honestly should be the comment section theme song that'll be good uh let's see uh get your production team to use lightning hdmi cable for your phone for the stream it can also charge your phone dude do i am i is my phone about to die oh it is you guys yeah that's kind of a normal thing in my life it is constantly on the verge of death yeah we just kind of need a lot of stuff we do listen we are very we are we make it work we make it work yeah one might call us uh scrappy we are becau well also this show blew up so fast that it was kind of like oh my gosh now we're streaming all the time we need to get this new stuff we need to get this equipment so anyway i appreciate your super chats guys because we got new streaming equipment that has actually been very helpful we're trying this is our quarterly uh quartering was our first guest so we were figuring out that stuff today um but it's been a journey it has been let's see okay paul says i identify as a higher rank than i am in the military but they still won't pay me more unfortunately you should go in with like all the pride stuff and be like i identify a four-star general and just see what happens um i can't make a daily wire account because i have a norwegian phone number and it's the wrong format i think oh no okay um have

email they're fantastic our member experience folks they'll handle that there's a new drag oh new kids drag queen on discovery plus what do you think about that yeah that is a hot mess i have watched part of that show i think one of my earlier live streams was about that um the drag stuff guys where did it come from like we had i remember it was in la and we would have you know drag queen brunches in west hollywood and there would be drag queens at pride and that was it what is it about 2020 where suddenly all of these drag queens are showing up like this is dr being a drag queen is apparently the career to have right now they are in every school they're hosting children's events they're at pride per usual they're still doing their champagne drag brunches they're performing at you know political events like that's the man it's like only fans is apparently out what you need to do if you want to make money is be a drag queen i guess let's see um quartering thanks for having me on and thanks to all the new subscribers and customers really appreciate the support coffee brand loves you too thank you so much jeremy you are fantastic uh so happy to have you on uh i think we have a good amount of i feel like crossover with audiences and so i'm excited to merge those let's see comment section movie night should become a regular thing yes but i also feel like i might actually this could be good because i do talk during movies i am one of those people oh my god you're going to kill me aren't you you mean you're you're female oh god my whole team is sexist i'm filing a complaint no i i do well i just choose there's there's like a meme out there where there's a girl and she's like bundled up in a blanket alone on a couch watching a movie and it's underneath the caption i'm probably butchering it but it says something like when a girl is alone who does she talk to while watching a movie or who answers her questions while watching a movie my dogs or the friends that i'm texting oh okay yeah or i just you know talk to myself well in that case then i'll probably be on my phone and i'll like look up the answers of my questions because i am self-sufficient but i do like to know things i also do appreciate when you watch things on amazon prime and the little sidebar comes up and you see all the actors and then it says like trivia i have those on the whole time because i immediately am like oh i know that person from something anyway let's see uh texas rodeos or tennessee rodeos and is gina your sister muscular from denton texas no a lot of people in my caption did think that she is my actual sister no we are a good friend she is a wonderful mentor fantastic brilliant woman not actually sisters also that would make us apparently also related to ben in a way maybe we're just all like a trifecta uh but no just a sister from another mr she's incredible though and i'm just so happy she's part of the daily wire family let's see i hope the daily wire can cover the quantum tv axemen issue going on you're the perfect voice to shed more light uh i will do some research on that tonight uh don't worry about that i will see what i learn and what i can cover let's see uh i would like to politely say that you looked the best the premiere last night everyone did but you were extra thank you so much i appreciate it that was really fun i don't get to get dressed up and do that very often um especially my uh ex tomboy nature i remember literally my childhood not childhood but like middle school to high school best friend distinctively remembered like the first time she ever saw me in a dress um and i actually was talking with my mom about that earlier it was around that time that she literally sat me down and we had to have a conversation about you know my you know femininity being woman that kind of stuff literally just because in our culture you're either like a hyper sexualized like bimbo whatever girl or the other option was you're just butch and basically a lesbian and if you were more tomboyish you immediately got lumped into i mean we're seeing it now it's like oh you're more tomboyish are you a boy are you a lesbian whatever and so she kind of saw that happening and i'm naturally you know a bit more i wouldn't say masculine at all but i was just i was raised around boys and my three older brothers and my mom is like very very tough and was also a tomboy and so as a result i was like wearing my doc martens and i was super like chill and tough and hanging with the boys and she noticed all that going on in our society and said it's it's like she basically said it is okay to be strong and to be tough and still like embrace the feminine things about you and that is powerful and that was something that you know she had to learn and she said in this you know culture um it's important to embrace both of those when they are telling you that you can be either or so that was really important but anyway all that being said i don't get to wear like dress up and do that kind of stuff very often so it was very fun um for the equipment funds thank you so much i appreciate it um howdy from vegas subbed as soon as i saw you triggered he who deserves to have his head on a biker that was good if you are ever in the southwest wish to partake in the devil's lettuce my gosh thanks joe i appreciate it uh oh also i didn't answer this cp texas rodeos or tennessee rodeos hot take idaho rodeos the best rodeo i've ever been to caldwell night rodeo uh my mom is in uh the boise region and uh i love the rodeos there the people are super chill really gritty um and tennessee is good there's a lot of really fantastic people i think the caliber is not as high but maybe i just haven't been to the right ones i also think they get a little more rowdy at in like texas idaho and so i you know i appreciate that because i like to be on my feet cheering so anyway but i haven't been to many texas radios my friend one of my best friends lives in houston and i think she only missed like two days of the entire houston rodeo this past year so i do have access to some texas rodeos i just need to get back into it let's see oh where's oh my gosh i scrolled i need to do to do uh what is a woman someone who talks during movies there we go that would actually be funny if we did what is a woman and then it was all like just the descriptors of women what are some of the other ones i don't know there's too many i'll come i'll do a whole thing um hey brad i've mentioned this a few times on other streams but i've made a discord oh yes datadev what is up okay so datadev has a discord for fans of the daily wire um the invite is daily wire i actually did a discord um uh q a like debate style thing the other day in pilot and like i think it's just called i think it's just called politics but it's the largest political discord on there but um i will join that i'll try that once i get off so i'm not distracted but because of that i re-downloaded discord and i'm actually on there again so i will jump in there maybe i could do a q a or something like that that'd be fun but anyway for anybody who is interested daily wire discord the invite is daily wire data dev i appreciate always being here uh james says i saw people on twitter say the drag has been going on since the 1500s like henry viii made a royal decreasing that all children have to watch men in drag in super outfits i mean that's basically what they were wearing though like henry viii in his little bloomers with tight little leggings on is that what they mean i don't know it might have also just been like court jesters and that kind of thing because that also okay here's another thing women were not allowed to perform and be on stage they were not unless they were like prostitutes that kind of think they weren't allowed to dance four people so as a result it was a lot of men cross-dressing it was not anything sexual did not have anything to do with like sexual identity that kind of thing it is why when shakespeare uh when all of his plays were put on every character was played by a man in court when they would have the court jesters they would all be played by men um so maybe that's what they're trying to leech onto there was cross-dressing but that was literally just because women were not it was not deemed suitable for women to be on stage so i know there's your bit of a history tidbit let's see uh when i was a kid guys dressing as women were for laughs yeah again like it was ha ha funny funny like slapstick something no why do you think more people are identifying more trans than ever before a huge question but i do think it is social contagion um and social contagion is this psychological idea that you know when you are with a group of people whether it is you know a trend like you know cutting your hair a certain way a fashion trend getting a you know few years ago a few years ago we started seeing it with you know depression and anxiety that it became very trendy for people to say like oh my god i'm so depressed i'm whatever i'm gonna go to therapy which is great go to therapy you know work on whatever you need to do but most people not most but a lot of people who say oh my god i'm so depressed you probably don't have clinical depression it's just very trendy to be you know ill in a way and i think that transgenderism has been kind of lumped into that and especially for young people it is trendy to be confused it is trendy to be you know queer pan i learned a new one omni i still know what that is maybe i can look that up in a minute omni whatever be under that umbrella um and you know what and that's kind of fine if you're a confused teenager and you don't you don't cut off your body and that sort of thing like if you're just going through your goth phase like they did in the 90s or whatever cool you're going to grow out of it the issue is that the medical industry and the left is capitalizing on this part of this trend the social contagion and is now turning it into this dollar industry where i think it's for every kid that goes you know undergoes you know these hormone replacement or her or you know puberty suppress suppressants uh the surgeries they make millions of dollars per kid it is a very profitable issue it is the same formula as big pharma and these are not moral people in the slightest and so i think that is why it is growing so fast but sadly it is becoming a trend but it's very serious because people are you know doing things that are you know irreversibly damaging for lack of a better word that's a fantastic book irreversible damage um so that's my kind of short longer answer let's see oh what is this uh love you right you're awesome also hashtag restore the snyder verse what's that do i don't know something it was a reference going over my head yeah i probably take a bit to explain okay i'll look it up later they want the zack snyder justice league dc universe restored cool don't know anything about that the only dc movie i've ever seen is wonder woman go gal gadot because i think she's cool politically oh my god her like imagine song that was stupid but yeah can't deal with her but the one the movie i was like badass so anyway that's all i know about dc private joker says do you like uh edm music not terribly um i think odessa is like soft edm that kind of thing that's as you know edm as i would go um nothing against it is just not uh my vibe somebody says sub home slice haven't heard that term in a while uh anyways that problem slice got a quick q for you who wins a five round mma match ben shapiro or matt walsh and how can we make it happen oh well ben if you guys look at his streams he does a gun show every single time for ben shapiro is hot which is his number one fan account and she posts it everywhere so ben he's you know he he can hold his own but matt walsh is also massive and so i think i mean it could be a good balance i really don't know i think ben is a bit more energetic but also i feel like matt is kind of like a sleeping bear and you know you poke him and maybe something will come out so i really don't know uh and how can we make it happen that would be a dream but i doubt either of them would ever do that i might go do some mma stuff though because our most recent film was with uh cowboy and gina so i have ufc fighters at my disposal and the running joke for the past months is like oh my god brett should fight gina i should not fight gina but maybe i could learn how to do some stuff or go like train with cowboy i don't know we'll see but if you guys want to see that i might do so i might get in the ring maybe i'll die who knows i get a black eye let's see um i would vote on a bill that says you can pretend to be whatever you want but you need to admit the pr uh the pretense when asked yeah that works that makes sense um idaho is better than texas don't don't tell the cali idiots hi from coeur d'alene hey love it yeah my mom is down in boise like i said i lived there for about nine months i it's an incredible place and people are discovering it though because gosh real estate there has sky like the prices have skyrocketed in the past year and because so much of idaho's public land we just can't build as much there so hidden gem for sure i still like i'll be intending to see people ask where my mom lives and i'll say oh in idaho and like what i actually don't know where that is or what that is i'm like potatoes and they're like oh okay so i feel like for a lot of people idaho still just the potato state um oh james okay no henry viii was a joke on me it's hard to know today what people actually believe in what is jokes yeah if you i totally would have believed that um oh perfect happy birthday zelda that is isaac's wife everybody say hello to or so say happy birthday to zelda it is isaac's wife it's her 30th birthday um i know we i was hoping for the roe v wade decision today as well i think the supreme court had like six opinions that they dropped but no nothing on dobbs yet that's the case so we'll see but there were tons of abortion protesters out there though screaming and being topless it's the same group if you see green and you see the abortion stuff that's rise up for abortion they're the ones that have been going topless and running around wnba games and like screaming stuff breaking into churches it's just weird so they're also like just in their underwear and like free bleeding or pretending to be free bleeding like it's like these people are crazy random idea you should make merch that says don't go touch grass i should i think it'd be funny let's see eli says i'm producing a documentary with kfc to find out what a chicken is good there we go time to partner with matt love it uh i live in the same county's fountain hood and our rodeos are super fun and we really pay tribute to our military i love that yeah that's my favorite part about all of it it's usually super pro america very patriotic makes me feel good oh i love everybody saying happy birthday yay good i'm happy uh bread versus gina would be over as quick as the fight from oh brother listen here's the thing i did brazilian jiu jitsu for about eight years and i even taught for a bit but i haven't in three or so so i'm definitely out of shape but i do have my some of my techniques still but i have the elbows i actually said that in a tick tock last night because one of our things on the red carpet was like what would you use to fight gina and i was like i got these babies and some knees um but that's usually for like fighting a man that's bigger than you like gina's about my height maybe a little shorter so i really don't know but she would knock me out like i would just run i would de-escalate the situation be like gina remember we're just sisters we don't need to fight uh nh nh are rules all the states uh i've never been to new hampshire but i know people love it uh first time catching you live keep the great work thanks y'all i appreciate it homeschool not watching tv and pop culture is why you aren't a blue haired weirdo like most gen z right now equals facts you know i do like i make fun of myself for you know shelter whatever and i really don't think i'm sheltered i had a ton of independence when i was younger i was sheltered from not sheltered but i was oblivious to a lot of pop culture things a lot of references that i kind of didn't really like when i was you know younger because i felt like i was missing out on some stuff but the stuff that i was focusing on that i and i was working on i feel like are far more important you know i started working at a very young age i was volunteering at a young age i read you know i don't i don't know if i will ever get back to reading as much as i did growing up because i was that was basically my entire education was reading literally like three books a week um and so i feel like i had a very very strong and solid foundation philosophically and morally um through all of that so i wouldn't change it for the world but it does make it so that i am sometimes oblivious to a lot of things but you know what it's fine we're here i'm not a blue haired liberal i'm hanging out with y'all so apparently i did something right my mom did something right she's probably watching the stream right now so hey mom i love you um hey will you interview taylor silverman the quartering is a company um let's see i am at the god king of truth social willing to sell to jeremy oh you're wanting to sell your thing to jeremy uh that's funny i'm not sure who taylor silverman is but i will check uh him or her out uh harvey thank you and then i wish you guys had work from home jobs yes i know uh we are a uh a very pro working in person company it's an important part of our culture so we do not have any sadly cushy remote jobs um but if you guys are in the nashville area if you do anything in media entertainment news anything digital marketing whatever what the thumbnails if you do graphic stuff creative i think we have some legal jobs maybe that sort of thing you can go to uh daily wire careers or daily wire hr you can also check us out on linkedin and i mean seriously there is a labor shortage right now and we are looking for very very good talent because we are growing so fast and uh people it's a it's a great company to work for because it's very mission driven so that'll be that's the way that i'll end this stream i'll make hr very happy today by doing this plug so do go check us out on linkedin uh we are i think growing our presence there which is actually fun it's been buzz around the office so go check out those jobs if you are in any of those industries or want to merge into you know daily wire and you would be willing to move to nashville it's a great company so i'll leave you with that um and let's see uh texas texas we love our state more than the us love that we'll leave it with that um all right guys i appreciate y'all being here um and thank you again to jeremy the quartering for coming on and chatting um swatting is a very very serious issue and i think we kind of got sadly a little bit desensitized um with it and uneducated when it came to you know tim because it's been happening so much that i feel like it's like oh my god okay it's happening again whatever but it is really serious it does put people's life at risk and it shows you know what people hiding behind their screens really have the power to do so anyway i'm glad that he was here and able to share that story love him go check out his stuff go buy his coffee it'll be great um but all right guys have a great rest of your wednesday i will see you tomorrow comment section episode coming out tonight you will have one in the morning we're doing a new posting schedule so i don't know if you guys will like that better or not we'll see but anyway i see sheller ready to click and stream i'm going to drag it out as long as possible wait before before we do this i'm going to make you hold on there a little longer my last anecdote for the day my crusty white dog no no no no did it die oh my god no no um so you guys i've told you sorry i'm holding this on a little i have basically four minutes until like i told i said i was streaming for an hour hold on um you the the the labor shortage is impacting dog groomers as well we talked about this when you have a crusty white dog they need to be groomed quite frequently because even if you're brushing them out their hair gets so long and it just gets in their face and it's matted and it's getting so humid and gross here i had to do something about it literally could not get her in to be groomed until august 5th that is when i was able to make an appointment i was like fine i'll go ahead and take the august 5th appointment but what am i going to do now it's like june i bought a grooming kit and i tried yesterday and that will never see because you i the point of all this is that you guys have been saying will you please bring rocky the crusty white dog onto student episode no she looks worse than she's ever looked before but you know what she has a short hair cut she is thriving for the summer she's gonna get a tan hot girl crusty white dog summer but i just did want to say this on live a public apology to my dog for doing that to her i'm actually going to go home today and like try to clean up some of it like because i feel like some parts are uneven but the good thing is now she's not like sweating um i really just wanted to say this live so that i could see sheller's face and he looks horrified so anyway krusty doggo anyway shave her yes i know guys i know somebody says krusty dogs is a real issue but she's so sweet she is a bit of a freak i will say she's like a crazy crazy maniac dog especially when she was a puppy i there was a point where i was like i don't know if i can even handle you but she's grown to be very kind like when we were when i was grooming her she just like laid there and let me do it so you know what this is the one time that maybe grooming was this is the only time that i'll use the word grooming in a positive light even though it turned out terribly anyway y'all that is actually the end thank you for sticking with me with my extra anecdote you guys are awesome have a wonderful rest of your wednesday see you tomorrow be a great time all right bye thanks shower", "oWPtKceC3e8": "okay this is the fatness spectrum

comments section i'm brett cooper yesterday we talked about the new live-action remake of the little mermaid obviously there's an internet firestorm about that movie but since everybody has been focusing on that film there is another disney live action remake another one that they released this week that has slid under the radar and i don't think it should because we need to talk about this because disney is not creative and they are objectively terrible these days i actually had no idea that this was going on that as you all know my best friend is madison she sent me a text last night and went oh my god these people are literally insane you have to talk about this so thank you madison i love you she's probably gonna be watching this episode tomorrow at work while she crunches numbers so there's your shout out but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification bell so you never miss a comment section episode and of course you can go to dailywire.com brett to check out the first capsule of my merch collection this live-action disney film is pinocchio and it stars tom hanks america's dad who i hate that he is so idiotic and political because i do love him every movie he does just feels like a warm fuzzy hug but not this one not at all it honestly is kind of a stretch calling it live action because other than tom hanks's character of the toy maker basically every character is cgi and arguably not great cgi this kind of seems to be a common thread over disney plus things right now because just a couple weeks ago we were talking about she-hulk and how everybody was ripping it to shreds about its cgi and now everybody is pissed off about pinocchio but for good reason after lunch can i whip you nope oh no fear ow here is a few clips from the film because i just need to give you a taste because literally nobody is happy about this film like not a single soul here you go why he is a natural-born actor right gideon and not just an actor an entrepreneur and won't your father be proud in this clip honest john the fox is telling pinocchio that he's a natural-born actor an influencer we are talking about a timeless disney animated classic and they have absolutely destroyed it immediately within one clip because they are telling pinocchio that he needs to be an influencer well i'm out of here goodbye everyone but i'm sorry pinocchio you cannot be an influencer unless your ad segways are as slick as mine which feels like the perfect time to tell you guys about good ranchers good ranchers is my favorite meat delivery service and they are 100 american made all of their products are born raised and harvested right here in the united states and their quality is literally unbeatable their beef is all pasteurized in either usda prime or upper choice their chicken has no added hormones or any of that gross processed crap and all of their seafood is caught fresh and flash frozen so that you get the best quality delivered to your door if you want to check them out go to goodranchers.com cooper and then use promo code cooper at checkout for 30 off of your order plus free shipping again that is goodranchers.com cooper promo code cooper you will not regret it you can make a steak while you cringe at this pinocchio film well while you cringe at basically anything that disney is putting out right now i loved that line where he was like your father would be so proud no somebody commented and said any reasonable father would yeet their child out of the window if some random stranger said that they'd make a great influencer yeah well the thing is do we have reasonable fathers these days does anybody have a dad i didn't usually which is maybe why i became an actor i'm just kidding i loved being an actor but it is true in the early 2000s people would tell all these stories like jennifer lawrence she was discovered in times square in new york city and somebody came up to her and was like i think you should be a model like that is creepy bad touch bad touch stranger danger thank god that didn't happen to me i literally asked my mom if i could go and you know be in musicals and i wanted to act but the thought of some adult looking at kids being like oh you'd be great in commercials like no that's disgusting and disney you are feeding into that you pedophile here's another clip from it that is also just cringe we need a simple strong stage name slab oakley chad log whoo i've got it chris pine i one okay this is just a pet peeve of mine i hate period pieces or like timeless classics when they try to semi-modernize them like there was a new adaptation of jane austen's persuasion that was on netflix i loved jane austen and they utterly destroyed it because they had lines and they're like oh my ex like i hate being single i'm sorry people in the region sierra did not say my ex-boyfriend no stop trying to make it relatable to people stop dumbing down content just to appeal to our you know current trends and culture it's not helping our society at all it is literally making us idiots i don't want to hear about chris pine in pinocchio not in the slightest or chad stop talking about chads it's pinocchio guys here's the vfx the scene i don't even know what's going on in the scene because it just looks so awful look at this look what is that is that a green screen it is like i can't even watch this anymore this is like a freshman student in film school is making their first short film and they have access to a studio and a green screen and maybe like an animal mask and this is what they create like that is obviously a green screen like is that even vfx cgi stuff no that looks like they took an animal head from a furry convention and put it on this dude like disney be better you've gotta do better if you have no money to hire more vfx artists or to take more time to make it look good then maybe you should you know take a step back pause the terrible remakes and think hey maybe i should make some films that people actually want to watch people actually want to go out and support because i'm not paying money to see this and i don't think anybody else is they also are just making this film a disney love fest you remember in the original pinocchio there's that scene in like the wood shop where all of the toys are popping out and it's like really beautiful and it's all these really really cute toys well this time it's just disney why i don't need to see woody from toy story donald duck maleficent like why dumbo who thought that that was a good idea okay the dwarves are actually kind of cute i will say they just want to make themselves feel better about things i don't know who is approving these somebody said you know this all might be a wonderful metaphor for disney's relationship to their own ip today every classic disney movie is now a mechanical cuckoo clock designed to repeat itself over and over until it drives you insane literally yes he's got a point this is the person that is posting all of these clips and i i love his commentary because it is so sharp and so savage and just calling i don't even know what his politics are i don't know if i agree with him on anything but he is calling disney out on the fact that they are infiltrating people's minds dumbing them down creating content that is not intelligent or creative in the slightest and thinking that our society is just gonna go along with it because we're just little mechanical content absorbing beings be better than that like think critically about the content that you are consuming there's a reason why i don't go beyond the clips because i don't want this garbage in my brain so i appreciate you all being here but also with other content you know think critically nobody is happy one person said i'm just so tired a film industry that so shamelessly makes product content instead of art is dead long before it inevitably fails i've never felt so sure that hollywood needs to just stop existing had a good run shut it all down go home artistic null and creative void again i don't even know what this person's politics are but people are like all of this content is soulless entertainment in hollywood and art used to be about telling incredible stories and making people feel things this content just makes me feel angry whoa this is worthless that's not what i want um somebody said i must be high as [\u00a0__\u00a0] right now this is not real no this is real life we are all living in a fever dream somebody said i am not prepared for the uprising of horny furries that this movie will provoke that makes me uncomfortable you know what it's probably true because people these days take everything at face value and if they see a weird donkey in pinocchio they'll be like oh my god i identify as donkey donkey self no you don't but what i do love is that people even on the far left are pissed off and these are the people that defend disney and their you know not so secret gay agenda and their terrible content to the death this is an article um from mashable that came out yesterday and it says the one song lyric pinocchio should have run past someone anyone and then the subtitle is this is good to go everyone's fine with it okay so they are talking about a song of the coachmen to pleasure island which is sung by luke evans who actually also played gaston in beauty and the beast so he has been brought back and he is playing this character in pinocchio and the song is supposed to warn kids about peer pressure and temptation and vice because obviously the original folk tales the original disney animated films they were all supposed to teach kids you know good values help them learn obviously they are learning terrible values these days from these films but this is what the original intent of the song was and this is the line that people are having a problem with i'm gonna have him sing it to you [Music] that's it it is literally uh how many seconds nine seconds is what is making people feel so triggered and offended the line is real boys always want more and real girls always like the real boys more that was a ripoff this article just rips into the film which i appreciate because obviously i think this person is an idiot but i also don't like the film so i'm very conflicted at the moment but it's just ridiculous we have to read it the second line real girls always like the real boys more is sung by girls on the cart are they brainwashed according to this song real girls prefer the real boys who always want more this complete nonsense is blatant promotion of gender roles and compulsory heterosexuality feminist adrian rich's concept that our culture always steers us to see any connection between men and women girls and boys as romantically inclined well because usually it is that's just biology for you i'm sorry to disrupt your feminist ideas um plus it's worth pointing out that the restricted cisgender binary here and the lack of acknowledgement for non-binary transgender or gender non-conforming kids an inclusion of whom would have been an awesome move for disney in a film that actually takes pain to determine real boys by their bravery honesty and altruism so maybe i might actually like this film because they are being based and talking about real men when i talk about masculinity and bringing back real men i'm not just talking about like big beefy bodybuilders whatever no i'm talking about your values some of that is bravery and honesty so i'm sorry that the far left has such a problem with good values but they have no moral compass we already know that yes all of these kids get their comeuppance for bowing to peer pressure but the coachman notably does not however in a time when speaking out against misogyny and working to dismantle systems of oppression must be prioritized even from an early age why did disney think that an entitled sexist lyric like this would be fine yes this song is sung by a villain so it is meant to demonstrate the most putrid of opinions not to be taken as a one's own i assume it had lofty poor unfortunate souls ambition but distinguishing between the villains dubious song lyrics and the overarching message of the film seems a bit of an ask for kids who tend to take things literally more often than not i'm sorry i think you're changing the narrative here because the left has been screaming at me for the last two years that kids are intelligent to understand uh non-binary you know gender ideologies they're actually able to understand sexuality starting in preschool which is why preschool teachers talk about sexuality and how they are attracted to women or men or nobody or maybe a fish but now you're saying the kids are stupid and that they cannot distinguish reality from imagination like you cannot have it both ways this is a classic leftist tactic we have talked about so many times now where they will scream at us for months for years about an objective truth and now if we don't support the subjective truth that we are bigots that we are awful or racist whatever they want to call us but then the moment that they have some new current thing some shiny little societal problem that they want to chase they will immediately abandon that objective truth completely flip it on its head and start chasing after that and then they turn around and say that we are the idiots and that we are the hypocrites no you are because you are so valueless you have no foundation you have no principles that is the issue here guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "YqkaXMhPPyI": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper today we are going to talk about Candace Cameron Burr she was on Full House for many years and she came back and did Fuller house she is a known conservative and Christian in Hollywood which means that a lot of people hate her she has become very well known for her Hallmark movies and now she is back in the news irritating leftists for making some controversial political statements but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com to check out my merch collection this week Candace who is the chief creative officer for the Great American Family gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal and they all got hung up on one thing that Candace said here's a Variety article about it they said Candace Cameron Burr says the Great American family will not prioritize gay couples and will focus on traditional marriage instead and that is a pretty mild headline some of the other ones where Candace Cameron Burr will not include lgbtq people in any of her new films uh Candace Cameron Burr suppresses lgbtq voices Kansas game reverse says no gay in her new I mean just like really outrageous stuff let's actually look at the quotes that she gave the Wall Street Journal this is her just kind of introducing the production company as a whole for some context for you guys she said my heart wants to tell stories that have more meaning and purpose and depth behind them thank God somebody does and she said I knew that people behind the Great American family were Christians that loved the Lord and wanted to promote Faith programming and good family entertainment which we desperately need right now whether you are a Christian or not we need wholesome entertainment dear God please this is a quote that everybody got hung up on and it is in response to the interviewer who was asking about Hallmark introducing their first gay couple in one of their Christmas movies and Candace says this I think that the Great American family will keep traditional marriage at the core and then the CEO added it is certainly the year 2022 so we are aware of the trends there is no white board that says yes this or no we will never go here both she and Bill Abbott who is the CEO agreed right after that quote that as the company grows they want to move into celebrating other religions and other genres and they do not want to just focus on this little niche that they have created but they just do not have the finances or the development team to do that yet so they are focusing on what the two of them believe in and what their values are and the internet lost its damn mind over her saying we're going to focus on traditional marriage and have that at the core somebody tweeted out and said I just have to comment thank you so glad to have you our contribution here sir Candace Cameron Burr left the Hallmark Channel because they started to feature gay people and she started her own network for the sole purpose of excluding gay people there really is no hate like Christian love okay okay somebody else said I started to hate Hallmark movies because of the traditional marriage couple story template good for you another person said it's really disappointing to see that Candace Cameron Burr grew up to be such a homophobic being next to the amazing Bob Saget for all of those years did nothing to make her a decent human what a shame which is funny because Bob Saget is literally friends with tons of conservatives including Dave Rubin they were like really really tight friends and was always friends with Cameron so obviously Bob Saget is better than all of you people because he actually had love and tolerance anyway moving on somebody else says just your daily reminder that Candace Cameron Burr is a homophobic piece of classic another person said Candace Cameron Burr is another simple minded talentless bigot who causes more hurt than she does joy politely go yourself Candace I certainly hope we never have to come face to face hashtag lgbtq and then this one Meredith says Candace Cameron bursts comments regarding the lgbtq plus Community are not opinions me saying that raisins are disgusting and tastes like cow turd that's an opinion not wanting to see gay people find love in a TV movie because you feel like they have some sort of agenda makes you an okay Meredith you want to talk about agendas that's fine let's be consistent here is a Variety article that was put out about the same times Candace's Gabrielle Union and Ava Longoria developing an lgbtq wedding comedy about dueling mothers-in-law explain exclusive well they're certainly open about the type of relationship that they want to portray this movie they are explicitly saying we are going to put gay marriage at the center of this film companies and institutions having a political agenda is not new we talk about that every single day we are allowed to do that as well that's why companies like nimi skin care are so incredible because they are Unapologetic in the things that they believe Mimi is a brand that actually supports true biological and real femininity faith and Country and family values and they actively stand against cancer culture and wokeness but on top of all of that their products are actually incredible and they truly work I have been using nimi since January of this year they have truly transformed my skin I do a little combination of their hydrate and protect bundle and their daily glow up routine I love that they have those options because it takes the confusion out of trying to figure out what skin care works for you they'll just send you a whole bundle they'll tell you what to do it is really perfect if you want to try them out go to nimiskincare.com use promo code

films and you will be the most American Family Values person out there it's awesome and here's another this is also from variety let's just stay consistent on the messaging from this publication he said Billy Eichner on all Queer Bros cast we are trying to correct an imbalance now this recent movie which we talked about in an episode not long ago has an entirely lgbtq cast and they went into it wanting in all gay cast that's what they achieved it was a huge selling point on the movie is that an agenda are you excluding people Meredith and now let's look at the new diversity requirements from The Academy of motion pictures that were rolled out in 2020 they are slowly being implemented in by 2024 this will be like the norm a lot of other film festivals uh have also adopted the sort of diversity requirements but here's the announcement Academy establishes representation and inclusion standards for Oscar's eligibility so if you want your film to be eligible to win an Oscar or any of these other big Awards you have to hit diversity quotas so when we talk about Hollywood literally being contrived these days you have to force your art to fit into these little intersectionality boxes that's not just some farce this is actually happening in order to qualify for an Oscar you have to meet two out of the four of the following standard to be deemed eligible the first one is on-screen representation themes and narrative so you have to have like some minority as a leader supporting actor the general ensemble cast has to be 30 percent minority the main storyline subject matter has to have a person with a cognitive or physical disability lgbtq personal racial or ethnic group or women standard B is the creative leadership and project team they want to make sure that you're having diversity in the people behind the film then there's all of those things as well standard C industry access and opportunities to people who are interns on your show the Pas the people behind the scenes then the last one the audience development uh you have to be woke in how you distribute and Market the film and how you get financing even you have to hit at least two of those four quotas it is ridiculous and when this came out in 2020 that was like the kicker for me knowing that I just didn't think I wanted to work in traditional Hollywood anymore I was like you've got like okay first the vaccine stuff and this so obviously there is a clear agenda in Hollywood and apparently that is okay but whatever Candace Cameron Burr is doing is apparently not and she's a bigot because having a political agenda in Hollywood is not new excluding types of people and pushing another group of people is not new but they only dislike it when it's something that they disagree with and celebrities are already commenting about this whole debacle most notably Jojo siwa Jojo siwa and Candace got into a spat back in the summer because JoJo did a Tick-Tock Trend where you have to be like who's the best celebrity you've ever met who's the rudest celebrity you've ever met you like flash your phone and people screenshotted the rudest celebrity and it ended up being Candace Cameron Burr it was a ridiculous thing it was because Candace was too busy to take a picture with her when JoJo was like six years old it was a whole ordeal I made an episode about it you can go watch but they kissed and made up basically it was all very cordial they had a whole phone conversation you know made up and Candace was like I'm so sorry anyway but JoJo who is I think she's 18 now and she is lesbian now hates her again and this is her most recent post on Instagram here's another ridiculous headline Candace Cameron burst plans for new cable channel no gays so stupid and JoJo siwa said honestly I can't believe after everything that went down just a few months ago that she would not only create a movie with the intention of excluding lgbtqia plus but then also talk about it in the press this is rude and hurtful to a whole new community of people rude and hurtful is a callback from the summer because the trend she was doing it like flash up on the screen and she said who's the most rude and hurtful celebrity you've ever met she flashed that whole social media thing context is important anyway all of the blue checks in her comment section were quaking look at all of these like you know I love you that's from Jody Sweetin another Full House person Maddie Ziegler go off JoJo all these other people that's a no from me this is the only way that she can stay relevant so ready to take her down this person said this almost feels like fake news LOL like what yes Jessica it is fake new she didn't say no gay look that was literally not even part of the quote she is just saying that she is putting her beliefs at the center of her films that she is financing that she is promoting God forbid she do that then anyway I started scrolling past all the pinned comments in the blue checks and I realized thankfully that other people actually had common sense look at this I'm gay but she has her beliefs and there ain't nothing wrong with that y'all are easily offended that has almost 2 000 likes somebody said yes how dare Christians stand up for their values would you say the same thing if a Muslim did this note you would praise them somebody else said she can have her beliefs the same way you have yours rude and hurtful to a whole Community you are doing the same thing to the community that shares her beliefs this was obnoxious and there are so many more I was so excited like thankfully some people still have rationality and can think critically about the situation everybody just needs to have some damn consistency like if you are going to have an agenda the other side can too it is totally fine Candace and her new production company they're not suppressing anybody else's voices she is just making content that aligns with her values just like the rest of Hollywood is doing literally every single day so calm down and go touch grass okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "TCVt8PsG0Mo": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper guys I have a very special guest today welcome Tulsi thank you so much for being here thank you Brett it is awesome to be here I've been looking forward to talking to you love the work that you're doing thank you it was very fun we were sitting in here and makeup prior to this and I got to face time with her husband big fan he's a big fan very fun I was fangirling he texted me after he's like honey I look like a caveman I was like no you're an artist you're allowed to look I appreciate creative as you want yeah if you guys did know her husband is a cinematographer he is and so if you see her beautiful videos and it's it's fair it's a power couple for sure obviously if you guys watch my show you saw the video I did last week about Tulsi because she has officially left the Democrat Party yes it's very exciting and you are just incredibly Brave we were talking about this a little bit earlier but I think you're giving people a lot of Hope and courage to be able to walk away from something that they've been aligned with prior to the craziness that we're living in right now could you talk a little bit about that and what you've experienced after the fact I really didn't know how people would react I knew I knew that the same criticisms that I've been getting for quite some time because I have been speaking the truth and been critical of the Democrat Party now for years even when I was in Congress even at some would say great expense to my so-called political career which has never been a thing so I I got a lot of those expected criticisms from the same people that have been uh trying to get rid of me for a while but the thing that really inspired hope um and and made me really happy was how many people I've been hearing from some who I know others who are just total strangers as people from across the country sending me DMS on Twitter Instagram or emails or LinkedIn or whatever I'm still trying to figure out how to use LinkedIn by the way but exactly but but people expressing gratitude that they feel heard they feel understood they feel that the things that they've been concerned about in their frustrations that they've been feeling are now being heard because I've provided that voice it's been very heartening to get those kinds of of comments and that feedback I've been traveling through a lot of different states campaigning for candidates over the last week and getting that same kind of feedback in person and the reason why I feel hopeful because of that is because especially as we head into this election that's a super important election where if we are unhappy with the way things are the best way and the most immediate way that we can make that change is by casting our votes and bringing people into Power who put country first who put the American people first who aren't going to bow to the wishes of the powers that be in the swamp of Washington so we can turn these concerns into action and I think I hope that there are a lot of people across the country who are will do just that I love that now on top of just casting your vote what advice do you have for people who might have been in your position that you were prior to last week prior to walking away what advice do you have for them to get courage to speak out to do it if you're concerned about the attempts to take away our right to free speech if you're concerned about the kind of censorship that's happening from our government working with big Tech if you're concerned about attacks on our freedom of religion with people in government the Democrat Party being openly hostile towards people of faith and spirituality if you're concerned about increasing attempts to undermine our Second Amendment rights all of these things if you're concerned about open borders about Rising crime in our communities about inflation know that you're not alone even though they make us feel like you know we're Fringe or were whatever you're not alone and now is the time that if we value these freedoms we have to exercise them and we can best do that by using our voice and it may be as something as little as going through your phone and finding people maybe haven't talked to in a little while and talking about what's important to you and and who you're voting for and why you're voting for them I think a lot of people have more influence than they realize because I hear from people all the time like hey I don't have a podcast I don't have a show I don't have a platform how can I as just one person make a difference I tell them go through your phone I guarantee you there you got a lot of people in your phone that you can connect with and whether they end up agreeing or disagreeing is kind of not the point start the conversation because I guarantee you'll give them something to think about and hopefully that will spur them to also speak up it's also just such a great exercise for yourself to begin those conversations to strengthen your own principles to strengthen your opinions and your ideas because you won't know whether they can hold until you begin you know talking to people who disagree with you and be pushed and that is so important and that's one reason why I'm very grateful that I did you know go to a university and I was in a very leftist college system because it forced me to you know stand strong and become very confident in those and a lot of people are like well I'm not yet I'm not you can start small the other thing I've always said in addition to of course voting and doing that is just leading by example you don't have to have a podcast exactly but leading a good life being as authentic as you are being as honest and is brave just even in your personal life they hate when you're revealed exactly they like they like to paint us as angry radicals or people who are who are causing harm to others by speaking the truth and that's what I encourage people as well is You can disagree with someone without belittling them or calling them names or making them feel like they're worthless which frankly is what it is a clear tactic that the Democrat Party uses and it's effective it is effective and it creates this culture of fear have those discussions if you end up with somebody that you disagree with you can do so without becoming disagreeable without name calling but still holding strong to your principles and and the truth we actually have a perfect example of this because as you know we read the comments on the show which everybody else hey dates doing so I do it for everybody that's good we have probably my very favorite video clip with you ever which is during the presidential debates that one and this is a perfect example of asking a question in a simplistic yet very intentional way and just watching somebody else falter because you did not look disagreeable you looked and tell anyway so we're gonna watch if you guys have not seen it you're in for a treat so here we go Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president but I love that she already looks so uncomfortable yeah there are too many examples to cite but she put over 1500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana facts she's the perfect example of somebody who's just utterly disagreeable all the time I asked her to do so I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people which became a national model for the work that needs to be done and I am proud of that work and I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor but actually doing the work it is so good and it is so just succinct you were just stating facts and she had no response other than laughing and immediately turning and belittling you for giving a fancy speech and that's all that was all that she had and saying she was proud and in in the post-debate interview that she did the first interview that she I think it was with CNN they questioned her on this that interaction and said you know what do you have to say and she said oh well something along the lines but I'm not going to dignify someone who's pulling so low with the response that right there epitomizes the arrogance and that condescending attitude because like I don't care what she thinks about me that exchange right there was for them American people yeah and for voters to say okay you know this person wants to be your president this is the record she says she's proud of answer for it that's it and instead of doing that and actually responding to the facts that I put forward her response is like uh Tulsi is too little for me to dignify with the response which really is the American people are too little for me to dignify yeah they don't deserve to know the truth they don't deserve to know anything because of course I know best and the thing with that too that surprised me was how unprepared she was and it was because no other candidate in that campaign dared challenged her no reporter dared asked her those very simple questions that are easily googleable on her record and that points to the bigger issue of of the problem with our election system and our politics today is for-profit Corporate media colluding with the leaders of the party to say okay here's the candidates that we like that we want voters to hear from here's the other ones that we don't let's like just silence them which just takes away the right of Voters to ask actually make a truly informed decision on the options that they have before that yeah because they have no idea yeah well very positive note because as you know I read a lot of comments at the time of doing this show and just looking at comments because I'm a Serial comment reader I have never seen a comment section on any video or any post that is unanimously so positive and so unanimously in your favor I am not kidding I mean every single one from both sides of political aisle somebody said this isn't Democrat versus Republican this is good versus evil until she is a damn Patriot why is CNN show in the live execution somebody else said it has been an awful few years for politics and Society in general it is nice to know that there are people like Tulsi out there who principled and actually care about people I'm not a Democrat but if they're somebody who would rival trump it would be Tulsi the Democrats don't deserve this wonderful woman I love how she always says let's be very clear about this and decides to not be clear if that's just about every single one there was not a single one that was in favor of Kamala because people are craving common sense and they crave authenticity and you're offering it to people and regardless of how you feel about policy having somebody like you come forward and say I'm done with it and I care about transparency it is just huge so thank you very very grateful to have you I hope more people do the same I yes exactly and I think so and I'm actually very proud of the audience of this show too because it's incredibly ideologically diverse good we have a lot of people who are very similar to you and that they've walked away or they're just fed up and like I'm still a Democrat but I feel like there's not a home for me yeah so I try to be a home of common sense that is exactly the place that we should all feel at home and I that's why I hate you know different people say oh where do you fit in what's the label that applies to you it's like none of them do yeah and I think most people feel that way like sick and tired of the labels because one word the word Progressive the word conservative the definitions of that will differ depending on who you talk to some people might say one thing or another thing on a whole spectrum of things and really what matters the most is the truth exactly Common Sense freedom and these are the things that even as we may have policy differences on different issues which is fine and it's great those exactly that's that's life yeah if we can live in this space of just like let's be real let's talk straight and get away from the tribal attitude that makes it so that conservatives can't criticize other conservatives yes you know Democrats can't yeah criticize it's incredibly important to be able to hold your own party your own Community accountable and we've gotten into this place where everybody is like a protected class yeah and that should not be how it is and so you are doing incredible work thank you so I'm so happy to have you on the show guys if you are not following her and if you have not checked out her new podcast go do so she also had an incredible episode with Joe Rogan recently where she goes in depth about the impending possibility of nuclear war and don't listen to it before you go to bed no exactly but she hits on some incredibly important topics and it is necessary listening so thank you again for being on the show so happy to be here thank you so much for what you do of course guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "54znzWJVWmI": "[Music] so apparently there's a trend going around on tick tock where you find slurs for white people because in order to be politically correct and anti-racist you must be racist to another group of people it is the most backwards way of thinking i've ever seen but i'm glad to know that people think of me as ranch pudding and the mayo monkey so that's how you want to play it huh well as a british person i have the ultimate slur for pretty much everyone easily colonized yeah but you got your ass whooped by us sir somebody else said they didn't even say vanilla gorilla which is my favorite also did you hear that person that said discharge demon ew these people are filthy", "Gj-rEwHjpZA": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper guys this is not really in the nature of the show we usually try to keep things pretty light-hearted and we find the humor in things however i don't think i would be genuine if i did not at least briefly touch on the fact that there was a shooting yesterday that happened in texas where i believe the numbers up to 19 children were killed it was a horrific tragedy and yet we are already seeing people on both sides of the political aisle politicize it for their own opportunity to either push gun control or to dunk on the media whatever it may be this was a terrible atrocity and my heart goes out to the parents who are receiving phone calls that parents should never have to ever receive and i hope that they get the space and the support that they need but knowing our current political and cultural landscape sadly that probably is not the case because everybody just wants cheap political grabs i mean just like look at the corporate world look at any huge institution they take these tragedies they take these monumental events and they twist them and exploit them so that they can use them for their own benefit this is nothing new we see how the media exploits these situations and then how the big corporations and institutions who ultimately align with this mainstream narrative with these political grabs they jump on board and basically exploit these situations for their own benefit and it's never more clear than when they do it with social justice warrior causes so today i thought that we could look at a few of the most recent cringe corporate takes because you know there is never a lack of them they are always coming in but sometimes it feels like there's just too many to choose from but this week there have been a couple really good ones first of all i saw this tweet this account said nah i don't want to hear any juneteenth complaints eat that walmart ice cream like the man want you to and then posted a picture of the juneteenth celebration edition ice cream from great value at walmart it's swirled red velvet and cheesecake flavored ice cream and on the back it has a story and it says share and celebrate african-american culture emancipation and enduring hope through your red velvet cheesecake ice cream people were pressed somebody said it probably has something in it that may not affect you right away but later on you may wind up with something that could send you to the hospital for some more poison this ice cream was not the only juneteenth item that walmart put on their shelves just look at this tick tock apparently walmart has great value juneteenth celebration edition ice cream swirled red velvet and cheesecake flavored ice cream this is what happens when you commercialize federal holidays there's all type of juneteenth party supplies juneteenth wine you got the little mask and glasses of course their celebrate juneteenth shirts they got juneteenth water bottle big dot happiness june teen freedom day party okay also look at this t-shirt here it's a white woman wearing the june teeth shirt anti-racism if you are not being actively anti-racist you are a bigot and a racist walmart is just ahead of the curve my friends okay by the way continue they also got a congrats officer banner in between the june team stuff walmart y'all got to know the police and the blacks and celebration june teams later it's not the best and i'm so upset about this what i need walmart to do is send me all this ice cream just so i could taste it and make sure it is wrong i actually really like this guy's attitude about it he's not pressed he's just you know calling out the fact that this is ridiculous why does walmart need to have some kind of big corporate statement about juneteenth it's too much guys it's too much anyway walmart received so much backlash on social media that they are removing all of the products they released a statement and they said we thought that we were doing a good thing but apparently we were insensitive people were calling out the facts that the execs at walmart are all white and middle america type people and so they shouldn't be the ones putting out juneteenth content or whatever so they're removing this cheesecake and red velvet ice cream which is disappointing because i would have i might have supported it i could have it sounds delicious i would go get it overall i'm slightly confused about the backlash from the left because like y'all fought for this to be a national holiday when pride month comes around most people are cheering like for the corporate activism like yay disney now has pride children's clothing and target has the pride section this is great what's wrong with walmart doing it like yes it's cringe but at this point it's very normal are you guys just like not comfortable with corporate cringe for juneteenth yet or is it just are we all walking away from corporate activism just in general i really don't know the consensus but it's a bit hypocritical maybe it's because pride is in june like you can't have two overlapping social justice warrior events in one month the corporations have to pick one uh i choose sandwich again disappointing because i think i would have enjoyed some 9.99 juneteenth wine on the other side of the spectrum new york post put this out yesterday kim kardashian was named beyond meat's chief taste consultant somebody responded and said new york post is now the onion and then somebody replied and said more like life has become the onion news except the onion is so progressive these days if you really want good satire you have to go to babylon b like these people you're behind the times the onion is out of touch here is the video that kim kardashian posted to announce the news i believe so much in the mission of beyond me that i've stepped in to help with my greatest asset my taste this plant-based meat is not only amazingly delicious but it's also better for you and better for the planet it's a simple change that makes a really big difference and now that i'm beyond meets chief taste consultant there's never been a better time to go beyond i love the like sexualization of plant-based meat like her standing there in her like very dramatic whatever like beyond meat my soy chicken nuggets we know that they're not that good also i think it was impossible burger this is not beyond i don't know if they overlap but impossible burger there was all of this stuff because the main ingredient that is in roundup was found in a bunch of impossible burger products saying that the soy-based products and all the processed food is like actually better for you straight up lie so just stop lying to yourself because we all know that it does not taste good but if you actually want to try some good meat you need to try good ranchers did you know that 85 of grass-fed meat that you see in stores and grocery stores is all imported from overseas why are we paying a premium for foreign meat when you could be getting american raised grass-fed beef delivered straight to your door from good ranchers it is delicious you can get beef you can get chicken you can get stuff with marinades it's incredible so if you want to try them out go to goodranchers.com and use code cooper and you will get two pounds of american wagyu burgers totally free plus free shipping on us and then you can go pick out everything else that you want because it's all real meat and i promise it's better than the stuff kim kardashian is peddling actually good ranchers you should make me your chief taste consultant that i'm just floating that idea so i know you're watching this i'm ready for the job this is really just a tactful play by beyond meat because their stocks have dropped 80 percent in the last year and according to analysts they've been desperate for a wall street rebranding apparently they're rebranding with kim k and they're thinking that this influencer is going to make everybody you know jump for joy for soy meat it sort of gives me hope because if their stocks are plummeting it probably means people are waking up to the fact that pumping your body full of roundup pesticides and fake plant-based things aren't really good for you if you're gonna eat plant-based eat plant-based not whatever this is silent green is people i just loved the internet's reaction to this somebody said they just keep finding new fake job titles to give celebs kim kardashian is now the chief taste consultant for beyond meat like okay babe me too isn't every consumer a chief taste consultant i can write a letter to any food company and be like this nasty they work for us basically somebody else said i would gladly be chief taste consultant for trader joe's that actually was me for five years because i was an employee for five years and i would just sit in the break room and try every single new product i have thoughts about basically everything that is on the shelves of trader joe's somebody else said kim k being named cheap taste consultant at beyond meat like we didn't see all her fashion choices before and after kanye yeah but i will say post kanye she's still doing all right i think that she's you know taken what he taught her he improved her taste drastically we all saw what she was wearing prior to kanye hopefully she'll fix beyond meat too or just run it into the ground either one is fine with me alright this last one probably the most triggering i think of the corporate ads i really don't even know how i can introduce this so let's just watch nature lets you be who you are even gay [Applause] ladies and gentlemens you are cordially invited to the summer of pride with my friends at the north face we're traveling all the gay across america and everyone's invited oh my god the earrings are carabiners side with us see you there besties apparently this is a new initiative from north face they're hosting summer of pride which is not just some video they are literally hosting events all across the country this summer where they have like hiking tours and panelists about like being gay in the wilderness or something like that i really don't know i went to the comments and right after it was posted there were a bunch of people calling on north face saying okay this is weird like i don't i don't need my outdoor wear to be gay like why are you doing this this is just strange also i think it's important to give some backstory as to who the drag queen is in the video the man that you see is the same person that is in drag he goes by patty gonia like patagonia patti gonia and he is a outdoor drag queen trying to querify outdoor activities basically and went viral a couple of years ago doing like tick-tocks and instagram things like he would be hiking in like full drag and that kind of thing and doing dances it was just interesting because i went to the comments right after it was posted just scrolling seeing if there was anything and almost everything i saw uh was people calling out north face and not being like hateful or anything but it was just saying okay this is a bit strange like why do we need drag queens in the north face like this just doesn't like where's the brand alignment this is odd i went back the next day those have all been deleted now it's just people saying like this is so incredible i love how like the north face is and they admitted that they're deleting comments somebody said if y'all are deleting comments you're not doing a good job listening smells like a loss of market share in here they respond and say hey alex we only remove comments that are racist discriminatory threatening abusive or harmful no they deleted a bunch of comments of people saying hey as a long time north face customer i don't really freaking like this this is strange those are the comments they're deleting somebody else said lololol yes sexualizing the outdoors is exactly what's going to inspire me to spend money on your products gay straight bi queer otherwise i don't want to know what's going on in your tent some things were meant to remain private politics and sexuality are two of those things you'd be wise to keep that in mind until then i will continue to share this post with everyone i know with the caption your q to quit shopping here at the north face somebody else threw some spice into the mix and said when will the north face do a straight summer to celebrate straight pride and norface responded and said plot twist straight pride is every day for real though queer people aren't as represented especially in the outdoors we're proud to support queer organizations year round to create a more inclusive environment like first of all i don't really know if they're right about that because these days the main people that i see wearing north face and patagonia and that sort of things are libs from seattle and portland i'm pretty sure they're the largest consumers of north face now since north face has become like a pop culture clothing brand i'm not upset about a gay man or a drag queen wearing north face or being outdoors like more people should be getting outside and touching grass like please get off your phones and go outside i am bothered in general that another company is just bowing to a woke narrative they're sacrificing its already pretty delicate reputation because north face went from being a highly respected brand of like the best outdoor apparel to literally being the company like i said the tech bros go and buy their beanies and their little puffer jackets so they can walk around seattle in them i don't care if my rain jackets and climbing gear is gay friendly i just want them to work i don't want to be climbing and have my carabiner crack open because now they're being designed as drag queen earrings so that's the thing that i'm concerned with the ad did sort of break my heart a little my dad used to work for north face uh he was in their finance department and we still have so many of their og products like they have never failed us once from like 20 25 years ago my family is pretty outdoorsy and the company was just like a huge part of my brothers growing up it like reminds me of when the boy scouts went woke where just kind of stings a little like it's just a huge part of your childhood and now i like look at your ass and you have drag queens parading around it's like is this really about camping or is it about social justice it's no longer about the consumer or about the products or the quality of the products it's literally just companies trying to align themselves with a progressive narrative they're just doing it so that they can check a box so that a very small one percent doesn't get angry at them and try to boycott them so it's a little depressing and it feels very inhumane and out of touch with reality but it's 2022 so what's new guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "gIraad4RrRw": "welcome

going on on the internet this weekend which i was actually very happy about because i feel like it was a time that we all you know should have been spending with loved ones and resting and sleeping like i did i slept a lot because we've had a very very busy month here but there was an interesting story that did come out of this weekend and i'm very excited to chat about it but before i get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already guys we hit 700k on friday and now we are almost to 730 000. it's wild you guys are crazy i'm loving it [Applause] the show goes on and then always ring that notification bell so you never miss a comment section episode you guys make this happen thank you so much for always being here i love doing the show i say this all the time but it's so much fun so thank you so have you guys heard of the new internet phenomenon bodega bro i thought not it's another story the jedi could tell you i was not up to speed on this at all until maybe yesterday but i kept seeing these memes of this absolute jabroni on twitter everybody was saying like justice for bodega bro here's what happened this guy i think his name is griffin but he is now known as bodega bro posted this video on tick tock so just moved to new york and i'm trying to go grocery shopping and so i type in like grocery stores and my apple maps and like everything you want to go to like i'm walking too like they're like this or like like this like bro it's not a grocery store like i'm trying to get like eggs yogurt like cheese like like that right hey yo let me get a bacon egg and cheese the aki way like you know those tick tocks like like where are the krogers and like the whole foods at like i'm about to eat like like cereal and ramen for dinner somebody found this on tiktok and posted it on twitter innocently you can see it here she just said y'all the original video is now private so we can't see it but it went viral and people lost their damn mind now of course there were some people that were laughing going oh yeah that's new york for you you know melting pot whatever because all the things that he's talking about are just like grocery stores delis that sort of thing there are obviously whole foods at trader joe's in new york they're not on every corner what is on every corner is like delis like that and as much as i think that this dude is funny i assure you you can get eggs and cheese in those delis if you look just beyond the sandwich counter people just got triggered and took this way too far and thought that he was being racist and so people found out where he worked and tweeted at his company which is outreach and said i don't think it's very flattering to have this type of person representing your company i would re-evaluate his employment if i were you and then outreach responded and said thank you for bringing this to our attention upon investigation we took swift internal action in accordance with our company policies and in alignment with our core values he is no longer an employee of outreach the internet got this dude fired the dude is just like an absolute chat walking around making stupid tick tocks they found out where he worked tweeted at the company and literally made him lose his job not cool not freaking cool and then outreach also tweeted something else and they said we always welcome feedback from the community as outreach continues to build our culture that finds strength in our diversity equity and occlusion give me a freaking break you can't even defend a single employee that makes stupid tick tocks for fun you are so scared of people on twitter behind stupid little anime profile pictures i don't know like grow a pair and don't bend a knee to the mob it's ridiculous okay so then people obviously started commenting on him being canceled i can't help but laugh at the fact that bro got fired for asking where the whole foods was at and uh somebody else responded and said very fragile people i thought new yorkers were tough somebody else said hall monitor ass culture yes it is uh karen to the max who better to bring this maniac to justice than me the whole monitor so then people started debating whether this was actually the video that got him fired now this was the video that was tweeted and was posted but the guy has a whole other tick tock account with other videos so somebody said i'm pretty sure he got fired for that tweet berating all the gay people yesterday and not this one okay was not a tweet it was a tick tock and he wasn't berating but here's the video just for context we're like this place is so crazy like so many gay people down here which i i don't hate it like i'm not gay but like you know i'm all for it do what you want but like like look at it you have to do that trend on those people where it's like he's a 10 but whatever and they had no idea what i was talking about but they're in the talk so it's hilarious [Applause] so this guy tweeted it and said my new favorite tick tock ever is this video which has 15 likes by some white guy from michigan who moved to the bronx and just found out about gay people so this poor jabroni showed up to new york in the middle of pride bless your heart he's operating gay people he seems like he's having a good ass time literally seeing a bunch of gay asses out on the street this is not mean or offensive by any means my god now there was another video that got people heated and essentially the internet started debating what actually got him fired so they pulled up this one this is also a tick tock where apparently he was being racist here we go to the mcdonald's gym for my second workout in new york got shoulders and arms today i'm in the bronx for a few weeks so i'm like the only white dude in this whole gym so i got this naacp shirt so uh these people vibe with me more so he's at his gym he realizes he's the only white guy he gets an naacp shirt says he wants to vibe with these people now people aren't really offended that he pointed out that he was only white guy they are offended that he said these people what do you mean you people and there were literally people on twitter equating that to calling them the n-word or you know the colored people whatever literally that was the thing that made them so angry the best way that i could describe this entire thing is it's just a dude from michigan getting slapped in the face by new york and a culture that is not homogeneous it's not bad to be from middle america it's not bad to move to new york and be like oh my god this city's kind of crazy and disgusting because news flash it is i'm coming over there yeah why did you come over here i got something for you shut up somebody commented and said supposedly the dude made a tick tock showing the company's offer letter to him that included income which would be more probable as their termination reason so again people are still arguing about what actually got him canceled somebody responded and said which would be illegal in new york you can't fire someone for talking about their salary you can't demand someone not discuss their pay nyc even passed a law requiring salary range on job adverts although business leaders got their implementation postponed we don't exactly know why outreach fired this guy i don't think we will ever know but clearly they got cold feet they freaked out because the internet posted one video of this guy and they were worried that they were going to be you know targeted that they were going to be canceled so they fired this man canceled him just to save their own asses so i really don't care what video it actually was it's just the damn principle of the thing all of these corporations are weak and it's bothersome and everybody on the internet just needs to chill the hell out if somebody posts a funny video on the internet most of the time it's probably not targeted at you they're not trying to oppress you they're not trying to be systemically whatever just let it go my only hope is that this does not you know absolutely ruin his life and that he can get another job people had an idea for a show for him nobody said everyone wants to find bodega bro a new job but i contend that he should get a tv show where he travels to different historically esteemed cities in the world and proceeds to on the rot of globalism in portrait mode our midwestern carl pilkington and call it a chad abroad somebody else on a completely different video said there's a great pitch for a travel show in here where bodega bro is just dropped off in random places around the world and has to film himself figuring out how to eat and get on with locals i'm actually writing a book around the world in 80 buffets if somebody needs to get him hired somebody needs to get him a contract i feel like babylon b is about to come out with an article that goes daily wire signs bodeca bro after he got cancelled because they do that basically every time anybody gets cancelled we'll wait and we'll see if that actually happens but the lesson here guys is that everybody just needs to calm down relax we're gonna have a great week it's gonna be fine hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "XauhZgzLm9E": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper so Chrissy Teigen is back in the news again now if you know anything about Chrissy Teigen you know that she has absolutely had her ups and downs she is quite controversial and very weird to be honest she got canceled uh canceled a couple of years ago for some awful things that she tweeted at a young woman she was bullying minors on Twitter even pushed some of them to self-harm she has also said some very pedophiley things on Twitter as well talking about how she was attracted to young people and like oh I just like love it when they like split their legs open like that is actually something that she said about young women and she plays it off as just being satirical and joking but in my mind the woman is a bit of a freak and she is an attention [\u00a0__\u00a0] and I stand by that but she's been pretty quiet for the last couple of years she got pregnant last year however she had a miscarriage and it was in the media they talked about it a lot it was very publicized and very constructed which always struck me as odd but I gave them the benefit of the doubt because losing a child at any age is a parent's worst nightmare my mother has gone through it I just I do not know how she has survived in my mind I thought maybe this is just their way of coping they're being very public maybe they're just trying to share their story wait raise awareness you know offer support I don't know I let it slide not my business but they posted things like this like very very intimate photos of her sobbing in a hospital bed not wearing a shirt which I'm sorry to bring this up but Chrissy Teigen loves showing off her boobs and so even in her worst hour she's like let me show off my boobs like I'm sorry that I said that but it must be stated like here's them holding their child who was miscarried and they said you know we are shocked and in deep pain you only hear about the kind of pain we've never felt before all seems very genuine in a way even though they did do like an entire photo shoot about the thing but you know like I said I digress however over a year later she has come out and said this she tagged this Hollywood report article and she said I told you all we had a miscarriage because I thought that is what it was but it was an abortion and we were heartbroken and grateful all at once it just took me over a year to realize it like I'm sorry what how do you just realize that you had an abortion like a spontaneous oh that that was what it was no did you decide to kill your baby or not the distinction is really quite simple so I'm not really buying this I also hate the line we were heartbroken and grateful all at once and once you get into the article she's talking about how it was a medically necessary life-saving abortion the baby was not viable she was going to die it just feels like she is redefining abortion as everybody has been doing aggressively for the last six months maybe said that she can just insert herself into this popular political narrative and get some brownie points so here are the quotes from The Hollywood Reporter article they pulled this from a conference where she was speaking and that's when she revealed all this information but she said two years ago when I was pregnant with Jack Jack is her child that she miscarried miscarried I had to make a lot of difficult and heartbreaking decisions it became very clear around halfway through that he would not survive and that I wouldn't either without any medical intervention she said she went on discussing her miscarriage before stopping herself let's just call it what was it was an abortion the star said an abortion to save my life for a baby that had absolutely no chance to be honest I never ever put that together until actually a few months ago Tegan said that she came to the realization after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade earlier this summer but what a coincidence what great timing for you to insert yourself into this narrative she expressed to Legend John Legend is her husband that she felt sympathy towards people who have an abortion and the circumstances that they had to go through the emotional decision they had to make when Legend made her realize that she was in fact one of those people they smell like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] there there is just so much going on here so we just kind of need to unpack this because there is a lot of confusion that is going on because they are welcoming us all into these very private intimate moments about their family and their relationship and their children but they're really not giving us details so it's just leaving everybody a lot more confused and concerned about what she's saying that she just realized that she had an abortion baby giving her the benefit of the doubt she actually did have a procedure to handle a serious medical problem that was going on with her and Jack her child and now she is just calling it an abortion because these Progressive pro-abortion Advocates have completely changed what the World Views as an abortion they've been saying that a miscarriage could be deemed an abortion that a stillborn child could be deemed an abortion the treatment for an ectopic pregnancy is actually an abortion when we know for a fact that it is not an abortion no Patrick mayonnaise is not an abortion horseradish is not an abortion either caught up in all of this rhetoric that she thought oh maybe that actually was an abortion or to not give her the benefit of the doubt maybe she actually did have an abortion maybe she chose a procedure that would kill her child while it was still in her uterus and she is just straight up lying about having a miscarriage or the final option maybe she actually did have a natural miscarriage but just wants to say that she had abortion so that she can insert herself into this conversation either way it feels very constructed and contrived and very odd and it's really rubbing everybody the wrong way somebody said Chrissy you and John Legend need to let some stuff stay private yeah they have been very open about very interesting things in their marriage somebody said same I told everybody that I had a miscarriage when I had an ectopic terminated turns out that was an abortion to save my life again no no it was not do we really need to discuss this again treating an ectopic pregnancy is not an abortion Planned Parenthood literally had it on their website until they realized that everybody was catching on so they scrubbed it to better fit into the narrative but this is what it used to read treating an ectopic pregnancy is not the same thing as getting an abortion abortion is a medical procedure that when done safely and a pregnancy that is in your uterus so if you have an ectopic pregnancy that you need to terminate because it will not survive and it will kill you that is a fact that is not an abortion if you have a miscarriage if you deliver early and they need to save your baby that is not a miscarriage and I didn't know that Planned Parenthood had removed this from their website until I was researching this segment and it absolutely disgusts me they are wanting to remove scientific fact for a political agenda they want to be able to continue lying to us saying that everything is an abortion any any any procedure that you could do involving a baby could be an abortion so that they can get more funding so that they can scare women it's disgusting and it breaks my heart that This Woman This commenter is thinking that by treating her ectopic pregnancy she had abortion no you did not you did the only thing that you were able to do and they're lying to you somebody else said should have kept that to yourselves because in my opinion that's worse to sit there and lie about having a miscarriage when in reality you aborted the baby shake my head yeah no matter what actually happened because like I said we don't know we have those three options it still is disgusting and you lied and now you're trying to backtrack so you can get attention that's just classic Chrissy Teigen stop Flying another person said no matter what it is technically called you still lost a baby and it's heartbreaking I wanted to put that comment in here because yes even though I generally really dislike Chrissy Teigen like I actually think that she is a vile human being she did go through something awful no matter what happened and how it occurred she did lose a child and that is something I always want to be so sympathetic and empathetic you know with women who have chosen to have an abortion even if they change their mind later on if they regret it whatever because still you went through something awful whether it was an abortion whether it was a miscarriage clearly she was going through some stuff did not stop her from lying about it for clout which is disgusting but I at least want to try to have some empathy if possible but now she's just lying about it and I'm disgusted and if she actually did choose to have an abortion and then flip it on its head and pretend to have a miscarriage and that that's just unexcusable again benefit of the doubt I would have a bit of empathy see but she really is just turning everybody off right now somebody said good Lord have you ever heard of keeping things to yourself it looks like you're just trying to jump on the abortion talk bandwagon yes especially because she literally said when Roe v Wade was overturned that is when she had this realization when everybody was suddenly telling their abortion stories Chrissy wanted to be involved shut up somebody else said I'm genuinely sorry for the Heartbreak Chrissy Teigen went through but who lies about this kind of thing the way she and her husband publish photos of their grief at the time for social media attention was indecent such events are deeply personal and should remain so yes and what she is doing now is also incredibly indecent Chrissy Teigen is a class A top-tier textbook narcissist and it's not even surprising the kind of person that would take those types of photos and publicize them for a PR stunt is the exact type of person that would then take that exact situation to turn it on its head change the narrative so that they can now fit into the next current thing and get New Media attention we see through the [\u00a0__\u00a0] it's not that hard another person said honestly if Chrissy Teigen couldn't get more insufferable now it's a life-saving abortion since abortion was banned girls stay off the tabloids we can't stand you another person retweeted the BBC article about this and said Chrissy Teigen says that she has come to realize that she hasn't been getting enough attention lately yeah she's finally coming back from her you know minutes of cancellation the timing is impeccable cool these people are Savvy they know how to work our outrage they know how to work media attention also coincidental timing in addition to Roe v Wade being overturned and this being the hot button issue John Legend who is her husband just released a new album like three weeks ago and I have heard literally nothing about it maybe I have not been on the right side of the internet but I had no idea but now he and Chrissy Teigen are trending constantly like they are a new political power couple and they want everybody to be sympathizing with them and also go by his album and go stream his music like the timing could not be more perfect for everything that they want and I hate to be so cynical about this entire story but these days I'm always a skeptic these types of people will do awful things for attention and Progressive brownie points there is no way the Chrissy teakin can come out on top in this story because option one she actually did have a miscarriage and that is awful but now she is exploiting her child's death and real pain that millions of women face every single year for a political stunt which is disgusting in option two she actually had an abortion but didn't want to talk about it didn't want to get pushed back so she lied and got sympathy for having a miscarriage and exploited her actions that way and exploited other people's pain like there is no positive outcome here I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt at the beginning because you know I would like to hope that she would not do this type of thing but when it comes down to it she is the perfect physical embodiment or manifestation of our society's utter lack of any type of moral compass like we have absolutely lost our way do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that Bell so you never miss an episode", "RaUOYMSLzTE": "[Music] is [Applause] i'm still confused about this her caption is did you know my gender is still feminine lol hashtag trans hashtag non-binary basically this person is upset because people can't figure out their pronouns they have a pinned comment up at the top this is where it gets spicy my gender is feminine i am not a woman don't call me one i like feminine terms but don't over validate me feels performative also non-binary is not a third gender non-binary covers many different genders one of which is mine also check bio for pronouns", "XozsTBSrAQE": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper so I think we all know Elon Musk has bought Twitter we talked about it last week we heard about some internet reactions this is kind of old news at this point but Elon is making huge changes every day a bunch of people have been fired the left is crying about that there were even people who were faking being fired in order to bamboozle the mainstream media and being like look at what he's doing to all these people and then it was somebody like named the ligma Johnson or whatever it's too good like the trolling is incredible but a lot of people are quitting a lot of people are being fired there's a lot of structural changes apparently Twitter employees who have not been fired are working overtime to implement all of these new Elon changes and today we're talking about arguably the biggest change but before we even do it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection so Elon has now announced that he will be introducing widespread verification everybody getting that little blue check mark for eight dollars a month and if I'm not mistaken that eight dollars a month will go into a big pool to then pay Twitter's top creators kind of a take on the monetization that Instagram and Tick Tock offers but anyway people are pissed the elites want their special blue check mark they want to be above the masses and the Socialists like AOC do not want to pay Elon any money she tweeted this which started a big feud between them which was hysterical to watch she said LMAO and a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that free speech is actually an eight dollar a month subscription plan which is funny that she's bitching about paying him any money because she literally owns a Tesla and if you have a Tesla you have to pay for upgrades you have to you know get the software you are constantly paying Elon money AOC go sell your Tesla and then we can talk the app he's still free he is not making you pay eight dollars a month in order to get free speech you just have to pay if you want that blue check mark and to have your identity verified your free speech is not getting squashed AOC you just won't feel as special because more people are going to have the blue check mark and I know that's a big hit to your ego but you'll get over it everybody does you'd better make it loud and clear or you'll never get it I honestly don't hate this idea because it is hard to get verified on Twitter especially if you are a more right-wing voice like I've tried multiple times and I usually get rejected which I don't really care about but it is like it just causes hurdles that you have to jump through and people at Twitter will actively keep these more conservative voices from getting verified and then they will privately ask them to pay up to fifteen thousand dollars to get verified it's like well we're not going to do it we're not just gonna hand it out to you but if you want to give over some cash then we'll do it Jeremy boring our CEO is tweeting about this the other day and he wasn't able to get verified even though he has a huge presence on Twitter and is the CEO of a huge Media Company he has a friend on the board and had to get somebody to intervene on his behalf because they were actively keeping him from getting that blue check mark so this is not like an equal play playing field at all so giving everybody the chance just to pay and say hey this is actually me doesn't seem like the worst idea but I digress the other big change is this Elon tweeted going forward any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying parity will be permanently suspended previously we issued a warning before suspension but now that we are rolling out widespread verification there will be no warning this will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up for Twitter blue any name change at all will cause a temporary loss of a verified check mark which is bad news for Jack was sobiak who I think changes his name literally every single day depending on what's trending but anyway really everything he is doing in my opinion is aimed at making Twitter users more transparent he's getting rid of bots he's verifying identities and doing this and the first person to get hit with this new Twitter simulation was none other than insufferable redhead Kathy Griffin because she changed her account to impersonate Elon and you can't see it here but she had changed her profile picture to match his changed her name to Elon Musk and she's verified so when she changed the profile picture and then had the verified Elon you might have thought that it was Elon and nothing of value was lost a lot of people a lot of people were freaking out and were tweeting things like this Kathy Griffin is a comedian that's autech and a fierce smart activist that is also a hot take I guess there is no such thing as free speech after all on this site but she didn't get suspended for just being silly and changing her name like a goofy he he ha ha joke she was suspended because she impersonated Elon and then used her impersonating account to quote urge Americans to vote for Democrats in the midterm elections to preserve abortion rights here's her quote I have decided that voting blue for their choice is the only right she wrote as musk that isn't just being a comedian and being funny that's lying and trying to use elon's massive influence against him to push an election in the direction that you wanted to go Elon replied to people tweeting about it and said this actually she was suspended for impersonating a comedian oh but if she really wants her account back she can have it for eight dollars absolutely roasted mostly peaceful memes posted this to Elon with the around and find out um and Kathy's in it it's just fantastic I love that video as you can see the more you break around the more you're gonna find out that has not stopped Kathy though she is undeterred she is coming back she logged on to her Dead Mother's Twitter account in order to be on the platform you what apologize in advance for all the comments you're gonna have to read about how ugly I am and they're probably gonna throw you in there too oh by the way this is kg I'm tweeting for my dead mother's account she would not mind hashtag free Kathy the fact that you are using your own free yourself hashtag is very cringe but I love this comment somebody replied to her on her Dead Mother's account and said I feel like I just watched a woman get tossed out of a party for peeing in the punch bowl and now she's knocking on the Windows asking the guest to ask the host to let her back in that comment chef's kiss perfectly describes it especially because Kathy like I said she's just so insufferable I think you guys remember her like holding up Trump's severed head she is just Gro I would not call her a smart Fierce activist like that person said she is just annoying she is unintelligent and she's just really rude and kind of dickish anyway Ethan Klein also wrapped around and found out and he got his account suspended as well and he changed his whole profile to look like musks as well and he started tweeting things like this he said even though Jeffrey Epstein committed horrible crimes I still do miss him on nights like this for his warmth and camaraderie rest in peace old friend he kept going and he said people are gonna say the n-word on Twitter that's a sacrifice I'm willing to accept for the cause of free speech the last one the lane Maxwell is an extremely decent woman who I had the pleasure meeting several years ago it is a shame how she has been demonized and ran over by the Press hashtag a free gallane now again dude that's not silly goofy haha funny funny parody parody let's make jokes you're pissed at Elon and you're hoping that idiots who are also pissed at him will latch onto these tweets that you believe are things that he would say man obviously you got banned but like that first comment that I read about Kathy a lot of people are upset because this does not seem like the free speech that Elon promised when he was buying Twitter and I understand that because I'm not in favor of you know suspending people willy-nilly that is what we have been dealing with for the past you know five years led to play Devil's Advocate and try to see where Elon is coming from this and all of the verification steps and everything else he is doing it seems like a push towards transparency you can say whatever you want just don't pretend to be somebody else in order to sway public opinion that's not honest and it infringes upon that person's right to speak publicly and of course I would hope that if a right-winger did this that they would get the same punishment so that things actually stay equal and this transparency is non-biased and non-partisan all in all though this is a very complex issue and things are changing at Twitter on a daily basis more on an hour to hour basis so let me know your thoughts in the comments below how you're feeling about all of it if you actually think that Elon is pushing Twitter in the right direction if you're excited about it because I'm excited to see where things are going but as always let's stay vigilant I don't fully trust Elon I really only trust myself and my mother and Rocky let's try not to have false Idols here but I think this could be positive thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this

"welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper guys we have a special guest today i am on the show with tyler fisher he is one of the stars of daily wire's new film tara on the prairie with gina carano tyler thank you so much for being here thanks for having me it's gonna be super fun so if you don't know about tyler you're about to adore him he is a comedian who is very active on social media his youtube is absolutely hysterical he does stand up but tara on the prairie is not a funny movie by any means it's not a funny movie no you had to uh you had to flex some serious muscle i mean you did bring some comedic relief i feel like yeah yeah i get shot a lot which i love there's a point when i get shot so much that people start laughing and so i did what does that say about people really maybe it is a comedy well you know it's a subtle age-old trope that it's like okay well if you can't if you're not laughing you're crying so yeah i was laughing because i was so horrified but you played it off and it was fantastic yeah it was fun it was fun to play a sick sick man in a man's world what bts stuff can you tell the daily wire fans do you have a funny moment from set um yeah yeah i i tried to keep it pretty light and i i continued to film my videos in character which was probably a lot of stuff about you know what was happening with the uh panty we'll call it and all that stuff and so i just thought well this is where i might be living in 10 years in the mountains of montana covered in dirt because i wasn't allowed to work because of my medical choice so uh so i just continue to kind of play that character i love it yeah were you always you know more anti-woke or did you have an awakening during during the panty oh i had a great awakening i love you yeah great awakening yeah i had uh i had coveted and i was watching cnn every night and just watching that death ticker and something i was like well this something's not right about this you know and uh yeah i started to people started to say you can't make fun of that you can't make fun of that and i'm thinking like would you tell an accountant you can't use the number seven on a calculator you know it's like you're not gonna be able to do your job and slowly i decided like i know i am going to make fun of that because they're telling people that comedy you know you can't make jokes about certain things that you have to be so sensitive whatever we have a lot of woke comedy specials on netflix yeah a lot of ones that i watch and make me want to die inside um so i thought that because tyler's here we could react to one of the wokest one of the most insufferable comedians on netflix i've not watched this news special so i have my producer part of it uh do you guys know who hannah gadsby is yeah sorry i can't do this you gotta go yeah like i can't do it this is gonna be this actually is triggering it is all right so let's get into it this is hannah gadsby um on being a woman in a man's world oh patriarch you are oppressing me right now i hope you know that i do do you know what to be the target of our jokes at the moment our obsession with reputation we're obsessed with we think reputation is more important than anything else including humanity and do you know who takes the mantle of this myopic adulation of reputation celebrities and comedians are not immune they're all cut from the same cloth donald trump excuse me who is she are they them excuse me she's so terrible i can't even build a wall around her and just lock her up lock her up you know pablo picasso harvey weinstein bill cosby woody allen roman polanski she's so angry these men are not exceptions they are the rule lesbian colbert that's who she is she's lesbian goldberg we don't give a sh we don't give a f about women or children we only care about a man's reputation what about his humanity these men control our stories it's like she almost got the point saying we should talk about men's humanity because you know you know the third way feminists they hate men you're all toxic everybody in this room is a is a cis white man so you all yeah are you i really don't know um at this point who knows but they don't they don't care about your feelings or anything like the odds are stacked against you in court like you people are me too whatever she almost got it like they don't care about their humanity almost but then it she misses the point entirely this should come this special should come with a weighted blanket i feel like i just need a hug while i'm watching this reputation hindsight is a gift stop wasting my time this feels like slam poetry that's not comedy look i am angry uh so i'm not very experienced in you know controlling anger it's not my place to be angry on a comedy stage i'm supposed to be doing self-deprecating humor people feel safer when men do the angry comedy they're the kings of the genre when i do it i'm just a miserable lesbian ruining all the fun on the banter when men do it heroes of free speech no the difference is the jokes just has to be jokes there and women can do that too if they're angry but there just has to be a joke they're adorable why are they angry what's up little fella are they angry about gosh you can't work it out they're like the canaries in the mind aren't they if they're having a tough time the rest of us are gone you remember that story i told about that young man who almost beat me up it was a very funny story it was very funny uh i made a lot of people laugh about his ignorance and the reason i could do that is because i'm very good at this job well god really man just give a mentally ill person a comedy special what will happen i actually am pretty good at controlling the tension and i know how to balance that to get the laugh at the right place but in order to balance the tension in the room that's true i couldn't tell that story as it actually happened because i couldn't tell the part of the story where that man realized his mistake and he came back and he said oh no i get it you're a lady he beat the out of me and nobody stopped him and i didn't didn't report i wanted to but my phone was charging i could just couldn't get to it i feel like this is something that if i was sitting in the audience i would feel very uncomfortable like i'm invading somebody's like private but i'm laughing at the parts that i probably shouldn't be laughing at right right i was like oh that was kind of funny i could laugh there he beat the out of me okay back down never mind god they should have a line of therapists at the door when people walk out oh yeah for help yeah she won't go to one obviously because they're her therapist the suicide hotline is actually right above her head for anybody to text live during and that is what happens when you soak one child in shame and give permission to another to hate and that was not homophobia pure and simple people that was gendered it would have been feminine that would not have happened i am injured because there's no lesbians like that they don't exist and this tension it's yours i am not helping you any more you need to learn what this feels like because this this tension is what not normals carry inside of them all of the time you say not normal yeah sign me up not normal i'm not that sounds like a dr seuss character and they're not normals with the stars in their bellies well it's a lot better than a lot of the things that they the labels i prefer not normal that's actually that could play in the midwest people go i'll get down on that not normal yeah you know i got a cousin who's not normal you know she's fine to the men in the room i speak to you now particularly the white men especially the straight white men stop pull your socks up how humiliating fashion advice from a lesbian that is your last joke wow that wasn't very funny no i feel like this is pity applause at this point yeah yeah i can't be real yeah you want oh you're standing come on you want to go for laughs during a comedy special i don't hate men i honestly do not i don't hate men just straight white man but but there's a problem you see i don't even believe that women are better than men i believe women are just as corruptible by power as men because you know what fellas you don't have a monopoly on the human condition you're arrogant but the story is as you have told it power belongs to you and if you can't handle criticism take a joke or deal with your own tension without violence you have to wonder if you are up to the task of being in charge what kind of man is she hanging out with [Music] but i am afraid a lot of ufc fighters full of men i am afraid and if you think that's unusual you're not speaking to the women in your life uh apparently i should be afraid because i'm in a room of all men you should be afraid but but whose room is it it's your brother it's my room i have power that's a beg to come on the show please this is this is so it's a it's a different uh i guess it's a different situation this is a pretty you know male dominated uh industry politics i guess i should be afraid of politics it is yeah okay i think so especially in the conservative world i guess that's what that's changing is it changing i think so i don't hate men but i wonder how a man would feel if they'd have lived my life well i'd have a netflix special that's for sure it was a man have a career i am not a victim i tell you this because my story has value this is a story value i tell you this because i want you to know i need you to know what i know to be rendered powerless does not destroy your humanity your resilience is your humanity i feel like this isn't a comedy special but it's like a brene brown-esque tedx talk like i went i need her to have the clicker and like the thing behind her yeah i was i was abused simple fix put the tedx thing on the back then you don't ruin comedy you don't throw off the whole thing then i would watch this and go like oh okay i'm like i'm hearing from a survivor yeah she's like escaped and she's like a fighter this one i'm like you're just needing attention and sad she's a full-blown narcissist yeah i mean well she's getting on stage in front of a lot of people under the guise of making them laugh yeah instead she's making them die inside also as a comedian when if i'm not getting a laugh every 30 seconds or something i'm dying inside i think that's most comedians if you can get up there and do that and not have to get laughs a sociopath well that's a great place to uh end this lovely special i'm so glad that i've learned that about her i'm obviously gonna go home and binge yeah and i'm gonna i gotta go get my comedy notebook and just simply remove all the jokes from it yeah and then i'll bring it to netflix do you have some you just need to lean into the trauma yes but not like making jokes about it just explicitly describe any horrific thing that you've been through just dump it on everybody yeah i think i've been beat up by a lesbian before so maybe that i don't see i don't think that would work i couldn't pitch that no because you can't because you you have to be you can't be oppressed by an oppressed person right that's a fun news that's a fun new thing what can go wrong there no not at all it'd be great so you know this is the comment section we obviously have to see what everybody else had to say somebody else uh said is she also angry about being identified as a comedian oh yeah this person agreed with us and said this is a therapy session with an audience only that she's the patient wow someone just said that on my podcast but my podcast is me kind of talking out my feelings i would never bring that to the stage that one joke where she said that she was good at her job hilarious so funny that was the best statement less than three minutes in and all i can think about is norm mcdonald is dead i think he'd actually died from watching this special just remember people if this woman can make it as a professional comedian you could be anything you want to be yeah that's true well at least you know i do is as ridiculous as you know this is that netflix has apparently terrible judgment on what they air i do appreciate the fact that they changed their culture memo a couple of weeks that's true and because they aired through a future base special they did not take down uh dave chappelle's and they said if you are uncomfortable working on this type of content netflix is not a place for you so maybe the tide is changing it is but can't you i just lost so much respect for them that they even went there now they're losing money and they're putting that out there they didn't want to put it no no they had to lose money yeah because i think that in quarter one they lost over 250 000 subscribers a bunch of people walked so i mean money i stopped watching netflix when is he you know aziz anzari the comedian he apologized during his special and i turned it off and i don't think i ever watched netflix again yeah i like ricky gervais i was disappointed in his special because he basically apologized for all of his jokes at the beginning he put up guard rails and he was like listen people say that i'm transphobic or whatever but i'm a comedian so i will be anything to make a joke land he was like i'll be transferring i agree with you i didn't like that yeah i i did feel that i i like a comedian just go up and do their act be brave and not not spell out what they're about to do we all know what comedy is we all know people are going to get offended you're rigged your vase just do just do it yeah you know i felt like if he was putting up the guard rails then i was like okay like yeah we're we okay we at least still have chappelle on netflix but i watched that and i was like you don't go to a restaurant chef comes out like look some of you might think this is gonna be too hot i'm gonna go back there and cook and you know i'm gonna chop the onions and it's gonna take a little while some of you but it's like it's like you're ruining the entire ruining it just go cook the meal and bring it to me and shut up everybody should take your advice they should just do it you're a very smart man um so smart frankly so smart you heard it here so smart so brave so tall so tall oh my god tyler thank you so much for coming on thanks for having me i'm ruining my day oh you're making me watch that oh i know but you know it was already ruined because you didn't have ac left to put me on suicide watch now you're gonna like just go insane from like looking at all this stuff eventually it's so confusing i know well then i'll have my own netflix special and i'll talk about my my mental illness thanks for having me yeah thank you for being here do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "sKiI6wgI_OY": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper happy Halloween everybody I am a stoplight I did not intend to be a stoplight this year for Halloween but I ordered a few dog toys on Amazon a couple of weeks ago I received one of them the other one I never received and instead this showed up on my doorstep a five-year-old's stoplight costume me being me I was like I wonder if I could fit into that because it looks really silly news flash I can't does that fit perfectly but you know what I can get it over my head it blinks it's fantastic it's the best gift Jeff Bezos could have ever given me for my birthday which was a couple weeks ago I'm going to assume that it was a Jeff Bezos birthday gift but anyway I digress this is what I am being for Halloween I almost did Kim Possible for the second time that is what I was on Saturday night when I went to a couple of parties however that wig is so uncomfortable it is so uncomfortable the bangs are awful it was just two in my face I knew that I was going to be wildly not in a happy place wearing that on the show so instead I'm being a stoplight and it is kind of on brand for some of the costumes that I've had in pretty previous years so anyway that is why I am dressed like a stoplight uh you guys can let me know what you guys ended up being for Halloween and what you're going to do in the comments if you were in my all access live last week those people chose Kim Possible as my costume which was very fun so if you have any updates let me know but anyway we are getting into the Paul Pelosi attack story today because it is basically what the entire internet has been talking about but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection so on Friday night Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul called 9-1-1 because he was allegedly being attacked and when police arrived they saw him being beaten with a hammer absolutely wild it is a awful and gruesome story but in true 2022 fashion it took 0.5 seconds for the media to immediately turn it into a political spectacle like I barely saw any empathy like hey is he okay I hope that everything is fine instead was like oh it must be a Maga Republican who broke in right before the midterms to kill Pelosi and instead they got Paul without even thinking hey I wonder how this could have happened let's look into the details because guys there are some weird parts to this story but first let's see what the media had to say this leg guy said the attack on Paul Pelosi was an assassination attempt on speaker Nancy Pelosi end of story no Republican projection or conspiracy can change this fact conspiracy theory a okay not everything is conspiracy theory Shannon watt said let's be clear the attempted assassination of speaker Pelosi and the assault on her husband in their home is not a story about crime it is a story about how Maga Republican extremism is inciting violence and harming our democracy those are some of their favorite words all crammed into one sentence Oh God she links this LA Times picture with Pelosi and her husband and like every time I look at Pelosi I think that she is like a wilting melting wax figure I really think that she could use some nimi skincare nimi skincare is my very favorite skincare brand they are 100 American made and they even Source some of their ingredients from local American Farms so you know where your products are coming from I have been using Nami for almost a year now and they have totally transformed my skin I do a combination of their hydrate and protect bundle and their daily glow up bundle I love that they have these routine bundles because it takes the hassle out of going to their website and trying to figure out like oh do I need this maybe I want this like everything is laid out for you they tell you how to use it it's perfect if you want to try them out go to nimiskincare.com and use promo code Cooper at checkout for 15 off your order again that is nimiskincare.com promo code Cooper at checkout and maybe I will send some of my next package to Pelosi anyway they did not stop there we have another tweet this person says Nancy Pelosi was the target of an assassination attempt her husband Paul was nearly murdered the impact of this has been underreported across all media Republicans are joking about it because after Jan 6 nothing about American democracy is sacred vote for your lives the impact of this has not been underreported look at the media everybody is on your side they are all thinking that this is an assassination attempt they are not taking two seconds to ask any questions about what this actually might be Hillary Clinton jumped in and said the Republican party and its mouthpiece now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories it is shocking but not surprising that violence is the result as Citizens we must hold them accountable for their words and their actions that follow but thankfully people online are holding these people accountable for their words and actions and calling them out and are not letting this kind of rhetoric stand and the first a clap back was actually Elon he replied to Hillary Clinton's tweet and said there is a tiny possibility that there might be more to the story than meets the eye and then he attaches an article that talks about Paul Pelosi possibly being drunk and having a dispute with a gay lover which could be the story so let's talk about that first of all look at what Politico published right after the attack officers arrived at the house knocked on the door and they were let Inside by an unknown person they discovered de Pape and Pelosi struggle link for a hammer after they instructed them to drop the weapon Scott said to Pape took the hammer and violently attacked Pelosi so they were just let in there was a random person that we're not talking about that was at the Pelosi residence waiting for the cops to get here to just let's Usher them into this exciting event that's going on it feels like the media assumes people just being let in somewhere makes it an insurrection it does not additionally in the 911 said that he did not know the person he was being attacked but then later in the call which is reported by the police he said that it is a friend it does not add up this meme has been going around on Twitter which I really love it says 2 A.M at the Pelosi house 2022 oil on canvas ah it's great that's fun in addition to that hashtag Pelosi gay lover is trending on Twitter truly a new landscape since Elon took over uh but let me give you some context for all the gay lover stuff because Michael schellenberger who is a fantastic environmentalist and political commentator has been going through this entire story on his sub stack and in my opinion he has the most thought out and rational take and he has the receipts as well this is his article that is now circulating her on Twitter it says Pelosi attack suspect was a psychotic homeless addict estranged from his pedophile lover and their children now first of all journalists have claimed that David de Papa that's his name is right wing because of some old rambling racist things that are on the internet from years ago but as Michael points out these posts really have no Rhyme or Reason he spouted things across all political aisles and just because he attacked Paul Pelosi does not make him Republican another important point he lives with a well-known nudist and assumed pedophile in San Francisco with whom he has three children and they're sort of estranged but he lives outside out of her house in a school bus and here are some photos from the house they have a weed Pride America flag outside it looks absolutely gross there's weird couches here's some stickers on the school bus definition of a liberal 911 was an inside job the official 911 story is a big lie some other stuff like that here's another picture I mean just like gross crap just disgusting and my favorite find which Ellenberger posted as well here is what these people's neighbor had to say about them a lot of people in the comments were thinking that this was Nancy Pelosi's neighbor and they were going this doesn't look like the same neighborhood this is an utterly no this is David de Papa and his pedophile estranged lover this is their neighbor our vehicle was out of commission I was walking past and gypsy's son was like a small little girl and he was on the Gypsy is the pedophile the little girl and Gypsy son were walking away from the bus and the guy remained on the bus and that's when I recognized his face that's the only time I ever saw his face was Within in like the last month or so or a couple weeks do you know along how he's how long he stayed during that a couple months ago no we try to just avoid them at all cost okay until they you know bother us okay but so the last time you saw was a couple weeks ago yeah and he was here for a few days yeah yeah strange about him or anything uh he is birds of a feather with a Akin to them so they are just you know nudist drug abusers and that's oh important point I have to pause this apparently David de Pope was part of a nudist wedding that happened outside of the San Francisco City Hall a few years ago and there's pictures of him there so this is not like a new thing for him the daughter of a girl he used to date also said that he was abusing drugs like way back in 2008 as well so this is not new this guy has been in the nudist drug infused San Francisco world for a while now so do with that information what you will I guess here we go and believe that they seem to be underage under 18. I'm not sure how old they are and Trisha again what's the what do you say their politics are um I'm not sure I would imagine that they're more left-leaning uh because of their support for uh um the gay community um and for uh I'm sorry for other people but uh it is uh now I'm not sure yourself what way they live because because they have the flag the LGBT flag yeah but any signs of anti-Semitism you know they are completely unhinged so I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised at all yeah uh they nothing that they believe in aligns with their actions so they'll say that they are you know pro-black lives and then they'll call the place on black people and uh so they don't stand by their actions don't stand by their words we think he's the father of some of them not sure at all but if he is uh their mom told me that there was a abusive nature in their father so if it is him then he has abused his own that also lines up with the like daughter of his ex-girlfriend that I mentioned and I don't know how close they are but she's popped up in a few of these news stories and she said that he abused she and her brothers when he was dating their mom while abusing drugs back again early 2000s so this guy just has a long tour history it's very confusing very unhinged I think the neighbor says the best unhinged erratic Behavior feels like it's the best way to sum it up this is not normal sane Behavior whatsoever and this all leads us to Michael's conclusion which he posted on Twitter and in his sub stack if you're interested in reading that whole article I highly recommend it it's great but he tweeted out and he said wrapped up in their obsession with Niagara Republicans journalists have missed the real story David de papa is not a microcosm of the political psychosis gripping America in general rather he is a microcosm of the drug-induced psychosis gripping the West Coast in particular absolutely I think that this is a very intelligent and Humane and spot-on way to look at this because I truly do not believe that this man David de Pape was politically motivated at all this behavior is too weird it is too erratic maybe he thinks that he's some communist leftist whatever that's fine I don't need to get into that though because I don't think that is what caused this attack or him being in the Pelosi residence the behavior is too weird it is too erratic I've seen that on the streets of LA on the Streets of San Francisco I've seen it in my family any of you guys watched my show you know that you know we have a history of you know drug abuse and some mental health issues I've seen this these types of people are not mentally there enough to make a conscious politically motivated decision that's kind of the whole point and I have no idea whether Paul Pelosi is you know dabbling in some fun gay kinky Behavior while Nancy is away or whether this was actually just a random attack from a druggie outside of his house in San Francisco my guess is that it is the former and it just turned South really quickly which is why he called 9-1-1 and if so then it seems like the Pelosi's have even more skeletons in the closet and they need to focus on that rather than corrupting and bankrupting our entire country and if this guy David apape may be gay lover maybe somebody who knows was actually in an episode of drug-induced psychosis then that should also be a wake-up call about the drug crisis in this country because that is truly the disease that is running rampant through this Society I mean it is it is everywhere and even though this is where my head is at right now I don't believe that this is the end of the story I mean there is so much evidence that has not been released yet the Pelosi's and their neighbors have hundreds of security cameras we have not even seen any of that evidence but in classic Legacy Media fashion everybody is jumping to these conclusions that are politically advantageous that they will never retract even if new evidence is brought to light but it is not going to stop the Democrats and they may entry media from saying that this is some anti-pelosi anti-democrat a threat to democracy and they're going to use that because guys the midterms are a week away they are truly grasping at straws and doing everything in their power to make us look terrible so the best thing that you could do is be vigilant think twice about stories before you come to a conclusion use common sense and critical thinking which I know you all have because these people are insane okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "0vY60A55Z4E": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper i'm kind of excited to talk about this story because in a way some people could kind of be bamboozled into having a woke take about this it has to do with women's issues and men being in women's spaces this is the girl's bathroom all right i need to tell you something wendy i'm transgender which is apparently something that we have to argue about and debate these days but the good thing is the man that we're talking about today is actually a man and he's not saying that he's a woman so at least we have that but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and as you probably know by now i just released the first capsule of my merch collection you can go to dailywire.com brett to check it out i hope you all like it so back to the real story a couple of years ago in scotland they decided to make all period products free now obviously they are not free somebody is still paying for them the taxpayers are still paying for them but they are government subsidized feminine products and since then they have created different councils to provide awareness about menstruation and all of this thing but they are now in the news because they have a new subset of their period council and the person heading it up is a man so this guy mr swim coach his new role is scotland's period dignity officer you serious a 30-something-year-old man is representing dignity when it comes to menstruating like we already have trans women competing in women's sports we have tampon companies trying to sponsor men and now literal government officials i rachel l levine and now we have men appointed to the government trying to teach women about their periods like i'm sorry do you bleed every month i don't think you do now i'm not saying that a man can't have an opinion on something because he's a man but isn't it just kind of weird and in the grand scope of women being erased just in general around the western world isn't this just a bit off color and that's where i think that you can kind of get woke here because a lot of people are going like a man can't speak on this he shouldn't like no if a man wants to he can but we have to admit that the whole thing is just a bit weird and now i didn't know that this story was really this big until somebody on my team texted me last night said like brad have you seen this this is kind of on brand for comment section i quickly googled it i pulled it up on twitter there were so many people talking about it i was like how has this not reached you know my corner of the internet yet but people like bbc and cosmopolitan are writing full articles about it here's the bbc one this is only 20 hours ago it says group defense hiring man as period dignity officer here he is uh the guy's name mr swim coach period dignity officer his name is jason grant so he was appointed about a week ago and the internet caught wind of this and so now all of these celebrities tennis stars you know scottish news anchors they're all speaking on this saying this is ridiculous why is a man speaking on this so the group is trying to kind of backtrack and say well he's not going to be teaching women about periods he's just there as like the head of marketing and make sure that everybody in the country knows that you can get free period products and apparently the job advertisement said that the suitable candidate needed a successful track record of engaging and empowering a large range of people from a diverse range of cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds in particular young people who menstruate so obviously the first part of that a man or a woman could be qualified for that job but in that second part in particular young people who menstruate what man reads that and goes oh that's me oh yeah i've talked to a lot of young menstruating people all right meg let's take a look at that vagina it's you have to admit it's just weird so again it's like this kind of thing i feel like both woke and based people are going to be pissed about this because on one hand i really don't care about your gender or your you know race when it comes how qualified you are for a job i don't really think it should be taken into consideration but when the job advertisement specifically is talking about women's issues feels like you might need to be a woman to be qualified for that a real biological woman the whole thing is just kind of confusing and i really enjoyed going down the twitter rabbit hole here one woman started a whole thread about it she's a scottish parent and she said there's something just deeply off about the first ever period dignity officer in scotland being a man it doesn't matter if he's the nicest man with the most empathy for women and girls the optics are just really poor oh and he's already telling us all genders have periods so number one it's a man running the period product council of scotland and then he's saying that it's not just women who menstruate here's his quote he said he was eager to make sure the people of any gender were aware of the availability of period products and he said i am absolutely buzzing about it it is definitely pioneering as scotland is the first ever to do that it is about making people aware of availability of period products for anyone of any gender whenever they need it your ancestors must be so proud oh he's buzzing he is just buzzing about giving period products to men obviously not real men because real men don't menstruate you can just call them women buddy it's not that hard the same twitter account posted the job advertisement that i referenced earlier and she said for the people saying that his job won't include speaking to young people i.e girls then perhaps read the job advertisement to help you understand that engagement with young girls is part of this role that was another thing that the whole council was trying to walk back on going oh no this is just like operations he's just running like the legal aspect of distributing the period products whatever no look at this and they said in particular you must be good at talking to young people who menstruate again young women it's not that complicated to distinguish and then we have a photo of mr jason grant sitting among some people with some period products telling them this is from a tweet why is there a man there why is that is that a woman man or is that a man man i don't know why this man is needing to learn about diva cups or whatever the hell he's doing but this person tweeted and said this man is explaining to a girl and her mother how best to approach periods and self-care around periods he's a period dignity officer now picture him as a priest rabbi iman weird isn't it yep 2022 oh no he's not gonna have any face time with young women literally he is on camera talking about period self-care did he read a teen vogue article about taking some my doll and getting a hot water bottle and some chocolate and he was like oh there we go my curriculum is set like dude no you don't know even if you were a fake woman you would not know like i said people in the scotland news media have also started to speak out about this i really love this video here we go it's the inevitable upshot arguably of you know a kind of denial of female biology i i guess you know if i don't know or perhaps people think it's not about the biology it's about the business of of delivering help for people who i don't know yeah this is this is um what i mean when you know it feeds into a narrative um that exists in scotland about that um biological denial of women and of course their questions also about whether or not the the council and the colleges use the exception that can be used in the equality act you know if there's if there's a role that is very obviously specifically for one sex or another then you can advertise it as such and it doesn't seem to have happened in this case and and that's how we've ended up with this uh young man as a period dignity officer and there were photographs of him uh that went out with the press releases of mansplaining in action i suppose that's how you would it see what she likes sitting at a table in a red polo shirt of course and um there are a number of period products uh in front of him and he's talking to a young girl and her mother about it and it just looks like the epitome of you know what people call mansplaining here here's a man telling women you know about periods and it is the optics of it i think sheila are just awful i mean this whole thing literally feels like an episode of nathan for you have you seen that nathan fielder where he goes and he gives basically terrible business advice to different small business owners and it's obviously god-awful and people go oh okay i'll take it it feels like he went in there and said you know what you gotta do you gotta get a man who is not a doctor not a gynecologist that's the only man that i want talking to me about my period um let's put him in a red polo shirt and just give him a spread of tampons optics gonna be great like how did you not know that this was a terrible idea because they're stupid like i hate the word mansplaining i think it's a bit ridiculous it's just it's not as big of a deal as the left likes to make it but this is actual mansplaining this man has never had a period he has no idea what's going on so even if he is trying to communicate this information from the goodness of his heart even if he is open-minded and well-educated you just don't know how it feels and i don't think you have the medical background to understand scientifically what is happening either it's just all wrong somebody said why would a man even apply for the job of period dignity officer i feel like this guy just wanted to get a girlfriend and he fed into the whole notion that you need to be woke and super beta in order to get a girl no you don't for most women we still want you to be masculine and not walking around talking about tampons another guy said period dignity officer sounds like a decent gig one week on and three weeks off he's gonna get all of scotland onto like a synced up cycle somebody else said out of interest would any woman here apply for the job of erectile dysfunction dignity officer oh god i would love to see that happen maybe that's what scotland needs to do next that would be a riot all right so now i hate to inform you it gets even more ridiculous that's impossible now i don't know where this hashtag started i was scrolling for literally an hour last night trying to trace it back to who did it first but there is a trending hashtag right now it is just ask jason jason meaning jason grant the period dignity officer everybody's tweeting things going just ask jason about periods and it apparently is part of the initiative as period dignity officer to ask him questions about menstruation i don't know if they are just trolling him or whether this was an actual initiative from his council because at this point i cannot tell reality from a joke when it comes to the story but the replies are just fantastic and some of them were a tad too graphic to bring on this show but this was the first one somebody said i know all about periods do you need a tampon just ask jason somebody said just ask jason since he'll be responsible for the education on menopause can you tell me the best cure for menopausal vaginal dryness oh this poor man somebody else said what i really want to just ask jason is how he is going to empathize with a girl who is sobbing because she has to deal with this every month for 50 odd years when boys never have to go through it at all ever how will he comfort her when he can't even say girl like that really hits the nail on the head now obviously i am not a woman that has gone around you know crying my whole life because i have to have a period it's the worst thing in the world no it's part of biologically being a woman every woman experiences and deals with it differently that's totally fine but the most important part is that this is singular to women obviously we can talk about it it's fine it's a normal thing it's biological but again this has to do with women what does this 30 year old man know what a young girl is going through when she gets her first period you don't you genuinely just don't i cannot wrap my head around who thought that this was a good idea and how are we supposed to expect him to empathize with young women if like this commenter said he cannot even acknowledge that it is a singular experience for women the whole thing is just bad whether or not you think that this is fine you can't ignore the fact that it's weird and that this man is somewhat thrilled about getting to spend his life talking about tampons and bleeding what man is excited about that i just want to know guys

but to be honest when is she not I feel like at least a couple times a week there are a few thousand tweets where people are either loving something that she is saying or threatening to kill her but there is a lot surrounding her in general right now because she just released a new novel outside of the Harry Potter Universe it is longer than infant adjust longer than the Bible so that should give you a bit of perspective and it is very Loosely about an online personality who goes against a mainstream narrative and then gets a ton of hate so a large portion of the book is actually hate tweets that are very similar to the ones that JK Rowling gets every single day she wrote it under a pseudonym originally then her name was leaked and now people are attacking her because they're going you're just trying to be a victim writing about the hate that you get that's deserved all of that stuff stop it get some help so anyway that's kind of the back story but now she's trending for something else but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and go check out my new merch capsule at dailywire.com Brett alrighty so this time we have two different JK Rowling hashtags that are trending the first one hashtag istand with JK Rowling pretty classic we see that a lot number two I can't stand JK Rowling how original which really I think you can kind of uh divide the people with common sense versus the absolute lunatics in our world right now based on this hashtag because JK Rowling is more of a liberal to be totally honest she supports abortion she is a lot more liberal when it comes to economics and she doesn't really get into politics she truly just cares about sex versus gender and protecting women so the current Firestorm on Twitter started when a very small account a trans activist to be very specific posted a doctored tweet from JK Rowling saying that she had posted this and then taken it down so here is what she originally said hashtag I can't stand JK Rowling because as much as people claim otherwise this is a real tweet and delete from her that was presumably intended to be tweeted on an ALT my copy of the screenshot was made by somebody I know IRL who had notifications turn on and screenshotted it herself so then she attaches this fake screenshot from JK Rowling where JK has presumably tweeted out a picture of a rainbow Harry Potter themed tattoo that says no one should live in a closet and then the fake JK Rowling tweet saying yes they should and then it's only a minute old and she already deleted it because apparently it was supposed to be on her alt because she doesn't want everybody to know that she's actually homophobic no you idiots like this is the perfect embodiment of the left caricature of JK Rowling but honestly not even just JK basically anybody that Strays from their narrative it's immediately like oh you are a villain you hate everyone because you're speaking truth and common sense it's like no she has a very significant problem with part of your ideology but she's not a bad person and she actually aligns herself with you guys a significant amount of the time so then JK responds to the allegations of this fake tweet because the fake tweet is now getting traction and as you can see she tries to tag the woman who tweeted the fake tweet but the woman has blocked her so she can attack her you do not see the hyperlink there that is why anyway she says this is a fake tweet that was created when I deleted an entirely different tweet with a typo in it then reposted the Creator claimed that this is what I deleted I am asking you to delete this defamatory claim and acknowledge the truth and she moved on and said interesting reaction and then you can see she's been blocked and then she goes on to say I'd just like to note that anyone can make a mistake on here I've done it myself whereas this person has used a fake tweet to prop up her theory that I have an alternative account on which I am vehemently evil and then she posts a screenshot from this person tweeting out and saying it really shows just how virantly evil her behavior is when she thinks she's using an ALT few people are just idiotic then she says just so you know I maintain an alternative account only to post pictures of my knitting currently working on a series of 19 80s pop stars and four ply wool very reasonable prices uh this is a joke please do not buy knitted 1980s pop stars because you think I made them so she's at least finding some humor in this situation which I always respect about JK Rowling because even when she is getting death threats and people are saying like I want to kick you in the knees I want to find you and I'm gonna kill you all of this stuff because literally those are the tweets she gets she still finds a way to be positive to make jokes and to support the people who are reaching out to help her and support her but back to the main part of the story to top off this whole Ridiculousness she literally tweeted the exact opposite of that fake tweet in 2014. here it is this was on uh December 16th 2014 and she tweeted this graphic if Harry Potter taught us anything it is that no one should live in a closet with rainbows now whether you agree with that or not whether you support it whether you like JK Rowling whether you don't she is not homophobic she has literally tweeted the exact opposite of the thing that you are accusing her of tweeting and then here's the kicker it has been proven that this tweet is false because the person tweeted the same doctor tweet last year here's the person who found it they said she tweeted the same tweet in 2021 but no traction so she retweeted it again this year this time got 7 000 likes trans activists just love to hate here is the tweet from last year she goes by the way that fake tweets attributed to me bit is probably referring to this tweet that she claims is a fake but this particular screenshot was taken by somebody I know IRL who had notifications turned on for Rolling I think she accidentally tweeted it on Main like are you are you that insane yes of course the definition of insanity is doing something multiple times and expecting like a different outcome are you insane whoa yeah it took you long enough like you're gonna try this bit again just to get some traction and if you are gonna do that like lady delete the evidence like you are not only insane but you are also a dumb internet user and even though all of this has now been proven to be false even though it is clearly defamatory it has not stopped people from lashing out and using the like I can't stand shake your rolling hashtag like this person said it is no longer ethical to consume or monetarily support any of JK Rowling's works I don't care about death of the author I don't care if you're purchasing used books I don't care if your kid wants a Harry Potter birthday party there is no more neutral territory here you are one pathetic loser these people live a very very sad life like you just said you don't want a kid to enjoy Harry Potter because you disagree with the politics of the author who was not even political at that time who was not even on Twitter in the 90s writing Harry Potter no that is just sad another person said JK Rowling is a privileged Mega rich white woman who has used her power to worsen hate at one of the world's most stigmatized minorities she is no victim hashtag I can't stand JK Rowling it really cracks me up the people these days that claim that they are oppressed like just yesterday we talked about lizzo accepting her VMA award and going like we need to change the laws and vote for people who are not going to oppress us anymore lady you are not oppressed and you you Twitter user you are not oppressed either because when every single societal and corporate institution is on your side bending a knee to your ridiculous delusions that is not oppression you are now a privileged class another person said if I see I say with JK Rowling trending one more [\u00a0__\u00a0] time I'm gonna punch someone again so pleasant they're all very happy people uh but something semi-positive did come out of this obviously there were a lot of people tweeting out saying I stand with JK Rowling and there were a lot of very similar tweets of like I can't believe that these fake tweets are resurfacing again she never said this we need to support her uh but amidst all of this chaos Marie Claire did a hit piece on JK and called her problematic and Incredibly and increasingly Troublesome and uh so here is the article it says how JK Rowling went from esteemed to problematic in just a few years but what I love is that people have taken that slander and they have turned it into something empowering this person tweeted out and said just change my bio to include problematic and increasingly Troublesome problematic and Troublesome women everywhere you are awesome and then hashtag I stand with JK Rowling it kind of reminds me of that quote where it's you know well-behaved women never make history or like the Jane Austen phrase opposite headstrong girl which I think Mr Collins says in Pride and Prejudice um and both of those phrases were turned into kind of rallying cries and obviously those are more feminist in nature I do believe in original feminism which is where men and women are on equal playing fields and where women do have opportunities which we do have now but I do love those phrases and I love that they can be turned into something powerful and that is clearly being being done with this problematic and increasingly Troublesome and so you know what I'll take that one on as well I am also problematic and increasingly Troublesome for many people on the internet I am sure and that's totally fine I don't really care and if you are as well you should not care either do you

often has me do things that I am not aware of before I sit down in this chair or things that I've never done before which is kind of fun it keeps my life exciting whether it's you know watching something like Star Wars Lord of the Rings or eating terrible foods but today we're doing something that might shock you all and I'm gonna watch SpongeBob I remember growing up when I told people that I didn't watch TV that my parents did not have television at least for my generation the response was you never you but what about SpongeBob you've never seen SpongeBob no I have not in like hotels maybe I would catch like five minutes of an episode I don't understand the premise of it they're underwater but they all look like cheese I don't understand or like weird little animals see I don't know if they're sea creatures or it's some like mythical thing I genuinely don't understand the premise I don't know why they're there I don't know why he lives in the pineapple I don't understand but my editor Max my dear editor Max he is the one that always puts SpongeBob memes into the show and Anime if you are watching an episode and you see that those are very prevalent it's usually Max Max is pulled some special actual SpongeBob episodes for me to watch and we're also going to watch like the OG SpongeBob Christmas special because I have friends that swear that this is like what gets them in the holiday spirit that feels a bit much to me like you could watch A Christmas Story or Love Actually or the Charlie Brown Christmas like SpongeBob I don't understand the hold that it has on my generation but you know what today I'm Gonna Learn we're starting off with an episode called Band Geeks and if you guys have beef with what episodes I watched you have to take it up in the comments section and Max can read them and he can fight with you about them finally a good reason to punch a teenager in the face not me because I don't understand what's been put in front of me but I'm just here to observe I also have snacks I didn't have a big bowl of popcorn like I usually have a big bowl of popcorn when I wash things at sheller's house but I had to make do with our like craft Services here at the studio they are underwire that's Squidward oh we're with a pet hospital down the street and I understand you have a dying animal on the premises huh it just so happens that I don't sell fat food is the service industry reference to like the Krusty Krab correct you've never watched episodes of SpongeBob either before thank God I'm not the only weird one here I think that it's there's like the Krabby Patty or whatever and they all work there I don't understand it I feel like I need like background but okay but I guess Squidward works there but I did know that his name was Squidward because there are memes about him I don't know why this other man is here who looks just like him maybe they're like a species of the same undersea creature it looks like an octopi squid oh Squidward squid wow I'm an idiot okay is mayonnaise an instrument no Patrick mayonnaise is not an instrument is this the part where we start kicking no SpongeBob That's A Chorus Line kicking I want to do some kicking [Music] [Music] that's me watching this whoever's the owner of the white sedan you left your lights on oh [Music] flying swirlers let's move come on move [Applause] that's nice [Music] [Music] that's funny Bring It On old man bring it on no people let's be smart and bring It Off the whole thing is about SpongeBob but it's been six minutes and he finally just said a word I feel like I'm missing SpongeBob content I also didn't know he talks like that little people [Music] anyway sorry that was my impression of SpongeBob well Squiddy this is exactly how I pictured your band with luck that's Vance's eager face that's the spirit Squidward okay football fans put your hands together oh my God what is going on I don't understand what universe is this why are there real people that look like they're from like the 70s bouncing up and down that's probably like that was there not the 70s it was like 80s or 90s maybe I'm so confused how do they just arrive is he cheese is he or is he like a sea sponge what's Wally [Music] it's so tiny [Applause] you know not bad but in like the last 45 seconds that is when I started to like it I didn't hate it I'm just confused it's not my normal type of humor but that also could be because I don't understand context but just in my normal day-to-day life I'm kind of unfazed by not getting things because my friends will reference things Bobby and show my old team is made up of people who know a lot more about these types of things than I do and they say things they reference things and I have no idea I'll be in the break room trying to like be cool and socialize with people and people are like throwing references and like phrases catchphrases back and forth and I'm like you guys sound like you're speaking a different language sorry I don't speak Italian so the other one we're gonna watch here is this it's called Christmas who and it is the SpongeBob Christmas special from 2000. I think that's when it came out I have a couple friends who love this and they watch it to get into the Christmas spirit I would not think that SpongeBob will get you into the Christmas spirit but you know what that's okay I didn't know that there were multiple Christmas specials but this is like the OG one and I got confirmation so here we go for Christmas is there a pirate why is there a pirate yelling at me I don't understand the animation versus real life like what is there like Bully and Max in bikini bottom or something are they like hunting for gold Bikini Bottom might not have bully

this pirate and back to Under the Sea he's still singing at me I have before I get into this what like crackhead was sitting around and was like you know what like high out of their mind or drunk whatever you want to say and is like let's create this world under the water where the lead character is a sponge but there are real people in it above the sea and there's a pirate yelling at you when he lives in a pineapple I need to like see a brain scan okay and now America's favorite pilot and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Patchy the pilot what is going on hi I'm Patchy the Pirate president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club hey that's better I hate all my friends who comes up with this stuff and who so how is it successful I'm looking at the pirate who's the fan the head of the SpongeBob fan club he has pictures of Patrick and SpongeBob on his mantle I'm only one minute in I need to like slow down bro I'm gonna stop talking Christmas who y'all never what is she doing down and under the ocean why is she Southern she actually looks like me talking about Christmas to be quite honest oh God not that I understand her love of Christmas stuff right Mr Krabs what did you wish for a pony really with saddlebags full of money great Squidward you finished what's your wish my wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this thunderhead's mouth geez Squidward maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said [Music] everyday [Music] it's kind of an annoying little [\u00a0__\u00a0] I can see why my mom didn't want me to watch it that's cute watch this a present I made it for you so you wouldn't feel left out with Santa key oh I feel like a I feel like a that's funny I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom SpongeBob you did I did oh [Music] Merry Christmas I don't understand the intersection of the animation the real if Santa was there why couldn't he have just brought the presents himself ah the weird pirate is definitely the strangest part of this whole thing once it got into like the Squidward and that stuff it was like cute and wholesome and it felt like it had like a nice message it was a good character Arc I got into it I was enjoying I understand the appeal like it was silly it's goofy it doesn't really make sense kind of all the right formulas for a successful children show I guess I like that I'm saying all of that and I literally never watched any like children show so I have no idea but you know what I love the memes and I love Max for putting the SpongeBob memes in the episodes because when I see them they make me laugh even though I have absolutely no context but if there was another show from your childhood that you think that I should watch drop it in the comments because 99 chance I have not seen it and if you want to debate Max about which episode I watched you can also put that in the comments until next time y'all

"welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper one thing that i love about this year honestly over the past couple of years is how many disgruntled liberals have come out of the woodwork i mean we saw elon musk announced last week that he's gonna start voting republican joe rogan is basically siding with us on so many issues russell brand tulsi gabbard even though she's technically still a democrat but a lot of these people who have common sense are realizing how left liberals have moved how left and progressive democrats have gotten and so they feel like they are without a party and as a result they're moving over to the right side of the political aisle because we actually use our brains to think one of my favorites has been bill maher but before we get into it make sure that you

progressively red pilled coveted was a big changing point for him he talks a lot about wokeness and racism and identity politics and he has always stayed true to his principles while the rest of his party has just gotten absolutely crazy his opening monologue on friday i believe really struck a nerve with people because he decided to attack the trans issue and obviously people were not happy if something about the human race is changing at a previously unprecedented rate we have to at least discuss it broken down over time the lgbt population of america seems to be roughly doubling every generation according to a recent gallup poll less than one percent of americans born before 1946 that's joe biden's generation identify that way 2.6 percent of boomers do 4.2 of gen x 10.5 of millennials and 20.8 percent of gen z which means if we follow this trajectory we will all be gay in 2054. i love this graphic it's so good and then who's going to buy this chair [Music] [Laughter] i'm just saying that when things change this much this fast people are allowed to ask what's up with that all the babies are in the wrong bodies was there a mix-up at the plant like with cap'n crunches oops all berries it wasn't that long ago when adults asked a kid what do you want to be when you grow up they meant what profession in the wake of america about to lose abortion rights the aclu recently tweeted a list of those who would be disproportionately harmed by this you would think women might top that list no wasn't even on the list second on the list was lgbt really abortion rights affects gay and trans people more than you know breeders i'm happy for lgbt folks that we now live in an age where they can live their authentic lives openly and we should always be mindful of respecting and protecting but someone needs to say it not everything's about you you know this is the first time in a long time that i've actually watched something from late night television and chuckled and had a genuine laugh because comedy was ruined by sensitivity and snowflakes and political correctness and this is funny because he's being honest he's poking fun at like a genuine problem and a concern in our country and it's funny i feel like i'm starved for comedy that is honest because we're not allowed to talk about any of these issues unless you're one of those like protected people in that identity politics world thank god for bill maher for actually putting his neck on the line and making these jokes and bringing up these topics because nobody else is going to long gone are the days that snl would ever dare say anything that was remotely controversial or spicy at all now it's all just confirming mainstream democrat narratives it's literally all it is so my two cents it's okay to ask questions about something that's very new and involves children the answer can't always be that anyone from a marginalized community is automatically right trump card might drop end of discussion because we're literally experimenting on children maybe that's why sweden and finland have stopped giving puberty blockers to kids because we just don't know much about the long-term effects although common sense should tell you that when you reverse the course of raging hormones there's going to be problems we do know it hinders the development of bone density which is kind of important if you like having a skeleton [Laughter] this isn't just a lifestyle decision it's medical weighing trade-offs is not bigotry this is probably the most important part of this monologue because he is talking about the long-term effects of children going through you know hormone therapy and puberty blockers and these surgeries which people don't like to discuss and you're going to see in the replies people are criticizing him for talking about the rates that people are becoming lgbtq they're making fun of the caption that he used when he tweeted out this video but nobody wants to respond or touch any of this and this is the stuff that we should be scared about instead they're just going you're just a bigot conveniently they don't want to discuss the fact that they are mutilating children because obviously that's uncomfortable and they don't want to be put in that situation a book questioning the sudden uptick in transitioning children was released a trans lawyer with the aclu named chase strangio tweeted stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100 a hill i will die on how very civil liberties of him chase by the way has just been named one of the grand marshals of this year's new york city pride march along with three other trans people and a lesbian huh what's missing here oh right a gay man also this chase person responded and said why does bill maher assume that i'm not a gay man daddy chill what the hell is even that dude look at your own bio maybe you could maybe that would help google yourself that's often very illuminating you google this person and all the pronouns are she it says like chase did this and she's a lawyer with whatever then i go to chase's twitter and the pronouns are they they're non-binary so bill maher is making a valid point that like are you actually a gay man because nobody can really seem to tell that's where we are now gay men aren't hip enough for the gay pride parade compared to trans gay is practically cis and cis is practically mormon and this is a phenomenon we need to take into account when we look at this issue yes part of the rise in lgbt numbers is from people feeling free enough to tell it to a pollster and that's all to the good but some of it is it's trendy penis equals man okay boomer remember the prime directive of every teen is anything to shock and challenge the squares who brought you up it's why nobody gets a nose ring at 56. and if you haven't noticed that with kids doing something for the likes is more important than their own genitals you haven't been paying attention yes it is social contagion it is the same thing as teenagers and young adults on social media thinking that it's trendy and cool to be depressed and anxious because it's like emo and hip no these are real medical issues none of this is trendy and if you don't think that it is i don't know how else to explain it to you but he's doing a great job if you attend a small dinner party of typically very liberal upper income angelinos it is not uncommon to hear parents who each have a trans kid having a conversation about that what are the odds of that happening in youngstown ohio if this spike in trans children is all natural why is it regional either ohio is shaming them or california is creating them if we can't admit that in certain enclaves there is some level of trendiness to the idea of being anything other than straight then this is not a serious science-based discussion it's a blow being struck in the culture wars using children as cannon fodder i don't understand parents who won't let their nine-year-old walk to the corner without a helmet an epipen and a gps tracker this whole thing is so good he's hitting everything he's talking about helicopter parents too he's on fire this is like his major red pill moment there is a reason why this has 4.4 million views like the man's spitting facts forbid their lips touch dairy but [Applause] but hormone blockers and genital surgery fine talk about a nut allergy the woman does not like it and if you're a man who wants to experience life without a pair of balls you do not have to get surgery you can get married i can't always joke and never forget children are impressionable and very very stupid maybe the boy who thinks he's a girl is just gay or whatever frazier was [Applause] maybe the girl who hates girly stuff just needs to learn that being female doesn't mean you have to act like a kardashian i'm sure the vast majority of parents do not take this lightly and that is very hard to know when something is real or just a phase and i understand being trans is different it's innate but kids do also have phases they're kids it's all phases the dinosaur phase the hello kitty phase one day they want to be an astronaut the next day you can't get them to leave their room gender fluid kids are fluid about everything if kids knew what they wanted to be at age eight the world would be filled with cowboys and princesses i wanted to be a pirate thank god nobody took me seriously and scheduled me for eye removal and peg leg surgery that was one of the greatest monologues i've ever seen it's probably the greatest late night monologue i've seen in years that tops anything that snl has done in the past six years to be honest the man is incredible that's actual comedy but are you surprised that the entire internet is pissed at him no because he was being factual because he was being honest and he was asking the questions that i feel like the majority of the american population somewhere in our gut is going oh this feels wrong but you know what the people on social media with their infographics the raging angry aclu people are telling me that i'm a bigot so i guess i've just gotta roll over no these are serious questions we are talking about the long-term effects on children because people are cutting them up they are blocking their development like this is real and it's awful obviously people were losing their minds somebody said if hbo parent company and warner brothers discovery doesn't want to be branded as a hate organization then they should sever all ties with mar mars toxicity will hurt the other brands of warner brothers discovery okay get over it you're offended that a company is allowing somebody free speech to ask questions take the training wheels off you live in the real world we live in a country with free speech get over it when he posted the video he quoted himself and he said if this spike in trans children is all biological why is it regional either ohio is shaming them or california is creating them this person like many others said trans children in ohio are constantly under attack from our state and local government trans people are everywhere governments are regional yes that is a fact there are different policies surrounding transgender children and trans surgeries in different states there's also different cultures in different states and bill maher acknowledged that but he is asking an important question why are all the trans kids in california or new york and you know what maybe all those commenters maybe they have a point maybe it is cultural but i don't think it's cultural in the way that they're saying it's cultural in that in la it is an accepted trend to be trans to be lgbtq to be you know non-binary in ohio no they're doing other things and that's not going to fly they aren't raised in west hollywood where all the crosswalks are painted to look like pride flags so yes different cultures but it does not mean that the one in ohio is necessarily bad or evil so many people started posting a graph about left-handed people maybe this is some normal argument that i was not aware of but just like go into bill maher's replies on this post and you will see like 50 of them somebody said let's consult the past shall we where did all the left-handed people come from parentheses they were always there and they're posting this graph of the history of left-handedness that apparently at this uptick was when we started having like left-handed products and it became you know more acceptable to be left-handed i really don't see how these arguments go hand-in-hand they don't even work together these are completely different topics we're not talking about harming children we're talking about left-handedness so it's absolutely logical somebody responded to this person and said i don't see the point with a left-handed argument were they giving left-handed kids experimental drugs that could affect their biological development cut off kids right hands because they came out as left-handed because that's what's going on now with the trans movement like harsh but true there's a meme and it said don't make me tap the sign and then it's the left-handed one even the people posting the graph are making fun of the fact that they have to post the graph so it's just a meme at this point literally another person said bill maher suggests the kids are coming out as trans because it's trendy and being gay is not hip enough anymore momar is experiencing a bit of sanity will soon be hated as much as elon musk yes the moment that he posted that monologue he was targeted like i would not be surprised if he gets me tooed this week you guys saw what happened with elon he announced that he was republican and then within a day the attack started coming at him elon joe rogan bill maher all of these disgruntled liberals they're very timpool in their ideology the way that they seek the truth and are open about their transition from being liberal to now being in more conservative circles but again and many people point out these people aren't conservative bill maher is pro-choice he talked about it in this monologue they're just pro-common sense and they're pro leaving children the heck alone which shouldn't be a controversial opinion but we're living in a society of groomers and freaks so that's what we're dealing with do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "PK8rO1KfpEQ": "[Music] [Music] my God I can't even listen to this anymore the caption is me trying to give the radio a chance literally the only times I turn on the radio are when my phone has randomly died and I'm charging it in my car but I can't drive in silence so I have to turn on the radio and it's possibly the worst Driving Experience I ever have somebody said the hardest classical rock on the east coast and then Imagine Dragons starts playing man like I don't even get that quality music mine is usually like off-brand screamo heavy metal Rock stuff but if you like that sort of thing maybe try the radio", "_5IU7lFUa8U": "welcome back to the comment section everybody I'm Brett Cooper today we're going to talk about one of my former favorite late night hosts and I know this is going to be cringe you're going to be like Brett I cannot believe you used to like this guy but I have my reasons and today we're talking about James Corden who is the host of The Late Late Show uh with James Corden uh he is leaving his position in 2023 which is kind of good for all of us because in recent years James Corden is anything but a comedian he attempts to be a political pundit and James corden's downfall can sort of be pinpointed in two separate events number one when Trump became president and number two when James Gordon decided to be in that terrible horrific live-action version of the musical Cats but I did used to enjoy James Corden I thought he was like a little Jolly British roly-poly I thought he was funny he would do singing and dancing as a theater kid I liked him but now I am regretting all of that but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett check out my merch collection the Polaroid teas have already been shipping keep tagging me in those photos I am so excited that you guys like them and if you have not bought any yet what are you waiting for go to dailywire.com love it the new news with James Corden is that he was banned from a very well-known New York City restaurant so the owner of the restaurant Keith McNally is incredibly renowned in New York City he is often called the restaurateur who invented downtown and his most well-known restaurant is called Balthazar and it's frequented by you know New York high society and celebrities and James Corden is no different so Keith posted this on Instagram yesterday he said James Corden is a hugely gifted comedian I would disagree there but nevertheless we continue but a tiny creation of a man and the most abusive customer to my Balthazar servers since the restaurant opened 25 years ago I don't often 86 a customer but today i-86 Gordon it did not make me laugh here are two examples of the funny man's treatment of my staff managers report number one in June James Gordon was here at table number 61. although this is diabolical it happens very occasionally in all restaurants and he found a hair in some of his food and after eating his main course Gordon showed the hair to the baltazar manager G who was very apologetic and Gordon was extremely nasty to G and said get us another round of drinks this second and also take care of all of our drinks so far this way I won't write any nasty reviews in Yelp or anything like that now this is the second manager's report James Corden was a Balthazar with his wife on October 9th for brunch he asked for a table outside Branch Mater D Ali Walters took the party to table 301 Mr corden's wife ordered an egg yolk omelette with gruyere cheese and a salad a few minutes after they received the food James called the server MK and told her that there was a little bit of egg white mixed in with the egg yolk MK informed the floor manager G and the kitchen remade the dish but unfortunately sent it out with home fries instead of the salad that's when James Corden began yelling like crazy to the server you can't do your job you can't do your job maybe I should go to the kitchen and cook The Omelette myself MK was very apologizing and brought G over to the table he returned the dish and after that everything was fine he gave them promo champagne glasses to smooth things out and G said The Cordon was very pleasant to him but nasty to the server MK was very shaken but professional that she is she continued to finish her shift so that was the post and that was the executive 86ing of James Corden from that restaurant and obviously you know things go wrong in restaurants I was a server for a while I have been a customer where things happen and I understand the behind the scenes communication gets lost and as a customer and as a respectful and nice human being there is a way that you can go about saying hey maybe this isn't right hey could I you know I ordered this could I have it changed without being a dick and it seems like James Corden really doesn't have that ability now the restaurant owner Keith gave an exclusive interview to page six and he said that he was reluctant to publicly blast Corden but he did so out of loyalty to restaurant servers everywhere and he said their jobs are hard enough already they shouldn't have to take this kind of abuse from anyone especially the Rich and Famous I absolutely agree with that and at that moment I was pretty content this guy seems based he's willing to back up his servers he did this to support them and wouldn't you expect then that he would stand by these statements I would but apparently he did not because James Corden then called him immediately after seeing this post and apparently he apologized and they've worked things out and he was unbanned from the restaurant in less than 24 hours so this man that was apparently so nasty so awful that he had to be publicly blasted in 86th just called and apologized and literally was overturned immediately it kind of smells fishy to me to be absolutely honest uh here is the second post where he is rescinding the Banning and he said James Gordon just called me and apologized profusely having myself more than most people I strongly believe in second chances so if James Corden lets me host his Late Late Show for nine months I'll immediately rescind his band from Balthazar no of course not but anyone magnanimous enough to apologize to a deadbeat lay about like me and my staff doesn't deserve to be banned from anywhere especially Balthazar so come back to the five and dime Jimmy Corden Jimmy Corden All is Forgiven XX it on it's just it's just a little weird like he was so hostile he was so angry he was so willing to defend his staff and suddenly he's like oh Second Chances he's totally fine everything's great James cord what a guy fantastic nope it's just a little off if you ask me and the rest of the internet it seems like has a similar attitude about the entire situation somebody commented and said how much money did his PR team have to throw at that restaurant to revoke the ban seems quite likely to me another person said the weird part is no one was coming for them no one was siding with Gordon he is that hated in the general sense so I don't know what caused them to backtrack the money that's what caused them somebody else said 24 hours of publicity for the restaurant I mean that could also be incredibly plausible because a restaurant that is really not that well known outside of the New York City Scene is now being talked about in the mainstream media on every Outlet throughout social media so either way it's kind of a win for this guy in his restaurant James Corden is flailing around and everybody thinks he's a dick which he probably is but the restaurant is doing great so either way it just is a bit weird but then people started doubling down and sharing their own stories and you know we're going to get into this but guys if you have any crazy stories about a celebrity about

the celebrities find out that you did it but anyway let's get into the juicy details about James Corden so this one is on Reddit this guy said hey James you won't remember me but me and my friends sat at a table next to you and Harry Styles and some others in Manchurian Legends in London's Chinatown about six years ago we didn't bother you but you were a massively entitled who yelled and treated the weight staff like [\u00a0__\u00a0] and with one of my party politely suggested that you calm down you got really aggressive and threatening in a chubby way like a boozy Panda so my question is why did Harry seem so cool while you were such a massive throbbing villain which guys I just realized is British slang for an annoying or contemptible man so I'm gonna be using bellend a lot because there are a lot of those men out in the world now this post was not just trying to hop on the bandwagon and add fuel to the fire this Reddit post is from three years ago so this was already out there now this same Twitter user also posted this this is from a pilot he says a half an hour into a New York to London flight passengers in business class noticed a woman with a crying baby being brought through the curtains by a flight attendant they looked on in mild horror as they saw the attendant direct her to an empty seat next to James Corden expecting a huge celebrity hissy fit to kick off Gordon's cabin mates were impressed to see that he didn't say a word or make any sort of complaint he simply put on a pair of noise canceling headphones pulled an eye mask over his eyes and turned away from her to sleep pretty decent of him right when the plane landed though passengers were surprised to see corn remain seated as the woman with the baby struggled to open the overhead Locker even more surprised when she turned according and said for sake can you at least hold the baby while I get the bags down the woman was his wife the baby was his baby so not only is James Gordon apparently a dick to wait staff but he's also a dick to his own family his own wife his own child who he could not bother to help console as she was sobbing on a flight we're dealing with just a a raging Ballad today folks we really are somebody replied and said you can judge a man's character by how he treats a little people and those he won't benefit from I dumped a guy back in the day because he was rude and obnoxious to a waiter that is absolutely a no-go for me and that will be a line that I will draw on the sand because if you cannot have regular human decency and respect for the people in the world around you you have no purpose in my life at all do not need to be around you somebody said I appreciate that he's not even mean and like the movie Star Diva sort of way but in like an 80 year old regular whose benefits are running up so he orders the cheapest thing on the menu and tries to weasel out of paying sort of way absolutely accurate another person said cats used to be the most publicly humiliating thing he's done and now it's groveling for forgiveness after being denied eggs but we're not done yet guys because then Tick Tock started taking off with a bunch of videos and my very favorite was actually from one of the wives of the try guys not Ned who just [\u00a0__\u00a0] over his wife and cheated on her uh but Becky the wife of Keith they're very adorable if they ever break up I will never believe in love that sort of thing anyway she posted this video okay there's definitely something that celebos need to remember and it's that servers never forget um I was a waitress at a super bougie Beverly Hills Hotel rooftop restaurant for about two years weighed on a ton of celebrities um some were really awesome super super nice some were total trash and I remember to this day who those trash bags are because I always lock it up there um so I'm not surprised by all this James Corden information coming out because if you are rude to one server you are absolutely rude to many servers like that is not just like a one-off I was having a bad day kind of thing that's like you are trash so here's my James Gordon story it was not from when I was waiting on him um this was actually when I lived in Los files which is like a super hip part of Los Angeles there's a restaurant called little Downs Little Dom's is super famous um lots of celebrities go there all the time now I was walking down the street going to a happy hour with a girlfriend and we walked by Little Dom's and lo and behold who walks out of the restaurant none other than James Corden and I'm like oh my God celebrity sighting I've got it in my head um as I'm approaching I hear James Corden yelling at this bus boy um in my head I'm like oh oh my God what's going on so being the nosy little Nancy I am I obviously be lined straight for them down the street um and I overhear the busboy telling James Corden that Little Dom's is closed right now it's closed right now they close in the middle of the day uh between lunch and dinner and he's telling James Corden that he can get him a reservation you know right when they open um he was trying to be really accommodating and James Corden yells at this bus boy a lot of good I just like capped I kept on going um made it to my happy hour just fine no no incidents there uh because now every time my friends and I are frustrated with something we do shout out a lot of good that does me me a lot of good that does me well apparently I have two new catchphrases because I'm gonna start saying that and bellad like this is just a great day for me I'm moving on from kick rocks and go touch grass now we're saying a lot of good that does me and bellad all because of you James Corden because you broke my heart and you're no longer my favorite late night host somebody replied and said LOL I went on a date with a British guy once who was saying how James Corden is so hated in the UK and that's why he moved here for his career it is true I was seeing a bunch of comments from Brits they are not happy they do not like him they do not think he's funny and that's kind of been something that has been joked about and known for many years but I'm really appreciating that now all of this is coming to light somebody said the list of celebrities I've waited on throughout my years working in OC at the Ritz and many other high-end places is vast most celebrities are nice some are bad tippers however there are a few few celebrities that really take the cake James is one so rude another person said I know this isn't a big thing but when I attended a live taping of his show his friendly bubbly Persona switches off as the camera turns off he didn't shout at anyone but he was not warm to his crew in any way didn't speak to anyone didn't look friendly then again it is TV somebody replied and said yes I had the same experience you never spoke to the audience and it was actually jarring to see him turn off the second the camera stopped every segment and just looked sourly at the floor and refused to look at any employees left me not really feeling good about him this just keeps getting worse for him he is not just terrible to servers and people in the service industry and not only terrible to his wife and children he's also apparently terrible to the people who literally pay his bills but it gets even worse because speaking of his show people then brought up a less than ideal less than good looking clip from the show but this is when the cameras were actually still turned on and he was not able to hide his true colors name two of the cameramen in this room foreign [Applause] [Laughter] so in a game where you either have to drink something like a fish smoothie or bear testicles or whatever weird gross thing they put in front of you he has resigned to drinking the disgusting fish smoothie because he is an indecent human being that can't even be bothered to meet the two cameramen working on his show that evening I do not care if you have a different crew that night it takes literally five seconds to go up to somebody and say hey I'm Brett what's your name thanks for working on the show it's really not that hard to be a respectful person it really is not that hard to be kind and apparently he has a big problem with it it's just embarrassing and it's utterly disrespectful and it all goes back to making sure that we do not have false Idols especially with these celebrities and some of them are wonderful some of them can be good influences some of them seem like great people but there are also many celebrities that are just an exceptional representation of how far our valueless society has fallen and apparently James Corden is one of them I definitely did not know this stuff about his character when I was a fan similar to how I did not know that stuff about Ellen DeGeneres's character when I was a fan but I'm so glad to know now hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "8n7rmcIfDm0": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brad cooper guys it's always a good day when the left is triggered by a public figure and today that public figure is ricky gervais he just had a new comedy special drop on netflix and apparently within the first five minutes he starts making jokes about the trans movement i mean kind of fantastic and pretty up my alley so immediately i was like cool i guess i'll watch and then unsurprisingly went on social media and saw the left melting down about it but before we dive into that make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode okay so to start us off i think we just need to see a few clips from the special so i have some here oh women not all women i i mean the old-fashioned ones you know the old-fashioned women oh god you know the ones with wombs those dinosaurs [Music] no i love the the new whip i know they're new i mean they're great aren't they you know the new ones we've been seeing lately there were the ones with beards and they're as good as they're as good as gold i love them now it's the old fashioned way and now the old fashioned they're like oh they want to use our toilets why shouldn't they use your toilets for ladies they are ladies look at their pronouns what about this person isn't a lady well his penis her penis you figured [Applause] what if he raped me what if she raped you you poor people are so triggered by this clip enough jokes he's literally just repeating leftist talking points in a more comedic manner and they're angry it's like if we take anything they're saying and throw it back at them absolutely lose their mind uh because that's genuinely what he's doing all right there's another one here and we still know so little about the brain and 150 years ago we knew nothing it was just it was all guesswork right and uh like everything was just mental if you weren't a white sort of heterosexual married christian man right if you deviated too far you were mental they just went mental like homosexuality mental mental illness you're putting an asylum for life or worse tortured women who fell pregnant out of wedlock mental asylum for life right and now we understand things more we're more tolerant we i think it's going too far the other way though because now nothing's mental you can't find somebody that someone's nothing is considered mental everything is a syndrome or an addiction or a preference right i could have my legs removed have wheels put on identify as a pram right and if you sound mental you're a bigger right now that's a bit hack that joke now isn't it oh i identify as a thing then right it's a bit old-fashioned right but i'm gonna leave it in to annoy people right because that's the bit that will offend people same as humanity i talk about aids famine cancer the holocaust rape pedophilia but no the one thing you mustn't joke about is identity problems the one thing you should never joke about is the trans issue right they just want to be treated equally i agree that's why i include them but they know i'm joking about all the other stuff but they go no no i must they must be no he must mean that right like like a joke is a window to the comedian's true soul it's just that's just not the case our our take on any view to make the joke funniest i'll pretend to be right-wing i'll pretend to be left-wing i'll pretend to be clever i'll pretend to be stupid whatever makes the joke funnier without prejudice okay full disclosure in real life of course i support trans rights i support all human rights and trans rights are human rights you know live your best life use your preferred pronouns be the gender that you feel that you are but meet me halfway ladies lose the that's all i'm saying so this was the end of his special and it basically summarizes the fact that he knows people are going to be offended he knows people are going to lose their mind over the things that he's saying i feel like this was less of like a huge ending to a comedy special where he's ending on some big joke and more of a thesis in defense of comedy it's just annoying that he had to end his comedy special with basically an explanation of how jokes and how comedy and how humor works not that he had to he chose to he knew that people were going to be triggered by this so he's basically protecting himself he's basically giving himself a soft place to land because he knows that the folks are going to come after him when they literally have not even watched the special so i don't know there's a whole bunch of nuance in here but it's just a sad state of entertainment and humor but we already knew that i see ricky gervais is standing up for the idgaf plus community yeah i don't give a community it's great now obviously the people who did not watch the special are angry and are tweeting relentlessly but interestingly enough the thing that i am seeing circulating around twitter more than angry triggered tweets is people just simply reposting this old video from james a caster he's a comedian and he did a special where apparently he trolled ricky gervais they say whatever they like edgy comedians no one tells them what they can and can't say they walk straight on stage top of their specials sometimes do 10 solid minutes just slagging off transgender people but straight out the gate just making fun of transgender people if people on the internet get upset about it the comedian's always like bad luck that's my job i'm a stand-up comedian i'm meant to challenge people if you don't like being challenged don't watch my shows what's the matter guys to challenging fire that's my job i'm a stand-up comedian i'm meant to challenge people if you don't like being challenged don't watch my shows what's the matter guys too challenging for you that's my job i'm a stand-up comedian i'm meant to challenge people if you don't like being challenged don't watch my shows what's the matter guys to charge it for you oh no it's broken oh yeah because you know it's been long overdue a challenge the trans community oh they've had their guard down for too long if you ask me [Music] and they'll be checking their privilege on the way home now thanks to you your brave little cis boy i used to name one of the comedians that was about in that routine but it always got really awkward in the room so apparently it's 2019 most people still more than happy to laugh at transgender people not as comfortable laughing at ricky gervais yet i've discovered is that supposed to be funny wouldn't really call that uh peak comedy considering the fact that he said the same four lines about six times over screaming and yelling and basically bending his back onto the floor to challenge it for you but i mean the best comedy is supposed to make you uncomfortable like you should be like oh god should i be laughing at that like that's how i feel most days doing this show so i mean i'll give this guy credit for that he did get that right he's just you know has a bad take on it but my favorite comments about this special came from the progressive lgbtqia plus organization glaad and if you don't know what glaad is uh it stands for the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation uh they haven't changed their acronyms recently but i feel like it probably should be expanded to include trans queer pansexual neo pronouns people who identify as inanimate objects but basically it is an organization that monitors media and entertainment to make sure that members of the lgbtq community are not being discriminated against and that there is ample representation so they always have some take about these comedy specials they always have some take about a movie that's you know too straight or whatever so they tweeted out and they said we watched the ricky gervais comedy special on netflix so you don't have to it's full of graphic and dangerous and anti-trans rants masquerading as jokes he also spouts anti-gay rhetoric and spreads inaccurate information about hiv they go on a bit and then they jump to the other part of the thread and they said netflix has a policy that content designed to incite hate or violence is not allowed on their platform but we all know that anti-lgbtq content does exactly that while netflix is home to some groundbreaking lgbtq shows it refuses to enforce its own policy in comedy yet that's because comedy is supposed to be uncomfortable if you have basic sensitive ass comedy nobody's gonna be laughing and netflix is gonna make no money and they're smart enough to know that okay continuing on glad says the lgbtq community and our allies have made it very clear that so-called comedians who spew hate in place of humor and the media companies who give them a platform will be held accountable meanwhile there are plenty of funny lgbtq comedians to support and that's funny thank you glad i hope netflix takes that to heart and every comedy special will now be a woke social justice warrior gay comedian netflix knows i think it's kind of a recent knowledge for them but they know that if you go woke you go broke they literally uh just a couple of weeks ago updated their culture memo and they put a line in there that basically said we do content that you might not agree with and if you are an employee you will be asked to work on you know movies and tv shows and projects that might not align with your values and if you're uncomfortable with that probably isn't the best place to work and i think a lot of this was sparked by the employee outrage with the latest dave chappelle uh comedy special where a bunch of netflix trans activists and all that did like a walk out and they were threatening to leave netflix has basically slammed down the hammer and said get over it we're going to produce this content whether you like it or not now of course that goes to both sides of the political aisle so if you are you know more conservative and you don't want to work on cuties you're probably still going to have to work on that weird child twerking dance movie but i guess at least there's some sort of equality and equality is something that we don't actually see a lot of these days when it comes to ideology and thought so props to netflix for saying this uh and leading the charge because it's long overdue but to close out this episode i thought we should have one more clip from dear ricky's comedy special we all know that he really doesn't give crap about people criticizing him so here is his message to the haters if i say something tonight that's so offensive so often you've never heard anything so off the charts in your life right don't make a scene go to the box office after the show they can't give your money back straight away but there's a form you fill out with the complaint and i take those away and i shut on them that's pretty much my attitude because most the time when people say that you've offended them it's their own problem and nothing that you could do so you know copensath i guess do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode",

than whatever that girl tried to throw so this now has 5.8 million views and the girl in the blue hoodie she works in one of the dorms at the University of Kentucky she is apparently a freshman and this other girl his name is Sophia rosing drunkenly came back to what I think is her dorm and she was very very intoxicated obviously and I think the story is that she didn't have her like student ID card she couldn't get in she was causing all this chaos and as they tried to settle the situation get her where she needed to go this all happened and obviously I am sure you know why this is going viral because she is being incredibly racist and I do not throw around the word racist very often because I think it is overused and people use it politically but this girl is being a [\u00a0__\u00a0] she's being a dick she's intoxicated she doesn't know what's going on and obviously that alcohol removed any filter and she is being an awful person now there is a longer video and I'm not sure if this is before or after this exact interaction happened I think it might be after because in that first video we saw she said hey can you help me get her to a chair like this was going on for a while there's so many different videos of the situation I think in total there's like nine minutes of video footage of her stumbling all over the place grabbing people slamming into things but here's just another one it does come with me she tries to punch somebody [Music] I really don't have any commentary for the situation yet in those videos because I think they speak for themselves but apparently this is not this girl's first time being drunk and going viral this went viral last year through Barstool and allegedly this is the same girl Sophia rosing and apparently she is not just racist but she also is just very entitled tell me she seems Pleasant oh my God I hate people like this is so insufferable this is the worst type of person somebody said her parents are so rich that they couldn't afford to raise her right oh that yeah that is accurate and sadly that's the case for a lot of people to be quite honest here she is apparently earlier being kicked out of a bar in the same outfit this was on Snapchat and somebody said she got kicked out of one of the bars I work at for biting and racial slurs too she was biting people and then here's a video of her back at the dorm getting arrested getting put in handcuffs apparently she tried to swing at the cop she tried to bite the cop [Music] [Laughter] s girl [Laughter] [Music] I'm so sorry my editors are this entire thing's gonna be bleaked foreign like what the hell for the audience what she is saying is just the n-word repeatedly in a sing-songy voice like girl shut up shut up clean up your freaking act oh God people like this insufferable anyway when she was getting arrested I don't know if she did not want to give her name or she was too drunk to realize what was going on both viable options but she did not give her name so she was arrested under Jane Doe but her rap sheet has now gone viral and her name is Sophia rosing it is on it she has been totally doxed now her family's address has been blasted all over Facebook all over Twitter grandparents their phone number was leaked uh they got the phone number of her dad's company and people are going after her and I am not a fan of doxing obviously this girl deserves to be reprimanded she seems like an insufferable horrible person but don't take it out on her freaking grandparents docsing is way too far it is absolutely wrong no matter what side the political aisle you were on whether it be Taylor Lorenz or Libs of tick tock or this girl it's just wrong like leave people alone deal with the situation at hand you don't need to get her freaking grandparents involved okay so moving on to the next chapter of this Saga she was arrested she was put in jail she had some quick like next day Court appointment where her parents paid her ten thousand dollar bail I believe and I think that she just appeared virtually but now she is out somewhere she has her phone her entire Instagram has been wiped she's no longer following anybody all of her posts have been deleted the only thing that is on there are these apologies here's the first one I was under the influence I'm sorry please don't judge me I lost everything nobody can defend you whatsoever obviously look at the videos nobody can defend you but your first thought is I lost everything this is not about you right now at all the next slide is I understand an apology may not help but I am not a racist I was under the influence I lost everything literally and now I have to fear for my life God forgives please understand you understand an apology may not help you haven't even tried you did not apologize you said I lost everything that's not an apology that's not you actually being genuine or taking accountability for your actions at all that's you making this about yourself and feeling sorry for yourself you are not the victim here this one also really got me those two were yesterday this one I saw this morning if you guys knew I was under the influence why record me this was literally my senior year sad face emoji all you care about is losing things and your senior year it seems like she's just angry because she got caught being an unhinged drunk ass [\u00a0__\u00a0] and doesn't want to stop having fun in her senior year of college and news flash in college everybody gets recorded being drunk that's literally what people do if you are intoxicated wandering around your college campus I guarantee somebody has a Snapchat video of you being like look at this funny dude and yeah if you're doing that on top of being a racist and throwing punches of people that are trying to get you into a chair or get you where you need to go they're obviously going to record it people immediately started making this political per usual which is where I find fault with a situation somebody said Mitch better watch out for a primary challenge she's about to be the GOP front runner in 2024. somebody else said good no sympathy here she's now qualified to work for Fox News or any Republican campaign people are also saying things like this I figured being a racist is a requirement for most Kentucky schools this actually reminds me of when I was at UCLA and I was literally told that I was a racist simply because my family is from the south and I was raised in Tennessee I was at a party at one point and I had gotten there late my friends were already there one of them stood up on a table pointed me out and said look there's our racist friend Brett from Tennessee come on in and they were saying it ingest but they were also drunkenly standing up on a table pointing out and saying that I was racist it was at that party too that I got hit in the head with the Communist Manifesto so but anyway contrary to popular belief everyone and I'm sure you all have common sense you know this racism is not a Republican Party platform people are just dicks there is racism on every side of the political aisle there are [\u00a0__\u00a0] on every side of the political aisle I don't know how clear I need to be this is not a political situation this is a drunk girl being unhinged who is an entitled [\u00a0__\u00a0] getting called on her [\u00a0__\u00a0] rightfully so but this story is not finished yet because the campus employee from that initial video Kyla spring did an explanation video immediately after the event she was one who posted these original videos and this explanation has apparently gotten taken down from tiktok multiple times so I'm glad that it's on Twitter so we can all watch it here we go okay so last night I was at work and I'm a desk clerk here at the University of Kentucky there was a girl she came in drunk and when she came in drunk she was looking at the elevator and she was like stumbling and she started talking to Oliver and she was like I'm gonna effing um in June basically like I'm gonna into like off you I stuck my head out the window I was like are you okay um like what's going on and that's when the N word the b word those racial slurs and things started coming out so I was like okay let me call the ra and so in between the time of the ra getting down the girl has called me the n-word and the word multiple times um she's punched me twice at this point she's bidding on my arm a few times as well as kick me in my stomach um and then she tried to run me and my friend over with a shopping cart my friend also was experiencing these things um I'm choosing to keep her name private until she decides that she wants to say something about it because I feel like her experience is her experience and I cannot speak for her so we finally get the ra to come down and the girls start saying things like do my chores it's not my fault that you're black it's not my fault that you're ugly um and then she just keeps like at this point she's like singing the n-word um multiple people trying to get this girl to be quiet she bit a color up she bit a couple of other people um who are trying to basically calm her down and so long story short the police finally came um she would not give them their name so if you guys see anything about her being registered in the system as Jane Doe that was because she was refusing to give a name she didn't have her phone she didn't have an ID or anything um but then she was continuously um just saying the words saying it out loud um she ended up actually kicking a police officer biting a police officer um they finally took her away but um I just find the situation very unfortunate the problem here is that this happens way too much on college campuses for things to not be done and we get these emails and everything about how they don't tolerate it but it's still happening and I feel like at this point the attention needs to be shifted from the offenders to the offended so please do your best to just continue to share these videos out thank you guys so much for any support that you've been um giving to me given to my friend giving to the University of Kentucky students and hopefully we'll be able to get Justice Rose thank you okay so I was with this girl for the entire time she was calm and collected everything that she is saying in this video in the story time lines up with what we saw in those videos of the girl I agree with her I think that she handled the situation as well as she could she called the right people like all in all this is very solid but she did lose me a bit at the end when she was saying like justice needs to be served and this happens all too often on college campuses it really doesn't what actually happens on college campuses is there stupid people that get ridiculously drunk and are incredibly irresponsible get kicked out of bars without their phone without their ID and are stumbling around being dangerous making themselves into victims and doing stupid [\u00a0__\u00a0] like this and if racist things to this extent were actually happening on college campuses all the time we would be hearing about it on a daily basis because like I said especially on college campuses literally everything in 2022 is on camera and is filmed because racism is not a taboo subject it's not flying under the radar anywhere in this socio-political climate racism is thrown around like a political weapon that's why when I said at the beginning I don't often call things racist but this actually was but I don't often call things racist because it is so overused and like I said if this was actually happening every single day we would be seeing all of these videos because they will take any opportunity they can to prove the necessity of BLM to prove the necessity of electing all Progressive Democrat leaders that are going to solve racism and make everybody read anti-racist baby books whatever ever it is there's a reason why this singular incident in this singular video was going so viral and everybody is upset about it because this is a rarity drunk ass [\u00a0__\u00a0] on college campuses No but somebody being like this that's her just being a racist [\u00a0__\u00a0] so if she's obviously getting a ton of press right now there was even an anti-racism March for her and the other girls involved that was held at the University of Kentucky and she gave a little speech here's just the end of that and to miss rosing you will not break my spirit foreign like I said opportunities now on Sophia's end she is getting the full cancellation like she was saying she lost everything I mean she really is like I said her family has been docs which I didn't agree with for the past couple of years she has also been like a college influencer of sorts she was on the roster of this like influencer marketing organization called campus fashionistas or something I don't know but the biggest brand that she represented was Dillard's and they have promptly cut all ties with her somebody tweeted this out and said are you all aware that one of your ambassadors who attends the University of Kentucky assaulted and hurled racial slurs at a black student they quickly replied and said Dillard's does not condone this Behavior her relationship with Dillard's has been terminated immediately I'm not surprised by that whatsoever that's not shocking I don't hate it like I said the girl's unhinged this really is a wild situation and it's just getting started because this only happened over the weekend I'm sure it is going to keep spiraling we're probably going to learn a lot more but what I keep coming back to and what really annoys me about this whole situation and the response to the situation is how political people are making it the people are saying that Sophia rosing must be a Republican and if this is Republican Behavior and the Kyla spring is immediately leaning into BLM rhetoric and trying to grow this into a big social justice movement this is just the case of a drunk spoiled racist College brat and a girl that actually handled herself with Incredible composure and Grace but is now getting thrown into a political agenda because it is opportune for the left it's really quite predictable it was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "ua1qwnQ-kTI": "I feel like I'm drinking uggs and a North Face I'm just a 16 year old white girl my whole life's ahead of me right now [Applause] [Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock today I have a special guest with me it's the one and only Michael Knowles stop it right well last week I did a video where I did a ranking of the best fast food restaurants and it did exceedingly well so I thought well now I need to do another ranking video and I decided I need to do coffee but I needed it to be a little more specific hence pumpkin spice lattes because I think this video is going to come out on the first day of fall actually is it not already for because as far as I'm concerned August 31st right we're kind of around Labor day but more importantly that is the day that Starbucks brings back the PSL as far as I'm concerned that is the first day that's an incredible argument so because of that we've already passed then the first day of fall but Michael if you've been watching a show if you follow any of his social media you know that he is a an Aficionado yes yes of sorts of pumpkin spice lattes and so today we are going to go out into Nashville and try every single pumpkin spice latte that we can find we're going to let you know which one is the best but I have a special surprise for you because no yeah because I was I was going to make you drive in your Honda Civic but I thought that's just to me we're at the daily Wire yeah we got money coming out of our ears Jeremy boring is our CEO so I it's like I got us a limo that's good that's good because you want to be really inconspicuous you know because all you know all these coffee shops are super lib this this is pretty sweet digs and what's nice is there are enough cup holders for all of them that was kind of my thought process Toyota for an event that is as luxurious as a pumpkin spice latte to your ranking you need to have a car like you got a ball out we do foreign [Music] our first one Cheers To Your Health yep that's very interesting because what I'm my first hit here it's not so much the pumpkin as almost like a marshmallow yeah a caramel caramelized like a caramelized marshmallow so I like it I like it but it would be as if we were going around testing all the stakes of Nashville and then someone served me a nice piece of salmon like it could maybe this is good salmon but I'm here for the steak yeah you're right it doesn't have a hit of pumpkin it's more like a sugar autumn beverage yeah leaning dare I say winter I'm not mad about it though but I do feel myself vibrating already drinking this because of the sugar not because of the coffee I'm always just sort of vibrating that's true [Music] we're here at ugly mug this is the world renowned Coffee Spot the 2018 winner of the greatest coffee roaster in the state of Tennessee it's a big deal it's a big deal it's famous around Nashville there's a couple locations it's excellent coffee cheers let's see I haven't tried it yet that's warm fitbitter bitter or thinner both it has a cut to it yeah it does it's less sickeningly sweet than the last one smells like candy it feels more like coffee and they like held a pumpkin over the top of it like they carved a Jack-o-Lantern took a big Huff of it like paint fumes when you're a kid and then just sort of went like yeah I'm kind of I feel a bit let down I dig it though because I really I can't I'm not a big sugar guy you know really yeah as an Italian I'm more like fatty meats and cheese so when I want I want my pumpkin spice to leave me wanting more alrighty [Music] oh that's good that's very good that's a kind of nice Middle Ground yeah between the heavy marshmallowy sweetness of the first and the kind of more coffee for a word of the second I feel the bite of the coffee which is needed because I know I'm getting caffeinated but then it's followed up by a nice it's very it's spiced it really is it's more spiced than sugary I want to know whether they actually use real pumpkin or whether it's just pumpkin spice I wondered that to me this tastes like it could be real broken yeah but I don't know now the one knock on this place they've got one of these stupid compostable lid things I think this is my top pick so this is my top pick I agree thank you [Music] I feel all I got was foam on that one yeah try it again I'm gonna try it again okay so it's already looking creamier nice little light dusting on top very creamy heavy yep very yeah it's I'm not you hate it you hate it as do I I know we can be real out of milk it's a lot it's a glass of milk with a hint of spice coffee on to the next on to the next [Music] foreign we're at Sam and Zoe's which is actually one of my very favorite local spots in Nashville mine is kind of a slightly mushy asymmetrical heart yours did not make it mine no I also don't really have a lot in here they they kind of skimped me they did I got the rest okay I like that oh I like that a lot yeah that might be up there with Crema oh yeah for sure for sure I think it's a little watery and that's my only complaint and a little sweet yeah where the crema one was both thicker and and less overpowering you had the balance of coffee and spice this is more sweet with a bite of coffee but a tad bit watered down it's good it's very good yeah that's it I don't want to criticize it it's good but it's not the best yeah foreign Michael cheers alrighty it's from the well in Nashville so what's the deal with the whale it's a charity or something I believe it's a non-profit coffee shop and it benefits wells in Africa that's good but my problem is how it's very slow and I think that's probably because it's a non-profit because capitalism moves faster other people have no motivation I thought you were going to get into some African stuff and I was like yeah you listen Brett come on that's not that's not that kind of good grief you've got a little wild in here I found this tiara you would think we're drunk but we're dressed no I do love that this this limo has been used for a sweet 16. this is a very good one I like that it's a I like that it's for a good cause even if it takes a little longer yet it's easy to drink I feel like I'm pretty much Mother Teresa I feel like I am personally building wells in Africa that is the The Virtue signaling this is a good one benefit yeah it's not flavor it's wow and I love they've gone very heavy on the spice topping that's good and the shape of it's very beautiful it's solid easy drinking with a good cause I want the well to sponsor me yeah I get free coffee although if it's a charity aren't we supposed to sponsor the well it doesn't work out for me [Music] this is the Fiesta resistance now you'll notice it's a little different this is a cold drink because I actually don't think it's fair to put Starbucks even in the category you know it's gonna be number one yes this is the OG and by the way I know they say it's a woke Corporation it's liberal I don't care I don't care if they trans all the kids I don't care if they donate all their money the line of the sand has been a race yes it just doesn't they're the OG they make okay so this is the best version of it I think it's the light pumpkin cream foam light pumpkin topping one pump vanilla pumpkin cream cold brew latte Cheers Cheers we made it this was so good oh yeah I could I feel like I'm drinking Uggs in a North Face I feel like I'm back in an infinity scarf yes and an infinity scarf back in Westchester County I'm just a 16 year old white girl my whole life's ahead of me right now where's that sweet 16 Tiara oh here we go yeah I feel like this 16 again I've had four of these this week not of not of your creation but this is my fall drink I don't even do the hot lattes the lattes were putting me asleep to be honest the warm beverage because even though we're doing fall drinks it is 90 degrees in Nashville because of obviously of the global warming you know obviously so we make two we adapt putting Starbucks aside what yes okay number one of the non-star boxes cream and number two salmon Zoe's number three was the well the will the well because in addition to being good it also has the

because they're raping everybody out here i am never gonna financially recover from this welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper i'm going to do it again i'm going to talk about something that i am not 100 educated on but i will take a very passionate stance on it regardless we're going to do more superhero movies because last week we talked about warner brothers canning batgirl after spending 80 million dollars and the film was basically finished and i mentioned the drama going around about ezra miller and the upcoming flash movie now this is all kind of interconnected because they're trying to create this trifecta of female superheroes in a way with batgirl and then the flash is gonna come out and in the flash they're gonna introduce supergirl which is a film that is in pre-production but where batgirl only had a budget of 80 million dollars the flash had a budget of 200 million dollars so this is a much bigger investment for warner brothers which is why the stakes are so much higher with this particular film however the lead actor ezra miller has been in the spotlight for some unsightly things over the past year to put it mildly and we're back with some updates the new york post tweeted out yesterday uh warner brothers may pull the flash amid ezra miller's legal woes so to fully understand we need to dive into these legal woes again to put all of this lightly ezra miller was charged with a felony burglary on monday over missing bottles of alcohol from a local home in vermont where he was staying two days later child services in vermont said that they were attempting to locate a mother and three children who have allegedly been residing at miller's drug and gun-filled vermont farmhouse according to rolling stone he was also arrested in hawaii back in march for disorderly conduct and in april for a second-degree assault he was also accused of being the subject of 10 calls to 9-1-1 in less than a month while living in hawaii miller was also involved in a bizarre incident earlier this year in which the star who goes by they them pronouns allegedly groomed young girls in a cult-like situation we're just gonna dabble that in a cult like yeah apparently he has a sex cult that he has been running in iceland yeah no wonder they're thinking of canning the flash because how are they going to release this film when they literally have a criminal at the forefront of it i mean listen harvey weinstein did all of that  for literally decades and all of his films got produced so we know that hollywood's standards are literally on the ground but the internet has really taken this story and run with it and if we have learned anything from this year from you know morbius and the minions movie what happens on social media really dictates whether a film is going to have any kind of success or flop so with all the press ezra is getting it's not looking too good but what they left out of this article is that ezra is currently on the run because he is also being accused of not just running a sex call doing all of that but grooming an individual native american girl she's 18 or 19 now but this all started when she was 15. i mean he literally like plucked her off the reservation at 15 years old started flying her all over the world to be on movie sets with him because apparently she was a fan of his was writing him letters and then somehow got involved like guys i love my subscribers i think you all are fantastic i'm not a creep there's no way in hell that i would like fly people here and like it's just so weird but what i will do is give you the opportunity to hang out with me over zoom and we can do that if you buy a box of meat from good ranchers because good ranchers which you all know is my very very favorite meat delivery service is on a mission to donate 100 000 meals to children in need in this back to school season and to help them out i'm inviting 10 of my subscribers to come hang out with me over zoom on september 29th you guys can ask me anything we'll make some steak we'll cook it'll be a great time and all of this is to help good ranchers on their goal to make this happen go to goodranchers.com use promo code cooper where you can get 30 off plus free shipping on your goodrancher's order and be entered into this super fun challenge we can hang out we get to help kids in need it'll be a great time plus you guys get steaks we can even sit around and talk about our favorite internet stories there might even be weirder stuff that ezra miller has done we can dish about that and i promise i won't groom you or do any freaky stuff like ezra miller did i mean guys he literally kept this girl from her parents and stopped her from getting any kind of identification he also came out for her and said oh she's non-binary and queer now and the parents have now been able to get a restraining order and they've gotten their daughter back but ezra is on the run so the papers have not been served they really don't know i'm fastest friend that is happening and warner brothers is frantically trying to figure out how they can you know spin and save this pr nightmare and not lose even more money after they just lost 80 million dollars with batgirl according to discussing film which is a great twitter account these are the options that warner brothers are considering one ezra miller giving an interview explaining their erratic behavior and then doing limited press i can't wait to see him on freaking jimmy fallon being like oh yeah you know me grooming those girls i'll just go home now no and yes i'm going to use he him pronouns because why are we delicately traipsing around this creepy grooming man i don't give a crap about his stupid pronouns and going oh he goes by they them we need to respect that no i'm not going to respect it he's sexually abusing women i'm not gonna treat him with respect my god okay moving on number two ezra miller plays no part in the film's promotion that's a little better than him doing some weird late night special number three they completely scrapped the film which feels like it might be the best option at this point it would be a terrible business decision but when you weigh it with having like a confirmed rapist groomer pedophile freak starring in your film it's like reputation or money you kind of have to choose i guess but who could anticipate you the internet has been very locked in on the story so they have thoughts as all of this is unraveling somebody said i want to see them go for scenario one purely to see how they can spin ezra miller's rampage into something even remotely understandable i mean yeah like i said i don't really want this but like in a twisted way i would love to see him on jimmy fallon or james corden doing like the fill your guts or spill your guts game like ezra are you gonna tell us if you actually groomed that girl and he's like now i'll just eat the weird like chicken liver instead like it's all so corrupt and fueled by propaganda who are we kidding the flash movie must be so gas ezra miller could literally kill a minority right now and it's still not getting cancelled i wonder if they're not canceling it because he's non-binary it's like oh we can't we can't cancel a film with a non-binary in it they already canceled a film with a minority female lead warner brothers is you know trashing themselves in the woke world i guess uh another person said at this point i'd be more interested in a film about ezra miller's descent into madness and the flash movie literally yes i'm waiting for this to happen i need the uh amber heard johnny depp trial in like an hbo mini series format and then i also need like a dark hbo ezra miller deep dive it's gonna be so creepy and i wanna watch it every time i see the words ezra miller i know it's about to be followed by the strangest combination of crime and location again sex cult in iceland don't understand how that happened you know i just bet we should have tried left at albuquerque every time i see a new ezra miller story i think it surely can't be worse than the last one and every time i am wrong literally yes as well this one's good um jp says i hate feeling so powerless in the face of global problems plagues climate change ezra miller he's terrorizing women and children literally around the world i think i'm more at a risk of getting terrorized by ezra miller than i am of like coveted monkey pox to be quite honest and climate change like we should be more concerned about freaks like him than all of that crap another person said an app that warns you if you are in close proximity of ezra miller god i mean like the funny thing is i literally am mentioning this every day but they just hired those 87 000 irs agents who are supposed to be tracking our venmo payments they can literally track us down with their ar-15s if we don't file our taxes but no one can seem to find and serve ezra miller they survey american citizens on a daily basis thanks to the stupid patriot act but they can't find ezra miller and his sex cults like you literally had 10 9-1-1 calls about him in hawaii and then he went off to vermont and is now terrorizing women and children there what the hell is going on it's a typical double standard but are we surprised because it's hollywood and they almost always protect their elite money makers and they find ways to excuse or hide their terrible behavior until like they self-implode basically again harvey weinstein i really have no idea what is going to happen with this what scenario warner brothers is going to choose and as somebody that is very much outside of that whole superhero dc marvel world i don't have any kind of emotional investment in this film if it doesn't come out that's fine i'd probably prefer it because i don't want to you know give amplification to a grooming pedophile freak but from my outsider's perspective it is very clear to me that warner brothers is an absolute show right now so it's probably good that this new ceo is in because i think you know warner brothers and discovery merged there's new leadership they're clearing house he's apparently a little bit based so it's a mess right now but maybe this will be worth something in the end maybe they'll cancel all these films get out all the pedophiles and things will be better i don't know you guys let me know what you think in the comments if you were excited about this if you've spotted ezra miller somewhere if you're in vermont maybe you can leave a tip in the in the comments for the fbi i don't know do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "FOc8pdUFxGw": "would you rather have a raging blue-haired lib daughter or a soy boy beta [\u00a0__\u00a0] husband [Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock guys we just finished filming comment section and now I have been told that apparently my entire team has sent in would you rather questions so sheller is going to read them to me and I guess I'm gonna be exposed I hope these are good every time I've done would you rather they're pretty simple and I wouldn't be bothered either way so I'm ready for you guys to have brought the heat I would say a good 86 percent of them are pretty good that uh 14 I want to know who sent those in I'll fire them you're fired first one would you rather wake up naked one mile from your house or in your underwear at work I make uh naked a mile from my house well why um because I'm not around people I work with but I feel like it's difficult too because anywhere I am there's the possibility that somebody knows who I am but also if I just woke up like a naked a mile from my house around like a 12 minute mile I could Sprint that back home and I would just look like another crackhead on like the side of the road in Nashville so I think that's a better bet and then I would not have to scar anybody I work with would you rather never be able to scratch and itch or never be able to pop a pimple oh God I guess I'd rather I'd want to be able to scratch the itch my cousin actually is a doctor she's about to finish up her residency and when she was in med school I was in town visiting her and that side of my family when she was doing her Dermatology unit and we put Dr pimple popper up on their like huge flat screen HD TV and we both sat there like oh my God this is so cool the rest of the family was absolutely disgusted even though that is the case it's better if I'm not popping my own pimples so I'd rather be able to scratch would you rather find 200 floating in a public toilet or five dollars in your pocket five dollars my pocket well originally the number was going to be 500. in the toilet still would be five dollars in my pocket if it was like entirely filled with hundred dollar bills like you could not even see the water then I'd be like then I would say I would phone a friend I would phone Madison because she'd be up for these hijinks and I would say Madison pick up a strainer and we just scoop and then we could be spraying with some hand sanitizer let it dry but I would need to have a partner in crime who would be down for that and it would need to be like wow this is an overwhelming amount of hundred dollar bills so yeah I think that's the only way that it would be worth it to me because then it would be you know a substantial amount because we have to be real like it is Biden's economy inflation is skyrocketing that could be you know some good cushion money some good money for your savings hedge against inflation even though we all know the best hedge against inflation is investing in precious metals and the best way to do that is with bullion Max Boolean Max is a direct to Consumers precious metals retailer that makes it super easy to start diversifying your portfolio you can buy everything online without ever talking to a salesperson and they will ship your Metals directly to your door fully insured and just for my viewers I have put together a special patriotic starter kit so if you want to check it out and claim your deal today go to booleanmax.com Cooper again that is bullionmax.com Cooper I don't know whether I would want to like fish out precious metals out of a toilet it just feels like you'd have to really reaching it like it's more difficult to like scoop it where I feel like you could do that with the bills I'm kind of getting graphic now it just feels like physically that would not be as pleasant in the grand scheme of fishing things out of a toilet but anyway let's just move on would you rather accidentally fart in front of Ben Shapiro or trip and fall on your face in front of Matt Walsh I would rather trip and fall in front of Matt Walsh because I think Matt would just look at me and go okay whatever and move on I also trip and fall a lot the other day I was at a coffee shop in East Nashville and I was like throwing away my cup of coffee for the morning and then I was gonna walk in and get my other cup of coffee and I was like leaning over to the trash can and I tripped and fell and I was directly in front of the window where all the people were sitting at the bar like on their laptop staring directly out and I was like face down that happens more than I would like to admit so I feel like it's more likely that would happen farting in front of Ben I don't see Ben enough he's in Florida that would just be not a good look but girls don't fart right they don't they don't poop either but but when you fall in your face like that's physical harm so you'd rather have that than like just farting in front of someone yes okay okay like that day I had like my knee was bleeding when I walked in to pick up that coffee that is the thing that I am proud of I did not just turn around and go back in my car I walked in that restaurant because I had pre-ordered the cup of coffee I walked in there did not look at any of those people but I got my coffee cheers would you rather meet your hero and find out they're a terrible person or never meet your hero and they think you are a terrible person I would rather meet my hero and figure out that he's a terrible person if they are a terrible person I don't want to have a false idol I would rather learn that readjust and find somebody else to look up to I just think that would be smarter would you rather be stranded on a desert island with Joe Biden or AOC AOC because Joe Biden would drag me down or get lost somewhere and cause me more harm even though AOC is incredibly annoying I think I could kiss her ass enough that we could like have a good time and she is physically able to like help do things we were just on an island I get along with basically anybody if we don't have to talk about like those substantive issues I don't care at least I'll have somebody to talk to other than that I'll probably go crazy and become like an insane person talking to a tree that's pretty much the exact thing that I told Bobby when he was filling this out I said to him well Biden is probably going to die within three days of heat stroke so yeah yeah I would rather talk with AOC than me alone would you rather wear jeans two sizes too small or shoes two sizes too small jeans two sizes too small because let's be honest if you're a girl you're probably already wearing jeans that are two sizes too small at least one size too small in shoes I move around too much my feet would be in pain also with jeans you can always do the I'm a dinner and I'm eating just unzip the top of it like if you're a girl like you can't like don't lie to me I know we've all done it we wear our eating pants I have my sitting jeans and my standing jeans my standing jeans they are the two sizes too small I have my sitting jeans I'm wearing some sitting jeans right now that I know are a little looser I can sit like this I can have the leg up but sometimes I accidentally wear my standing jeans out and then I end up at dinner and it's like oh God you know bye-bye belt would you rather live in California and get 50 million new subs or stay in Nashville and get no more new Subs maybe California because I know that the 50 million more subs would open up a lot of doors and financially would probably be better for me and then if you make a lot of money in California obviously the people are still morons but it's much easier to live there being like a middle class person or like a student like I was it's not fun it's not really enjoyable so if I knew that financially I grew with that 50 million Subs then maybe California but if not like I don't want to go back to California the only way I would go back was if I was like physically forced to or if I was like a Jeff Bezos type of person where I would like not have to be like avoiding stepping in poop on Hollywood Boulevard would you rather have one dog that lives as long as you or five dogs that only live 10 years one dog that lives down as me I would not if you had told me I would need to get rid of one of my two dogs in order to have that I would say no and I would have the five dogs I could find my dog Ollie that I got when I was four lived my entire life I'd be totally happy would not need another dog would you rather live in a blue State and be wildly successful or live in a red State and not succeed at all this is kind of a companion question yes it depends on like how successful like is successful I guess because if it's just like oh I'm accomplishing some things I'm sustainable I'd probably say red State because I know that I would be emotionally happier I would be Freer but again like Jeff Bezos David dobrik YouTuber level it says you would be wildly successful mildly then maybe a blue State I guess again I think it's just based on you know can I avoid it it would be more comfortable to live in a blue State then would you rather have a permanent unibrow or no eyebrows unibrow there's a couple of models out there in this whole like body positivity sphere that have unibrows and the more I look at them I'm like okay well it's not the worst thing in the world like they pull it off because they're kind of like avant-garde looking I just don't think that I would look good with no eyebrows I think my eyebrows are already like so dark and heavy set anyway that just like filling them in probably wouldn't change too much but it would be drastically I think if I got rid of them totally I would look like a ghost I think we have to do some photo shopping holy Jesus this is our favorite one by the way would you rather have a raging blue-haired lib daughter or a soy boy beta [\u00a0__\u00a0] husband it's tough on one hand the person that I'm gonna like spend the rest of my life with my companion I don't want to be a soy boy beta [\u00a0__\u00a0] and I would divorce him most likely if that's how it turned out if I had the more masculine based husband and then I had the blue-haired liberal daughter you know I'm still her mother Ike maybe could still have some influence I would rather not have the soy boy husband I just think I would have a better chance at fixing the blue-haired kid and then not having one at all if I did not have a soy boy beta [\u00a0__\u00a0] husband would you rather know when you're going to die or how you're going to die I'd rather know when then at least I know how much time I have left to accomplish the things that I want to do and say the things that I want to say if I just know how I'm going to die then I would be living every day like if I was gonna drown or whatever like I'm never gonna get on a boat I'm gonna be too scared to live life to the fullest or if it's like you're gonna die in a car crash or something like that I would never want to get into a car you might have a brain aneurysm okay well then do I just need to like sit still and never do anything I I think I would be probably like more crippled by you know not knowing when it was going to happen would you rather go vegan for one month or give up your favorite drink for a year what is my favorite drink coffee I'd probably give it my favorite drink because my favorite drink really isn't that healthy my coffee's not really that good for you another favorite drink of mine is sweet tea That's not great for you we're talking about an alcoholic beverage alcohol in general is not good for you so giving that up would probably be beneficial to my health so if I had to get rid of like a Tennessee mule so be it would you rather gain 5 million new Subs but you can only use your phone for five minutes a day or you can use your phone as much as you would like but you're capped at 100K Subs I would be fine only using my phone minutes a day because a lot of the stuff that I do on my phone is for work Instagram Community posts being on YouTube finding content if I could have the same sort of success rate and not have to do that I more than five that's totally fine I'll like use five minutes to text my mom who lives far away but other than that like I really don't text my friends that are here in person very much because I'll just go and talk to them also some of the people that I love like actually work at Daily wire so I'll just walk over and say hi would you rather have your first child at 21 or 50. 21 absolutely I mean biologically and physically I would be in a much better place to have a child at this age than at 50 it's just much like less risky I was listening to my Walsh's wife talking and she's had kids you know in her 20s and then now she's having twins later on and she was saying this is a totally different experience like have kids young so that and then I also would want to be able to spend more time with him like my mom was older when she had me not like as old as 50. but I do think about it all the time that like had I been her first child my brother was 14 years older than me obviously his head and will have more time with her would you rather date a liberal and go to Machu Picchu or data conservative and never go to Machu Picchu I would rather date a conservative and never go my happiness that I know I will feel at Machu Picchu my whole life has led up to that moment of me going there because like you know I've wanted to go since fifth grade however that is fleeting I will leave there and I will have new destinations that I want to travel to but knowing me and if I date to Mary if I'm gonna be dating and conservative and I'm thinking about like a long-term plan that is going to be like long-term fulfillment and happiness and if I'm dating a liberal just to go to Machu Picchu number one that's just a bad look for me number two I'd probably kill him I love how fast you answer that oh yeah 100 I would I would give it up I would give it up would you rather watch only horror movies forever or C-SPAN forever probably C-SPAN I just can't do it and with I fall asleep like within 10 minutes of a movie coming on well with C-SPAN I would at least be somewhat informed about things a little bit would you rather talk like Yoda or breathe like Darth Vader talk like Yoda because everybody would think that I was just like being a meme basically or was super into Star Wars would you rather ride a horse 30 miles to work every day or walk five miles to work every day ride the horse that's a no-brainer yeah would you rather always have wet socks or a small rock in your shoe oh a small rock in my shoe just the the moistness of the socks and thinking about like that squish sound it's like when you've been at a theme park and you get on a water ride when you don't think they're going to be getting on a water ride and you stay pretty dry but a little bit of water gets on your shoes and you're walking around you see like oh I can like shake my foot every few minutes and like Kick the rock to the side and it'll be fun the squish also The Athlete's Foot that would come with that oh and finally okay would you rather go skydiving with a suspiciously packed shoot or go swimming in a known shark infested area swimming in a shark infested area because the Sharks might not attack me it's our friends not food could be fine skydiving I feel like I would be you're already at a risk when you Skydive uh suspiciously you know packed thing that just makes your chances even worse also the breed of shark matters like if it's like oh the worst like they're bred to kill okay you know but just like normal sharks that's fine that concludes our game of would you rather this is like a nice calming entry to the week I feel relaxed and I'm impressed with the questions you guys came up with and the team did those are good they know me well if you guys have any would you rather questions that you wish I'd answered put them in the comments and I'll go through and I'll try to reply to some of them and I'll let you know what I think because I enjoy this it'll be great before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not already subscribed to this Channel and ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "jqViy5A1LHI": "all right I love this video so much yeah the best part about this is that he isn't doing some big movement to be like oh let me move and have you sit down it's like a creepy like come speak to me please come sit with me it's so it's just ridiculous and I absolutely love it the eye contact chef's kiss well plain haha until someone with anxiety doesn't want to upset you and does sit down yeah that'd probably be the only way that would not work somebody said it doesn't work for women yeah no that's true you can't sit with us a guy would immediately sit down 100 percent", "S7vsxtrXa9c": "this is a zombie incense he's not alive but incredibly he's not dead either no body ew only one wing in his crawl get why why is that guy touching it although it's still alive its organism is slowly being divided okay i can't even do this y'all this is more concerning to me than covet or monkey pox i don't get squirmish around bugs but this that freaks me out and this is coming from somebody who literally collected cockroaches when she was like eight years old i have several questions somebody said government has entered the chat yeah no i would not be surprised if this was somebody else me going to work yeah literally this is what i look like when i stumble into hair and makeup every day at 7am", "NV7SXlUyjGw": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper happy Monday everybody I hope you all had a fantastic weekend last night I saw one of my very favorite bands in the entire world there's a bit of a twist with that story so I think I might actually do a whole episode about it because it's kind of wild spend some time with the dogs it got freaking cold in Nashville so I'm very chilly but anyway I hope you all had a fantastic weekend we are getting into a story that I have actually wanted to talk about for a few days now I was not in on Friday so I was not able to talk about it then so I swapped it into Monday I'm very excited because in New Hampshire a man has just won a women's pageant but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com to check out my merch collection I think everything is officially shipping out now I've seen people posting in their hoodies and the Polaroid shirts and everything I am super stoked so if you've not gotten things yet now is a great time to do what you can get it before the holidays because things are shipping here is the first news story that I saw this was on Wednesday November 9th and it says transgender her model wins local Miss America pageant for the first time ever so this is not only just this transgender model's first time but this in the whole Miss America Pageant they have actually only had biological females win quite based honestly up until this point I can't believe that that is something that I'm saying is space but you know what in 2022 that's kind of where we're at right now here is the video that went viral of this dude being crowned let's just watch can we skip to the good part [Music] this is just a really weird freaking world it's so strange I don't want to live on this planet anymore the capture on this video this is on Twitter says Brian nugen is a man who just won a female beauty pageant I'm sure he earned his win in him being trans at absolutely zero Factor whatsoever in the fact that a chubby dude won a beauty pageant over a bunch of healthy and real girls first of all I'm just immediately distracted like dude please put on a shirt I can literally send you an Amazon link to help you out I do not want to see any of this by the way guys did you know that over 60 of products on Amazon are sold by third party Sellers and that 50 of those sellers are based in China these foreign sellers don't pay taxes or create jobs in the U.S they just overcharge you for cheap products that is why I use cultivate cultivate is a completely free browser extension that shows you where product listings on Amazon come from and where you can find cheaper local alternatives for example I went ahead and found this person a t-shirt I quickly just activated cultivate I can already see that this is from China I go to the get locally section and they tell me that I can get it for almost 11 cheaper at my local Target plus cultivate has the school Rewards program where the more that you use cultivate the more money you earn towards donations for a charity of your choice use my special link wecultivate.us Cooper to download cultivate for free save money and support your local economy again that's wecultivate.us slash Cooper to download somebody said makes mental note to avoid Derry New Hampshire somebody else said I swear women fought for their rights why are they okay with men taking their rights their opportunities while rubbing it in their face because apparently women are stupid all of those girls stood on that stage and like cheered like little seals like oh I'm so excited that this man is taking my spot I am so excited that a biological man is in a women's pageant what no this next comment I think he thought it was greater Dairy I know that it's not funny to explain uh a joke but I think that's kind of necessary maybe it's not you guys probably are all smart and got it somebody else said a scholarship for women and girls going to men this isn't a misogynistic movement at all yeah right this should be common sense that this is absolutely ridiculous Brienne formerly Brian and they kept the spelling so it's still Brian he's 19 years old and has amassed a mask the jokes just keep coming in Brandon's not really a model even though a lot of the mainstream media is calling Brands some kind of model bran is just kind of burst onto the scene as a transgender person who takes pictures of themselves and gets a lot of accolades on social media from the Clapping liberal seals that want brownie points here's another video of him prepping for pageant season this was last year this is probably his most viral video but he's been doing this for a bit the caption is POV you're at a pageant rehearsal and not giving anything to the other girls don't see you as a threat Gaslight love this gaslighting girl bossing and gatekeeping to the nines I mean I do need to give brand credit because Brian here wears heels better than a lot of women I will say he is holding himself up that is impressive now obviously this is all made the rounds on social media I have another Tick Tock here because people have now found this story and are calling out the absolute Ridiculousness of it either America has lost his goddamn mind or this is just a joke okay I don't know how this dude entered the Miss America Pageant and won but I'm assuming it's probably because if he didn't win then Miss America would be considered transphobic that's based that is 15 seconds of absolutely spitting facts somebody commented under this and said bro should be a linebacker for real and the person said Mr America somebody else and we need to restart as a society and then other people were coming to Brian's defense and were saying it's not the actual Miss America Pageant like you got it wrong it's a local pageant like they didn't have anything to say about the fact that a man just won a women's beauty pageant their one discrepancy was that this Creator said oh he won the Miss America Pageant rather than saying he won the local Miss America pageant in the greater Dairy area of New Hampshire like guys you're missing the whole point it is part of the Miss America organization and if he continues moving up in the ranks and going from being Miss Dairy to Miss New Hampshire then he would go on to being miss Mr America and that guy has a point Miss America will probably bend the knee because they don't want to be called transphobic if they ax a trans guy now it also made the rounds on Twitter people were hitting the nail on the head with these tweets like this person said what makes me most angry about the video of the trans person that won the girls beauty pageant isn't the man winning the pageant meant for girls but it's the girls who stood by and clapped they're complicit by encouraging such nonsense they should have walked off and I'm kind of split on this because I do absolutely agree I mean I look at those women who are just like I said clapping like sales like oh my God this is so amazing this is so Progressive this is a fantastic like like ladies you are doing this to yourself but I think putting the blame just on those young women is a bit far-fetched because society as a whole has been complicit in this it is fostered this culture to allow this to happen this man still chose to enter the pageant Miss America chose to allow him to enter the pageant they chose him to win so yes I agree I probably would have walked off I would not have wanted to be involved in that [\u00a0__\u00a0] but these girls probably also didn't want to get canceled so I don't know if that's really an excuse but I don't think they are entirely to Blind somebody else said May the ugliest maybe ugliest the most out of shape man win the Miss USA pageant incredulously this likely 300 pound man has won the Miss Dairy beauty contest for girls complete with a scholarship at least trans women are held to the same exacting beauty standards as the rest of us gals this person really hits the nail on the head and I have my own qualms with beauty pageants especially when it's like young girls doing them but we have to admit that there is so much that goes into being in a beauty pageant and then being able to win a beauty pageant I mean you have to get a coach your body has to look a certain way everybody's getting their spray tans your dieting you're training you're doing your like Talent portion you have to walk around in a bikinis you need to look a certain way sacrifices are made for years for these women who want to win Miss America who believe that that is their calling or whatever then this guy comes in and we have this culture where we have to put trans people on pedestals because they have made the ultimate sacrifice they are you know giving themselves to the world they are so brave this guy yes is probably 300 pounds has not done any of that just walked on stage with his long hair and his passive aggressive tick tocks and won the entire thing and he's standing next to all of these women who have worked their asses off early Blood Sweat and Tears to be there it's insulting that's not transphobic to say at all maybe this is just some kind of double hitter because Miss America is getting like double points on the Progressive stack because they're like oh we can get a trans woman and we can also get a body positivity woman all in one pageant and then everybody will calm down and we will get all of these woke brownie points I don't know I mean I think it also says a lot about our societal standards of beauty and what is deemed healthy by Society right now but that is just an entirely different conversation another person commented and said adults ha this is so ridiculous your children oh wow this person is a hero stop letting media and public schools program children like this homeschool and protect them both of these things are 100 voluntary it will not get better they want to sterilize your children took a turn at the end there but overall very accurate I was looking at bran Brian's Tick Tock and there were all of these comments like oh my God you are so stunning you are so brave she is stunning and brave I say stunning and brave as a joke as a meme these people genuinely believe it I mean they're putting the fire Emoji oh my God kill me with your beauty it's like giving this person an inflated sense of bravery and confidence here my friends somebody else commented and said he got to change in those changing rooms as a man he got to take the crown without conforming to the excruciating standards of physique women have to he got to take a woman's scholarship prize too the message to men is loud and clear take it all it's basically what we talk about all the time in order for women to succeed apparently you just have to be a man pretending to be a woman and then you get every single opportunity just dropped right in your lap but no this is all feminism this is equality this has to make sense that is what they want us to believe and I reject all of it because this is [\u00a0__\u00a0] you do not need to be some like far-right extremist some good conservative some traditional whatever to realize that this is not right it literally just takes maybe two brain cells

cooper something is very wrong in hollywood right now obviously that is not new but this weekend i was scrolling online and there was just chaos you guys probably know about the drama that is going around olivia wilde's new movie i mean they even brought jordan peterson into it that is going to be a topic for a later segment because i want to give it its own time but for now we just need to do a catch-up episode because i need to continue some stories that we've talked about before but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already

won the chance to zoom with me when you receive uh one of these hand-signed unique polaroids in the mail possibly some other goodies as well you can enter at dailywire.combrett i hope you do i think it'll be super fun all right so y'all remember how the winnie the pooh copyright expired earlier this year i did an episode on how these horror filmmakers decided to use the expired copyright and make a slasher winnie the pooh film that was back in maybe june i think or something like that at the time there were just some images from the film but now over the weekend the trailer has been released ign tweeted about it and said winnie the pooh blood and honey the horror movie being made because of the last copyright on the original books has gotten its first trailer my god just i just can't even take this seriously because the face on this pooh bear is just absolutely awful it was funny ben was in the studio on thursday and that was when the trailer came out and i walked in to say hi to him and he and some people on his team were all watching it and he was like brett have you seen this i was like yes it's horrifying and he was like isn't it awesome and i was like oh we have very different opinions about this he very much likes the weird horror films i do not so my uh my fake brother he will probably be talking about this as well let's watch the trailer because it is finally here we should be close now we're not going to find them we will pooh piglet eeyore we were friends for many years and they're out there christopher we need to leave now i really need to find out what's happening here okay this acting is terrible oh this place is kind of cool um did you say i was at all oh god who are they we need to go there's the flowers this would have subsided what was that oh [Music] we used to be friends why are you doing this please i would have never left us [Music] i hate that that made me actually scared and that you saw me have a genuine jump scare because that might be the worst thing i've ever seen the acting looks terrible the plot looks confusing apparently christopher robin has left the hundred acre wood but now he's getting coming back because he's getting married and he wants to show his future wife all of his old friends but now they've grown up and become vicious slasher creatures but also there's some like big boob college girls hanging out in a hot tub at the same time i don't really know how those stories are connected there's lots of blood and honey and very very horrific looking like even the sign that's a 100 acre wood with the dripping blood that's like something i would have made as a 10 year old making my first short film holy jesus what is that what the is that was that mean i hope not somebody said the fact that so many quality films get shelved while garbage like this gets funded says everything about the current state of the movie industry hard pass this is really not being funded by a huge studio obviously it is an independent very low budget and they are just writing on the coattails of this copyright expiring and they are getting a ton of press so they will probably make a good amount of money just because people want to see what this actually looks like but this commenter is correct because original character-driven meaningful films are getting thrown out for crap like this that is just going to cause a splash or hyper-politicized progressive sequels or remakes it's like where's the creativity now obviously like i said it's not a big studio production but still filmmakers let's make something new is all i'm asking i get the people will probably want to go see this because it's going to be so terrible and they want to experience it firsthand but guys why are we supporting these crappy films these crappy remakes i'm just saying there are ways that you can watch the film without financially supporting and obviously us here at the comment section we do not endorse that behavior but if you partake you are probably going to need somebody to protect you and the best people to do that is expressvpn expressvpn masks your device's unique ip addresses which makes it much more difficult for nefarious people and governments and big corporations to track your activity they also reroute your internet connection so that your internet provider cannot sell your data to big tech companies which they do every day it works on your computers it also works on your phone you can turn it on with just a click of a button it is so easy if you want to try them out go to expressvpn.com cooper to get three months free again that is expressvpn.com cooper for three months free and guys like all joking aside the big tech companies they are stalking you like slasher winnie the pooh so protect yourself get on that somebody else said winnie the pooh blood and honey looks like it might be the worst movie ever made that said i plan to pre-order tickets and be there opening night that feels like how i felt about the movie cats the live-action one i felt like i was going to be in the middle of some like trip when i went and saw that movie and i really kind of scared me a bit but i went and saw it anyway because it was so bad i had to experience it somebody else said are they supposed to be actual animals if so why do they have hands are they supposed to be people in masks and costumes if so how are they abandoned when they could just leave the plot does not make sense who are they i didn't know that winnie the pooh could just grow up also apparently eor died i saw that in the trailer that's sad eeyore just needed some love guys he didn't need to be abandoned somebody else said whoever thought this was a good idea is not seeing the pearly gates of heaven another person said what the hell is this i'm not impressed at all they're running out of good ideas i see i honestly it made me happy because even though there are people like that commenter that was like i'm gonna have to see this just because of how ridiculous it is most people and this was trending for like three days we're saying no i don't want to see horror winnie the pooh this is ridiculous and we're saying that exact thing of their running out of good ideas why aren't they doing anything new they are waking up to the reality that hollywood is slowly killing itself i mean it was slowly for many years now it feels like they are just on like a sprint to death for lack of a better phrase and part of that very fast sprint to death is marvel they are just shoving terrible feminist storylines into every movie and tv show much like dc and obviously we are talking about she-hulk it's doing terribly the cgi is awful she-hulk cries and gets angry about being cat-called and then of course logically she does this you ain't never gotta heat me up yes that is not a fan edit those are not two different videos smushed together that is an actual scene from she-hulk and yes that is megan the stallion twerking with the she-hulk just when i thought they couldn't get any stupider twitter even censored this when i clicked on this video i had to bypass the this might be sensitive content to look at she-hulk twerking wow so classy of you marvel love to see it ladies if you do not want to be sexualized and if catcalling makes you as angry as the hulk do not twerk and sexualize yourself it is that simple the hypocrisy of it is literally ridiculous because in the episode immediately prior she is telling hulk that he does not understand rage does not understand pain because she has to get cat called and people sexualize her and then you have an entire scene where she is twerking it just don't add up somebody made this meme and said i hate being cat called and then said now watch me shake this ass yes that's nice that's great but i mean all that aside like what the hell twitter was very very split on all of this but the people arguing in favor of it really had nothing of substance to say to be totally honest like somebody said nah i'm sorry if she-hulk throwing ass with megan italian doesn't bring you joy you're simply a loser i'm fine being a loser in this circumstance it does not bring me joy i'm not offended by it i'm just kind of confused and i don't want to see it there were other people that were saying well she hulk in the comments is very empowered sexually so this makes sense it's like okay great then why does she care about getting cackled again it's just all very confusing somebody summed up their responses by posting this and saying marvel fans explaining why the new she-hulk needs to twerk so you can understand the new avengers movie it's like come on guys you can still be a marvel fan and admit that this was not the greatest look so ladies do you feel represented and empowered yet no i do not not in the slightest they made like a beefy fake cgi woman crying about being a woman and then twerking and are expecting us to be happy about it i've said this before but womanhood is being reduced to some kind of caricature it is a game of dress up they are not actually interested in this character or what she has to say or her journey or of becoming the shield no they just want to give her some fake feminist tropes make her cry about being oppressed and think that we're all gonna jump and say hoorah yay thank you for representing women no it is not that simple somebody else said the shield twerking scene is horrible not because of hypocrisy or something like that because the clap of gent's cheeks didn't even cause the windows to crack let alone shake down the building i'm quite crossed he's out of line but he's right that was the most liked tweet uh it has 159 000 likes i mean that comment brings up an interesting point cause not only was it cringe but the cgi of that scene was terrible i don't want to watch it again but if you want to go back and just look it is so so weird i mean the poor vfx artists who had to do that i feel awful for them a bunch of people were tweeting about that as well somebody said the cgi animators being woken up from the marvel basement being ordered to make the she-hulk twerk with meg oh god because hell is no longer a place only accessible after death i mean listen if you are tired of that if you don't want to make any weird slasher winnie the pooh films or make you know the she-hulk twerk you are welcome to come apply and work for the daily wire we don't have twerking in our films and if so i would hope that it would be better than that our content our movies they are not contributing to the social decay of our country so at least there's that guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring

Walsh and you all know that I love Matt Walsh she is near and dear to my heart and it involves Matt Walsh and somebody that he is currently feuding with online which is one of my favorite things of all time because the man holds nothing back and it's just incredible to watch and it's just I feel like I learned so much every time he starts debating with somebody on Twitter but anyway before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already ring the notification Bell so that you never miss a comment section episode and if you are wanting more information more content more time with me you can always follow me at I'm Brett Cooper on Instagram I can't promise that I will Feud with people like Matt does but you know maybe one day I'll throw my hat in the ring if you've been on Twitter you've probably seen this Matt and Libs of tick tock are going after a person named Eli Elric Arrow I should look this up Eli Ehrlich which is the weirdest name that I have ever heard run some sort of like youth transgender Coalition calls themselves like exceptionally queer and is a PhD candidate so you've got basically the trifecta of wokeness and insufferability just saying lips of tick tock started this all four days ago and posted this said uh red flag red flag red flag and posted this screenshot from Eli's Instagram it's a picture of Eli holding up this pill and he writes there are over 20 states trying to criminalize hormone therapy particularly for Trans youth so my friends and I had an idea sending out our extra prescriptions around the country if you need hormones I'm working with a distribution Network to get you access everything is free no questions asked we have hundreds of doses of testosterone estradiol and spironolactone available right now all are prescribed by doctors and unused each package comes with information on dosage obtaining blood work etc I realize that this is only a Band-Aid solution we need full access to affirmative care from professionals immediately let me get this straight this person is saying they're going to send out prescription drugs to trans people especially young people youths who might not be able to access it whose parents don't want them to access who cannot afford it there's nothing on unprescribed medicine two children that is incredibly illegal I literally had a doctor's appointment yesterday and I went after I had spent a couple of hours researching all of this and I went into him and he follows the daily wire and I said have you seen this like are we all wrong like is this incredibly illegal and he was shocked and was going oh my God yeah this person needs to be in jail and then you look in the comments and somebody says as much as I love this we need more covert ways of reaching those in need openly announcing such things leads to States making it illegal and punishable by law first of all sending prescription drugs illegally is already illegal and punishable by law just saying Eli responds and says I completely agree this is just a Band-Aid solution to something that will have to be solved on the cultural level I hope someday we can manufacture estrogen ourselves and won't have to depend on pharmacies at all as for visibility well it's a double-edged sword without it too few would know these Resources with it I'm taking a risk granted a very minimal one being at NYC acknowledging this person is acknowledging that they are doing something illegal but thinks that they are above the law because they live in the Communist Paradise of NYC and then finishes off by saying recipients are very unlikely to face an illegal blowback because who's to say I'm not just shipping myself a prescription is this person an idiot you are posting about your illegal activity online involving drugs involving minors and saying I'm not going to face any legal blowback now this post had been up for a couple of months prior to Lips of tick tock finding it but once she posted this and posted these screenshots Eli took it down and his tweets are now also protected so you can only see them if you follow him so Eli knows what they are doing is wrong they know they are being caught but guys the fire is just now starting yes The Fire Rises especially because then Matt Walsh jumped in and really started the internet beef but of course even though I love this my favorite beef is still from good ranchers and this month I am loving them even more because they have committed to giving out 100 000 meals to children in need as they are getting ready to go back to school if you want to help them make this happen go to goodranchers.com use promo code Cooper to get 30 off of your order plus free shipping and for 10 of you who use that promo code and buy a box from good ranchers you will have the chance to come on a zoom call with me on September 29th we can cook steaks you can ask me anything it'll be a really good time and we will be helping good Rancher with their mission so again go to goodranchers.com use promo code Cooper you get 30 off free shipping and we get to hang out and we can talk about our favorite internet beef because that's literally what I live for um and Matt Walsh is giving us all of the content right now Matt Walsh then jumped in retweeted the original lives of tick tock post and said I'm gonna go after this person this is so wrong this is disgusting and criminal and he immediately started bringing it to the attention of the FBI and the DEA rightfully so because this is illegal he said submitting a tip to the DEA right now to report Eli ehrlich's confessed conspiracy to ship prescription hormonal pills to minors Nationwide and internationally even though he deleted the original post and is protecting his tweets all of that stuff Eli is still trying to spin this and act Above the Law he posted Matt Walsh's tweet and said thanks for the free advertising Matt Walsh and lives of tick tock official and tagged them on his Instagram story still trying to you know make this into some kind of marketing campaign I hope he's lawyering up that's all I'm saying Matt responded with this he said Eli is a member of a privileged class and believes that this will all blow over without consequence that's usually what happens in these situations but not this time not when you're giving dangerous drugs to kids we're not going to let it go like that's Spitting Fire and he hits the nail on the head because Eli does believe he's part of a privileged class I mean he's posting about this publicly and Matt was right he is not letting it go he and lives of tick tock dug deeper and they realize that this illegal drug operation has been going on since last year there was a post from September 2021 where Eli wrote a list of his 11 mantras that was getting him through the year and number six was redistribute your extra hormones to people who can't access and afford them I don't know if this was the first time that he was doing this but this was the first time that he has at least on record publicly said that he was shipping illegal drugs to people especially minors and while all of that was happening he she was also pushing the assassination of Supreme Court Justices lips of tiktok posted a screenshot and said Supreme Court assassination challenge because why stop with trans propaganda if you can also try to assassinate Supreme Court Justices and get every kind of woke intersectional brownie point that you can from the internet not cool not [\u00a0__\u00a0] cool you can see here this tweet has been deleted so Eli knows that he got caught seems like a trend here with this guy is that he puts all of this disgusting stuff on the internet people call him on it and he tries to backtrack it while still being Above the Law and above criticism also I know that my energy is high and I'm moving through this fast but sheller just turned to me and said this man is a psycho which is exactly how I'm feeling right now like he's a freaking creep this entire story is just wild and we can go on for hours exposing all of this stuff and talking about him but the final thing that I want to show before we dive into more of the response is that Eli admitted this whole scheme on video so he's not just posting about it he's not just you know offering he literally acknowledged it on video a few months ago I posted on Instagram asking for a testosterone for a friend who actually already had a prescription his doctor was out of town and he couldn't get a new one within hours my story was taken down and I received a warning by the administrators now of course I know it's against Instagram rules to share substances and I wasn't particularly surprised that it was removed but I was still upset so yeah I know it's illegal duh changing my Social Security to female without medical treatment so was crossing the street outside my apartment instead of using the crosswalk when it comes to Legal [\u00a0__\u00a0] be careful but don't let the law dictate your morality trans people face insurmountable mistreatment in healthcare maybe we don't want to go to a doctor maybe we don't have access to one geographically maybe we can't afford one maybe our parents don't want us to get care there are so many reasons why we should be able to offer hormones through and form consent model perhaps even not involving doctors or therapists this person is literally a creep number one they just compared giving hormones to minors setting out illegal drugs to crossing the street without a crosswalk those are in two totally different universes and secondly do not let the law dictate your morality that is just such a generalized huge cop-out for this entire conversation you could say you don't want the law to dictate your morality about literally anything that you don't like you want to murder somebody oh sorry the law doesn't dictate my morality you wanted to assassinate the Supreme Court Justices oops it doesn't really fit in with my moral compass that's not how it works it is still illegal that is how Law and Order operates just saying and then the final thing is this person literally stated that they want to remove doctors and therapists from hormone treatment what kind of Twisted world do you live in but the thing is Eli saying this is not surprising because we are living in a culture and a society that is pushing this idea that gender affirming care is something that you can just flippantly do that it is completely reversible you can just stop hormones whenever you want it has no long-term effects on you no that is an utter lie you can stop taking hormones but your body will never go back to normal that's why they call it irreversible damage you are making irreversible changes to your body to your biology that is not something that should be done outside of the medical sphere they are already trying to criminalize therapists who are not giving gender affirming talk therapy they're calling it conversion therapy now you're trying to remove doctors from prescribing medicine absolutely not that is 100 Lawless that is so dangerous especially for children but again it's unsurprising they just started to say it publicly in front of cameras so yeah I know it's illegal duh so with all of this mounting evidence Now Matt is redirecting his attention and he is trying to reach Eli's PhD program Matt tweeted out that he has reached out personally to the chancellor of UC Santa Cruz to ask her if she will investigate one of her University's PhD candidates Eli Ehrlich who has admitted to trafficking prescription drugs to minors I have not heard back yet he continued on and he said I'll give it through today but if I don't get a response from the administration then it will be my responsibility as a concerned citizen to share the published contact information for administration officials and encourage thousands of people to reach out and ask for answers the university also remains silent when Eli Elric suggested assassinating Supreme Court Justices silence is not going to be an acceptable option anymore so immediately Eli started tweeting back and posting about this and claiming that Matt Walsh was doxing him first of all it is not doxing if somebody is just sharing your contact information that is already online your professional PhD email information or the administration information for a university that literally anybody can look up in Google that's not doxing it exposing somebody's home address their family's information private things that are not online that is doxing Matt's not doing that to you so calm the hell down and to really drive the point home somebody replied to Matt here and pointed out a few other High Caliber PhD students that Eli is connected to three PhD students one campaigns to destigmatize pedophilia one masturbates to images of very young boys as part of his research and one gives drugs to children to transition them maybe phts aren't what they're all cracked up to be literally yes if we have learned anything from the past few years it is that number one these PHD programs seem to attract some weird weird creepy people who want to have their fantasies validated by Academia to put it lightly and two that these institutions are 100 corrupted by a political agenda that's the only reason why this disgusting creepy [\u00a0__\u00a0] is allowed to occur there's no other reasoning the whole thing is chaos and Matt is Right Eli is part of a protected class I mean think about what we discussed yesterday the FBI rated Trump but they didn't raid Hunter Biden they're going after Alex Jones but they're not going after fauci and White House Health officials for lying the FBI and the doj are fully political bodies well they actually go after Eli I have no idea we can hope because that would be the right and the lawful thing to do but you know maybe they need a little bit of an extra push in the right direction like maybe this criminal being accused of sexual harassment and rape you've got to be in kidding post-millennial released this a couple of days ago the headline is trans activist accused of sexual abuse boasts of plans to illegally distribute hormones to children so first of all they talk about the whole Matt Walsh lives of tick tock Saga everything that Eli is doing and then they go into these allegations which was first released by Redux magazine who uncovered numerous accusations of violent sexual abuse by Eli one of erlich's alleged victims described how she entered into an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with a trans student educational resources co-founder and executive director Eli Ehrlich when she began volunteering for the organization two posts were made in September and November of 2016 by a young woman who described how Ehrlich left her bloody after fisting her against her will another person wrote in 2016 about how air like sexually abused her and attempted to silence her through a smear campaign and then the young woman reportedly committed suicide in 2019 after receiving an outpouring of violent threats and abuse from airlik's followers that's not all another woman said that Ehrlich had a reputation in the San Francisco Bay area's queer Community for being an admitted rapist and violently sexually abusing women still more accusations have been documented these are not the only ones so this person is not only sending prescribed medicine to random people around the country including miners we have to drive home the fact that they are willing to send it to children just willy-nilly but this person is also an accused rapist multiple times over but this person is still so cocky that they are willing to post publicly about all of this stuff and still believe that they are above the law people like this who have been accused of violent crimes and are still doing illegal acts are so confident that they will never be reported they will never be de-platformed they will never be arrested that they are willing and they feel comfortable enough to post this crap online and publicize their illegal activity I've said it before but we live in a dumpster fire of a society they want us silenced well they consistently and constantly act Above the Law and then simultaneously turn around and call us the fascists if there was ever an example of gaslighting this is it hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "nwxKGIv5oDM": "[Music] welcome back to off the clock today i am doing yet another segment where i attempt to reveal things to you because you guys have burning questions and are always trying to figure out things about my life and so i'm going to find a way to answer more of these questions in an interesting way so we're going to play never have i ever i sent out a couple of posts i posted it on tik tok did a community post asking for your best never have i ever prompts let's see what you guys came up with i have not seen any of these never have i ever been to paris daughter i have not been that even though many people believe that i am never have i ever crashed a golf cart into a tree i have not my grandparents lived on a golf resort for basically my entire life up until about two years ago so i would ride golf carts around there technically i was not allowed to and my grandparents are very nervous people and so i really didn't get to do a lot of golf carting until i think i turned 15 they're like okay i guess now it's appropriate meanwhile my cousins would just steal them in the middle of the night and go golf carting i had to stick up my ass so i followed the rules so no i've never crashed into a tree never have i ever kicked a cat i have never kicked a cat i'm not a cat person per se like i will pick dogs over cats if i had to but i like cats never have i ever lost an argument to a liberal i don't think i've ever lost one because facts and logic i think that there have been a couple of times where there was just we had to agree to disagree because our values were so different i think that often comes up with the you know abortion debate you know i can try to convince you to change your values but that's like a much bigger ordeal so that's probably the only like there's been situations like that but i've never felt like i've been destroyed never have i ever been blackout drunk um no i have never blacked out actually i've never blacked out i have also never puked from alcohol only time that i feel like i got close to it was when i was on a ski trip with the ucla snowboarding team and i'm very very bad at drinking games and so i lost a whole bunch of them and i had to do a bunch of dares and then it was actually new year so then everybody was popping champagne but i held my own and i credit that to my strong family that almost exclusively drinks tequila because we really like margaritas my brother will basically drink an entire bottle of jack and will not feel a thing so try to let that flow through my veins never have i ever snuck out as a teenager i never did that no i once when my mom still had my location on her phone i once turned it off because i said i was going to be at one location and then i moved to a secondary location never do that people and i didn't want her to know so i turned it off did not know that it would send a notification being like brett stop sharing her location with you so i got locked out of the house had to knock at her window and be like please let me come in but my brothers did sneak out they also got locked out of the house that was diane's way of handling it she would not should be like i'm too tired for this like you sleep outside never have i ever paid off all my student loan debt i am very grateful i graduated debt-free a combination of going to community college for two years prior to going to a university saved so much money it's interesting in california there's no stigma around doing the community college route there's so many transfer students who go into like uc santa barbara ucla i think it's like 40 of ucla students are actually local transfers from you know california schools they go to community colleges then they go to the ucs i did that for a number of reasons and then i had in-state tuition so very very grateful i almost went to an ivy league though and it was literally the price tag because i was gonna have to like scrounge for scholarships and loans and was not worth it for me never have i ever accidentally set a kid's shirt on fire with a sparkler my brothers have an answer for you why is it when something happens it is always you three i have been the butt of that situation but no my brothers did that to me fourth of july when i was probably two i think when we still lived on orcas island in my little baby swing i was strapped into a swing when it happened that's even worse i was locked into a thing as i was sent on fire it was a ruffled shirt to be clear so it was more flammable never have i ever dyed my hair i have never dyed my hair i'm scared too i'm absolutely petrified i don't think i will i my mom won grace super early by the time she was 30 she had like a full streak down her hair i'm already finding gray hairs i found three sticking up out of the front of my temple the other day it's just gonna happen it had my dad turned gray early i'm not gonna die it's just gonna happen i'm gonna have silver hair i'm gonna be a silver fox so no i'm not doing it never have i ever pretended to be sick to get out of something oh i definitely have covid oh yeah coven was the greatest way to get out of social situations i love canceling plans yeah definitely might have come in contact with somebody i didn't even care about covet but i used it as an excuse never i've ever turned down a marine recruit to the marine fall dance i have i'm sorry i think i've gotten invited to basically every branch of the military's dance at this point and i appreciate every invitation and my mom probably wants me to accept one of them because like i said i never went to a prom and she was always very disappointed i went to a couple homecoming dances homecoming games i did a few of the traditional high school things and i hated all of them i was like this is ridiculous i'm wasting my time like i'm telling you stick up my ass that was no fun never have i ever lied to someone because it was easier than telling the truth i mean i literally just said that i pretended that i was sick to get out of cancelling plans i do think that i have a good amount of integrity but when it comes to like white lies like that especially if it's getting out of social situation i have gotten a lot better though about being honest and just saying like listen i love you you're a wonderful person i cannot hang out tonight because my social battery is literally depleted so i think i'm getting better at that and i think that we all could use a little more honesty in that regard rather than skirting around cancelling plans so i'm better at that but i definitely have i think if we're being honest never have i ever clogged the toilet and friend's house i actually don't think so i feel like we all have clogged toilet at some point in our lives i don't think i ever have at a friend's house i feel like that would stick with me maybe if i have i've shoved it out of my brain because it was a traumatic memory i see all these videos on tick tocks of girls in the bathroom being like i'm in a boy's house for the first time and i clogged the toilet and it's overflowing what do i do like i would probably die i would just like i would that's what i would sneak out of the house i would sneak out of the house and never return never have i ever been so drunk i woke up at the wrong house absolutely not the thing with like being in college especially being in you know the sorority frat world just people were so irresponsible and i get it you're young you want to have fun but especially for girls getting so black out that you end up at the wrong place with half of your clothes on it's stupid so be more responsible you can have fun while still taking care of yourself so no thank god i have never done that i was always the person dragging the drunk  home what is the the dabs the drunk ass yeah that was my role in the sorority was being like we're getting in the uber and you're going home because that's what heroes do one time this girl literally stripped on naked and was sprinting around the sorority house at 2 am because i and she was yelling and she was so upset because i told her she couldn't stay at the frat house and i was like well sorry that i'm a buzzkill never have i ever tp at a house nobody always wanted to is that bad i would see it in movies and be like oh that looks like a fun time never have i ever pooped my pants as an adult what no i have not literally why is this such a big issue for people do we all need to it's because of hormones and our diets i'm telling you it's the freaking seed oils that's why all of you have bowel problems probably also hormonal birth control you know their studies about that messes up women's everything never have i ever gone on a blind date i have actually one of the best dates i ever went on he's a friend of mine now and we it was like the second date in and we were like oh god this is never gonna work but uh had a mutual friend he set us up and we went to a gun range i'd never met this guy before he was like ex-military and our friend was super lib and knew that both of us were not and he was like you two like guns you should go on a date until we went to the gun range and then we were not compatible literally whatsoever but it was a very very fun blind date probably not the safest idea to go to a gun range on a blind date but you know what it's fine it was great never have i ever been to the kentucky derby i have never been to the kentucky derby if i did i would probably cry you have seen my horse videos i would like to go can we plan that for next year i'm gonna wear a big ass hat never have i ever wrecked my car i mean i've hit some things but i've never wrecked my car i got into one accident back in l.a where i was hit by a 16 year old kid in his parents huge white mercedes he was a a 16 year old armenian kid and i was i was in glendale california i didn't do anything about it because i was afraid that the armenian mafia was gonna come for me five minutes after the accident 15 of his family members showed up it was just me and i kid you not 15. i was like okay this guy's connected you know whatever i don't care i'll pay for myself milo kia was like banged up and his mercedes was barely hit at all and i was like oh it's fine it's it's fine let me go home i've run over a few curbs i wouldn't you know in parking in those tight little la parking garages i might have scraped a pole but i'm a woman what can i say never have i ever gotten into somebody else's car by accident no i have not never have i ever left the country i have left the country first place i ever went was ethiopia i've been to cuba france england austria czech republic hungary slovakia for like an hour because you can hop over never have i ever punched a girl in the nose with a smiley face oh yeah great no i've never when i was doing martial arts still i broke a nose it was not actually you know i was not in a real fight fight but my trainer's face guard shifted and i went then blood everywhere it was one of the most horrible days of my life probably worse for him but i was so i felt so bad i was crying he was not crying he was like oh it's fine i was like i'm so sorry i did this to you but no i've never punched a girl never have i ever been skydiving i have been skydiving i did it twice in one day because i loved it so much tempting death never have i ever had a bird poop on my head i literally had that happen like a month into working at daily wire i was filming something for my instagram story and one went right there i hate birds they're so useless we work in treacherous country out here in the south never have i ever accidentally sent a text to a person that it wasn't supposed to go to i have but it's never been bad like it's never been talking about the person or anything that was exceptionally revealing it was just i was i would accidentally do it never have i ever impulsively ate an entire container of ice cream i'm a woman i obviously have not even a question never have i ever had my pants dropped in indian restaurants you guys know me too well now yeah i have you guys know that never have i ever stolen one of michael nols's cigars out of his office no not a thief also he doesn't have as many cigars as jeremy boring does that's the truth i do have two cigars from matt walsh's birthday that say sweet baby gang on them that i have not used but i took two of them which means that the next off the clock video should just be me hanging out in a cigar bar me and all my old old men friends i've actually never been to one but i think i would feel ill i don't do well with smoke i don't that was actually fun those are funny before you go make sure that

content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and i don't want you to miss a thing", "Hr3IPcLlVng": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper so big news in Hollywood and in the world for anybody who cares which might be a lot of you might be none of you but I'm going to talk about it anyway Leonardo DiCaprio is single again oh my gosh which really surprises no one to be honest because as you probably know by now because he is 44 years old and has been in Hollywood since he was like six Leonardo DiCaprio is a bit of a serial dater and we're going to get into that in a moment but before we talk about it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and make sure to go check out my merch collection at dailywire.com Brett and of course ring that notification Bell so that you never miss a comment section episode because now that Leonardo DiCaprio is single I might have more updates for you but anyway all right so Newark post first broke the story and they said Leonardo Dicaprio and Camila Marone break up after four years but people immediately started pointing out something about this story and that's Camilla's age she just turned 25. you can Google her here Camilla here's her age 25 she turned 25 on June 16th and while that honestly shouldn't carry much weight it does for Leo because Leo even though he is 44 years old he exclusively dates women who are under the age of 25. things that make you go hmm there is literally a graph that a Reddit user made a couple of years ago to demonstrate this so let's just take a peek Leonardo DiCaprio refuses to date a woman over 25 so we have uh the orange line is Leo's age and then we have Leo's girlfriend's age so he is on just the steady you know he's getting older like we all are but look at all of his girlfriends it's science science this is the kind of science that I like listen guys I only failed one exam in my entire life and it was my statistics midterm freshman year of college but if this had been the things that we were looking at I would have gotten an A plus in that class I'm just saying I mean literally this trend in his dating is now so well known that even his colleagues make fun of him for it just watch this once upon a time in Hollywood nearly three hours long Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere and by the end his date was too old for him so [Applause] you know you're nearly 50 son he's not even trying to hide it at all he turned to his friends like him not wrong but his colleague is probably don't roast him as much as the internet does at least not publicly Because the Internet is just such a special place like somebody said maybe Leonardo DiCaprio hated 911 so much that he can't date women who remember it did that ever occur to you oh that's tough somebody else said the girl Leonardo DiCaprio will dump when he's 72 was born today oh that's also horrific like when is he gonna stop I'm not [\u00a0__\u00a0] leaving is he ever gonna settle down is this gonna be until he's 80 years old is he gonna be like some new Hugh Hefner new Playboy bunny-esque this girl said maybe Leonardo DiCaprio feels bad for all the women who can't rent a car until they're 25 and is actually a really good guy did that ever occur to you this is honestly my new favorite like tweet format just side note it is absolutely idiotic that you can't rent a car until you're 25. I've said this before I want the legal age for adulthood to be one thing across the board I don't care if I can't drink until I'm 21 but then I can I can join the military when I'm 18 but I can't rent a car it's like it's so confusing it's ridiculous so maybe Leo's just trying to lend these girls to Helping Hand yeah okay like you can't rent a car I'll drive you around in my Lambo don't worry no this is gross so what he said in two years when variety announces that Leonardo Dicaprio and Olivia Rodrigo started dating it's gonna be a [\u00a0__\u00a0] rough day the thing is guys Olivia who is probably around my no she's a little younger than me when she had just turned 18. she was dating a guy who was 30. maybe like some music producer like she had a bit of a moment and then they broke up but anyway so she's already kind of on that Trend so that could be quite plausible another person said maybe he's very considerate of their biological clock and doesn't want to waste their time if he has no intention to commit yeah I don't think this man has ever thought about commitment in his entire life the only person he's ever semi-committed to is Kate Winslet and they're just best friends and it breaks my heart every time I realize that they're not together but also he seems like he could be a piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'll never let go I promise she's an angel so I'm glad that they're friends but the fact that they aren't together is still horrific in my eyes uh another person said or maybe women over the age of 25 refuse to date Leo and then somebody replied and said no woman over 25 would refuse to date anyone uh which is tough um but it's I was thinking about it and I was trying to figure out some rationality to all of this when I thought of this so Leo is like a huge climate guy he is basically the Greta thundberg this is all wrong of Hollywood so maybe this is all somehow connected to that like the world is ending and the oceans are rising so we want to date as many like young chicks as possible before we all combust or like I don't know but Leo if you are that worried about the planet and the growing population and the stress that is putting on our planet maybe date some women that are not fertile so you don't have to worry about repopulating with them I'm sure there are many post-menopausal women who would love to have you it would be worth a shot is all I'm

"R9NApyDK1hM": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome back to another episode of off the clock um i have popcorn and i am clearly not in my studio and i am surrounded by movie posters which can only mean one thing i am in sheller's house today today is the day that you all have been waiting for you all been asking for i am finally going to start watching star wars so as video evidence that i actually did this i have cameras on me i'm going to be watching what movie is this this is the original star wars number one well episode four but yes number one the okay the original original okay watching episode four first star wars i think i saw this maybe when i was eight years old i have not seen it since i don't remember anything about it i like to pretend that maybe i know a little something about it because i see pictures of luke and leia okay han solo i know who java the hutt is so what do you remember exactly um they are in a in a galaxy far far away they are okay and there's um robots and there is like the rebel forces and then there's are they the good guys are the bad guys rebels are the good guys okay then there's the bad guys and they're like fighting for the galaxy luke is like this kid and then leia is the daughter of somebody um darth vader is involved in some regard i know there's a lot of scenes in the desert and you see big like tank kind of things and robots rolling over okay yeah all right um leia has the buns i but i don't remember the plot the only thing that i remember is that there's like two forces fighting against each other okay that's probably all i need to know so those are the only details that you remember and know about star wars literally nothing else i mean i would like see yoda i know yoda's in it okay i don't know when or where he shows up well spoiler he's not in this one okay well that's the only reason i'm here sorry well i mean if you know if this video does well if you guys like it then we can do the next one that's really what sheller's been talking about this entire time bobby is here as well and they're just like we really want people to watch this video so that you can watch the second film because apparently that one's better yeah we want to watch the second one so we got to hype this video up i'm going to learn so much about star wars um oh r2d2 he is in this film is that little one or big one he's the little one okay cool so i know something that's what i'm gonna beat for halloween maybe i can repurpose my corn costume okay anyway i'm ready to go we're gonna start the film i have my pumpkin spice cold brew here because i'm a basic [\u00a0__\u00a0] we have our popcorn we have popcorn i do not have a pumpkin spice latte well you're not basic no i do know this [Music] those are funny hats [Music] it looks familiar looks like everyone's dead we seem to be made to suffer he's just like a whiny gay british dude oh that's sad but i was going into toshi station to pick up some power converters whiny ass luke skywalker all right come on disgusting creatures [Laughter] do you think the disgusting creatures lying would be culturally insensitive now they'll probably yes i bet you have boom in the first alteration of this movie george lucas was like yeah i don't like how han solo always shot first it makes him look like a bad guy so they did this stuff where it made greedo look like he shot first and then they sort of shifted harrison ford over and then he then he shoots in defense okay but it takes away from how much the badass so that's where the meme han shot first comes from those suits do nothing if they're all getting shot what's the point chewie's like a a big crusty white dog okay she's not insinuating the rocky little child i mean she actually kind of does she looks like she has rabies or she's high [Music] that's all i care about hell yeah hell yes that was good so what'd you think okay well there was so much in that that made sense not like there are so many references that were in that film that i didn't realize were star wars right like the uh hey kid don't get too cocky yeah um i got a bad feeling about this yes all those um even just memes with like r2d2 and cp3o c g3pl c3po yep i knew that all those things i just had no contacts for i was not driving with it at the beginning didn't i did not dislike it it was just slow that's the part of the film that i remembered all of the glendale-esque la landscapes the desert it was very slow once they actually started fighting that was good i totally forgot that obi-wan like died did all that stuff that was totally i don't it was very good though yeah it's like uh the old-fashioned heroes journey yes done executed perfectly and the i don't say animation but the special effects yes special effects it feels like it was ahead of its time it was because even watching it now it seemed high caliber in a way it didn't seem like it was poor quality it just seemed kind of stylistic now but maybe that's just because star wars has left such an impact but it's like that kind of thing like even the foggy kind of shots that sort of thing it was very stylized so watching it i would think like oh okay this is something that might have been produced these days but it was just an ace you know yes type of genre yeah there were like some techniques that were developed for the movie 2001 but this movie sort of took those and really ran with it and did things that no one had ever done before and uh so when people saw this in 1977 they were just like you know it blew them away just how how uh cool the special effects were but of course a little dated well i still i mean it still didn't seem dated to me in a way yeah like once you get into it at the beginning it definitely did but once you're into the plot yeah in the narrative and you're just really following it then you can't really tell um i do think that luke skywalker is a bit of a beta [\u00a0__\u00a0] he's kind of he's kind of a little [\u00a0__\u00a0] i hope it's a meme i hope that in the next films he toughens up a bit um yeah so the next one is the next one like the pasting like this one's out of all of them this one has like the most dated pacing okay um that might be sac religious to say but um yes i'm with you like the stuff in the desert um when luke i mean uh c-3po and r2d2 are sort of like together on the desert before the jaw was that seems like my least favorite part of probably the whole original trilogy it sets it up nicely but it's kind of treacherous yes if one were to nitpick that would be like my nitpick yeah but in the second one the pacing is just it's like razor sharp and it that one feels like a modern movie in terms of the way it moves it felt like the first half of this was almost like a portrait of a galaxy in a land that we don't really know and then the sec the latter half was an action film yeah but they felt like two totally different things which wasn't bad it was just you kind of had to wait to get into it yeah um i think it's idiotic that they tried to go back in later and make han solo like not shoot first and do all of that stuff because his whole character is that he just doesn't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah exactly and then he has his like redemptive thing at the end yeah but if you're making him just be like i say like oh i do no harm no i mean i told you about that but if you actually watch it it just the execution looks so bad okay and so pathetic it's like why did they even do that don't get me started but um that's why you have the og version that's why i have the og version so untouched so i never have to see that [\u00a0__\u00a0] ever again who were your favorite characters han solo and the droids yeah leia bothers me really yes you didn't like that she's uh i mean she sort of is the damsel in description but at the same time she's like spunky she doesn't put up i guess so but it there's something about her i liked that scene where she was being rescued and i thought that was like her best moment i think that her character has to work off of like the luke and han solo energy which is with everybody else it just felt very flat and like a basic heroic like i'm not going to give up my family whatever not that that's a bad thing it was just kind of like that's a trope that's been done before it didn't feel that special she felt very flat but when put into the trio the gang per se she seemed a lot more exciting but maybe that's you know sacrilegious to use the word that you just used to say that i didn't love princess leia but not necessarily i just liked the other i think it wasn't the other characters from a comedic yeah uh maybe it's like sort of like her faux british accent that she tries to do some of the time that she drops it yeah she felt more natural in like the friendship re like that world where she was playing off of those other characters when it was just her and like darth and the leaders all that kind of thing it was like she was so stiff and almost like her character was playing a character in a way which i thought was a bit ridiculous okay uh and then luke he's just he whines too much yeah he's pretty beta yeah like his well eve all of his reactions when like anything bad would happen even when his aunt and uncle died it was just like this was his normal thing he does this and then something else would happen you go oh okay i'm like give me something else now a lot of like if you were to talk to the actors if you hear them in like interviews yeah and whatnot they always recount what it was like working with george lucas and apparently he wasn't good with working with actors well that yeah in fact he's got a record saying that he hates working with actors and so like he's in the wrong industry they would be like they'd be like george what do you want with this and he's like well that's good and he'd just say like louder more sad i mean we've talked about this before where there are actors that show up on set that really really need a director that kind of show up as basically gumby and they need the director to be really really good at both acting and directing and communicating with actors and it really is a skill to be able to manage the whole production and then to like cultivate performances because there are you know if you're doing a new genre if it's this kind of film or if you are a young actor you kind of need to be molded in a way but if you have you know luke's character that is kind of and then george lucas who doesn't want to it's just like not really giving them anything then i guess that would make more sense yeah see i feel like harrison ford is probably one of those actors that are like that that just show up and go where do i understand okay and he's got it you know what i mean and that's like why he's that's why he's he's good he just didn't he looks like he didn't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's what i'm saying he's just like something that i really like in actors like if i think that an actor is good is when they're throwing away lines and if you see somebody who's trying too hard where it's like i'm in the moment i'm feeling things i'm like give me a break like maybe that is a character choice but for the most part you can tell when somebody's like i'm really going to be in it where i always think it's much more powerful to just you know oh i don't really care i'm throwing it away because in our day-to-day life 99 of the time we're not thinking you know about oh i need to have this emphasis when i talk and so i think harrison ford kind of has that attitude throughout the entire film and that probably was who he was you know showing up i don't really care his character is also like that so i think he is more relatable but uh yeah that star wars um i really do want you to watch the second one though that is the best one okay well if you want to watch me watch the second one uh comment on this like it we will make it happen and i will make the treacherous journey back out to sheller's house and i will watch is that episode five uh yes two number two episode five yes the second one episode five what are these called the big three the original trilogy the ot okay that's what it was the big three uh i will watch number five or number two whichever universe you're living in i will

but like I really want to I almost walked out today and I'm crying in the back room right now and I almost caught on the floor and then people are yelling at me because I don't have their orders ready well to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper today we are going to talk about Starbucks I think you guys know if you watched the pumpkin spice latte video with Michael Knowles I do like Starbucks but I really only go during the fall to get the pumpkin cold foam I'm not really a Starbucks goer I'm not a frequenter what am I saying I really don't go to Starbucks that often there's so many great coffee shops in Nashville that I go to instead it's just kind of has fallen off my radar since leaving La but anyway today we are going to talk about their employees before I get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com to check out my merch collection things are already shipping out a lot of stuff is almost sold out so if you've not gotten anything now it's time to do it if you don't already know for the past couple of years Starbucks has been in a bit of a war the employees want to unionize Starbucks does not want them to there have been many revolts walkouts negotiations all over the country they've turned it into this whole like leftist propaganda machine it's kind of insane but no real progress has been made for the cause the fight is escalated now and many groups are even suing Starbucks for exploiting labor and alleged union busting it's a whole thing Starbucks even posts about it on their social media and they get slammed for it conservatives have called for a ban because of Starbucks support for abortion some of the trans issues in previous years leftists are now calling for boycotts due to this the pita people are calling for boycotts because Starbucks increases costs for vegan milk so really it seems like everybody kind of hates Starbucks except me during the months of September and October but do I think the people are going to stop buying their mediocre overpriced coffee from Starbucks anytime soon no probably not that's just the world we live in but I did see a video last night that kind of briefly touches on the union stuff while also making me hate my generation and I just wanted to share it with you guys because it was just wild people wonder why we need a union at Starbucks and I I'm literally about to quit like I I don't know if I'm gonna do it but like I really want to I almost walked out today and I'm crying in the background right now and I almost caught on the floor like it gets I'm like a full-time student I get scheduled for 25 hours a week and then on weekends they schedule me the entire day open to close up on the schedule for eight and a half hours both Saturday and Sunday I'm like three and a half hours into my shift there's so many customers and we have four people on the floor all day only five people were put on the schedule and somebody had to call out and there are four people although like sounds behind this are crazy at least we don't have Fair scheduling managers don't care about us our manager was supposed to come in this weekend and he took himself off the schedule so he wouldn't be able to be held accountable for calling out he just literally poured on the schedule that he was scheduled on and put up a new schedule where he wasn't on the schedule also he couldn't have even seen that he was scheduled in the first place because he didn't want to be held accountable for not wanting to commit we need a union because this can't happen this can't happen we need Fair scheduling we need managers to hold themselves accountable for helping their workers they refuse to turn mobile orders off we need the Liberty to be able to do that because there's so many mobile orders and I need to get through all of them and then people are yelling at me because I don't have their orders ready because I don't know what to do and a customer was misgendering me today like really badly I didn't have their order ready wow what a waste the poor children she's clearly incompetent I have a full mustache and beard I don't get accommodations for being neurodivergent I don't I can't like people get out of me it's in my sick time I don't even know what to do anymore I only got my wits up with this job okay you know what happens when you don't like a job and you feel like you're being exploited or whatever you can quit can't be that easy it's that easy and everything that this person I think it's a male a female to male Evan their name is Evan everything that Evan is saying is just normal things that you go through in the service industry some days you have great days some days the customers are awful to you and you know what that's what you signed up for it's fine I wish people were more polite but you know what that's kind of the world we live in and you know what sometimes people call out sometimes your managers don't show up sometimes you have a sucky manager that's literally just life that is the job you chose to have that is not reason to unionize because you're not getting Fair scheduling we have a worker shortage in this country there's going to be no fair scheduling these days this is just the world that we live in I'm so sorry that this is happening to you that the bankrupt economy and labor shortage and lazy generation is happening to you at least you are trying to work I will give you credit for that you're not just sitting on unemployment because you're a neurodivergent or whatever I appreciate but you are trying to go and work but this is just kind of life so buckle up buddy because it's going to get a lot worse I'm just saying watch much Matt Walsh tweeted about it and somebody replied to him and said he's the reason that unionizing for Starbucks is going to be bad just full of weak pansies who don't want to do any work this is just pathetic yes somebody else said the kids these days think that eight hours is doing a double shift yeah that was really weird when he was like open to close eight and a half hours that would actually be like 12 hours Starbucks is open from like 6 a.m to 8 P.M 9 p.m in some places I don't think you're working that entire time somebody else said we have raised a generation of adult five-year-olds emasculated them in advertising culture film education and gender bending Etc by 18 I was coat hangering turds from toilets at work and gutting deer I definitely was not doing that but throughout high school and college I was cleaning up bathrooms at Trader Joe's so we've all done our time basically somebody else said wait till he sees all the taxes and deductions taken from his paycheck yet that'll be a rude awakening you're having to work those god-awful eight and a half hours and you're basically just getting paid for five of them somebody else said the spanking generation turned out much better than the timeout generation I'm just gonna say it oh I'm sure that got people angry another person said he's allowed to be frustrated at Starbucks and his crappy manager not pulling their weight people keep bringing up his eight hour shift so working a job on top of being a full-time student would be tiring he's having a vent so what let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin Yes actually being a full-time student and working a job is tiring and that has been what normal people have done for years until gen Z because gen Z is a generation starting in the workforce later than any other generation before them their College jobs are their immediate post-grad jobs are their first jobs that they have ever worked they never babysat they'd ever mowed lawns they never had a bagging job at the grocery store in high school they are unaccustomed to this kind of responsibility and time management that has to be done if you are going to be a student and working a job which again until very recently was a very normal thing for people to do and to this person's point about him just having events session yes everybody is allowed to vent we all vent about our jobs the issue is that he is publicly posting his vent session and making it everybody else's problem rather than his own because he's blaming the institution of Starbucks demanding that they unionize at a place where he chooses to work he's blaming a society that is misgendering him and having too many customers the paper's Revolution but I have had plenty of crappy managers and supervisors when I worked these College jobs I worked at Trader Joe's when I was a waitress whatever you want to call it I sure as hell vented but I did not blame the restaurant industry or Trader Joe's as a company compose yourself figure it out and if it is actually that bad you do not have to work there people are hiring everywhere get a different job if it is so awful this is serious I know this really is the world's smallest violin see these comments that I saw were actually a bit harsh but they were kind of spot on and they made me laugh somebody said all of the Starbucks unionizing culture is so funny to me like if you're fat gay and have a liberal arts degree just say that that's true though it is somebody else said obviously I support workers rights but I think the idea of staying at Starbucks long enough to give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about unionizing is really funny like literally this nobody is forcing you to work there hundreds of other coffee shops would be happy to have a barista where you can work if that is your thing if you want to stay in that industry or if you need a different part-time job with flexibility and you're a happy puppy person go to Trader Joe's I will die on the Trader Joe's Hill you do not have to be in this predicament where you are crying online about your job you are turning yourself into a victim go find a different job go find a job that will make you happier where you feel like you are supported if you really really need it and if it really isn't that bad then suck it up and deal with it because that's life thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this channel turn on your notifications like this video and of course if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper see you next time", "DjLb3axNLx4": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I have some NFL news for you guys today we're not talking sports but we're doing something that is sports adjacent because guys apparently according to page six Tom Brady and Gisele I'm not even going to attempt to pronounce her last name are calling it quits but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection okay so page six originally broke the story and then every Outlet like New York Post even daily wire was commenting on it so here is the New York post Tweet about it they said exclusive Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen I think that's right uh hire divorce lawyers sources say and then they have the classic rip down the middle of their picture now apparently their marriage has been on the rocks for a little bit and this you know really started when Tom Brady announced that he was retiring and then literally a month later decided never mind I want to play again and Giselle expressed that she was disappointed in that decision with him coming back to play but at the time she said that she was supporting him nonetheless this is her quote she said obviously I have my concerns this is a very violent Sport and I have my children and I would like him to be more present I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again but ultimately I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for them he needs to follow his Joy too now to be honest that does not sound like wholehearted support to me and you know what I'd probably be pissed too if he told the world and our family that he was retiring to spend more time with us he was you know hanging up the football helmet and then he literally turned around four weeks later and said never mind peace out deuces and went back and played some more ball but also like I get people love him I don't even follow football that much and I know that he is the goat he proves that you can keep fighting doing what you love and that in many circumstances age is in fact just a number and fans adore him because number one he's based number two because he is empowering and he is such an inspiration however ever if you are losing your family over that it might be a good time to make a change somebody said Tom after last season I need to spend more time at home with my wife and kids I've missed them growing up their soccer games and my wife hasn't had a husband which is what he said when he retired and then Tom one month later I'm back F those kids my wife will be fine and then Giselle said here's another ring for you champ when like that all happened last year but now they were thrust back into the Limelight during the NFL preseason when Brady left training camp for two weeks to deal with family issues and then apparently there was this whole thing where they were on vacation and Giselle said no I don't want to be here and took the kids and flew to some other tropical island and then he went back to training like a whole thing it's been very public but obviously we don't really know the details and the internet is pretty split on this and a lot of people are blaming Giselle and saying that she's just trying to take his money and ruin his career but like y'all number one let's not do that number two her net worth is almost double his because if you forget prior to them getting married she was like the number one runway model before she stopped modeling to take care of her kids she has enough money she's going to be fine so let's just enjoy some tweets because they are hysterical and this has been trending for the last couple of days but this guy said Brady and Gisele divorcing is like the Queen's death but for 53 year old men from Boston siraj said Giselle when Tom Brady says he's playing another season this is not a sport this is Satanism somebody else said Giselle about to be the biggest free agent to hit the market in years yeah there's already a bunch of tweets of people speculating like which young hot NFL player she'll hook up with or go to but uh my personal favorites are now the Pete Davidson memes because you all know I love making fun of Pete Davidson somebody said Pete Davidson finding out about the Brady Gisele divorce rumors I mean here's a conspiracy theory maybe while Pete Davidson was still dating Kim Kardashian he learned that you know Tom Brady Giselle kind of on the fritz and he was like bye Kim I got a new hot older woman to go date because he exclusively apparently dates women that potentially could be his mother what not really but there are at least like 12 years older than him this guy said giselle's final plea to Tom Brady and it says stop playing football you know what I'm gonna play football even harder and speaking of conspiracy theories actually some people on the internet especially Tick Tock believe that Giselle has been the force behind all of Brady's wins and I don't mean Force like the force but sort of in a way and that them getting divorced is going to end his streak he's not going to be the goat anymore because Gisele will not be there pushing him forward and in my opinion y'all if his streak ends it's probably just because he is 45 freaking years old however this is actually a big conspiracy theory that I did not know about and people are tweeting about it this guy said my girlfriend said that witches on Tick Tock said that Giselle is a witch in a cool way and supported Tom with her witch powers that made him good in his early 40s and then when she asked him to step back for the family he said no so now that she is not supporting him he is going to be washed another person said no I don't care about football but I am absolutely obsessed with the conspiracy theory that Gisele bunjin is a witch and has been responsible for all of Tom Brady's success and is now ruining his career with her witch powers a huge moment for women hashtag girl boss girl bossing way too close to the Sun yay feminism I guess but apparently Tom Brady has leaned into this this is not just Tick Tock witches look at this video this actually kind of shocked me in a way any superstitions going into the game any special thing you carried into the game on Sunday that you had ducked away somewhere uh I did I always um you know I've learned a lot from my wife over the years she's so about the power of intention you know and believing things that are really going to happen and she always makes a little altar for me at the game because she she just wills it so much and uh so she put together a little altar for me that I could bring with pictures of my kids and I had these little special stones and healing stones and protection stones that she has me wear a necklace and drop she makes I say all these mantras and I stopped questioning her a long time ago I did I just shut up and listen and at first I was like this is kind of crazy and then about four years ago we were playing the Seahawks and she said you better listen to me this is your year but this is all the things you're gonna have to do to win and I did all those things and by God you don't work it was pretty good and then in 2015 it was about early January and she said you know how much I love you and I said yeah and she said I just want to let you know this is not going to be your year and of course we lost I said what does 16 look like and she said 16 is going to be your year so it was early January this year and I said babe I asking like do we have a chance and she said yeah but you're gonna have to do a lot of work and you're really gonna have to listen to me so man I listen to her and right after the game she said see I did a lot of work you do your work I do mine she said you're lucky you married a witch I'm Just a Good Witch she apparently admitted it like who knew that Tom Brady was walking around with crystals in his back pocket with healing necklaces on I didn't but you know what the man has had a legendary career and a lot of people have said I don't understand how this could have happened how he's still playing at 45 this is like a miracle this is crazy well guys now you know apparently his wife is a Flippin witch but according to Twitter there are doubters of course and he apparently played fine on Sunday obviously I have to rely on Twitter for that information because I was at a pumpkin patch and I did not watch a single second of football but either way we are watching the demise of yet another celebrity power couple I actually think this is maybe the fourth episode I've done about this in the last month the something is in the air it's October maybe the witches are out ending marriages I have no idea but either way it's kind of weird hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "OPBnfR7Q1Wc": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper i am so excited because we have a very special guest on the show today and we are going to talk about one of my very very favorite subjects uh but first of all i need to introduce the woman who needs no introduction candace owens [Applause] i'm here i'm in the comment section yes you are you are always in the comment section i am indeed actually sometimes i respond to comments and people don't think it's me mm-hmm i kind of like to do that i kind of go incognito in the comments i'm like it's me and i'm like no it's not like it's actually me that was before i started working here i mean that was something because i always knew who you were i followed you and that was one thing that i loved about you was that you were actually engaged with your fans with your community and you would get into these you know debates that you're so famous for in these feuds but it was because you were actually you know boots on the ground engaged in a culture war that so many people are afraid to get into yeah i mean definitely i feel like in the comments people just never expect you to clap back and i also think that because in the past conservatives have been so polite and just take it that i really surprise people like they'll like make a comment about me on instagram about like the way i look and then i'll go to their profile and take a like are you kidding me look at this unmatching outfit that you're wearing i'm not hearing this from you and they're like so like oh my gosh i can't believe she got down and dirty in the comments i'm like yeah i'm here for that all day it's bold well then you're perfect for the comment section so i'm so happy to have you here um we i've kind of teased to you what we're going to be talking about today but we all know lizzo and before we started rolling candace and i were talking about how it sucks that lizzo is so annoying yeah because she's she's talented yeah i find her songs to be catchy i like to when i work out i love alizzo so i'm going to get you all fired up and then she makes the mistake of speaking about topics of which she knows nothing about opening her mouth without music behind it and then this weird like when she apologized for losing weight i'm like what are you what are you talking about i mean lizzo if you love lizzo you shouldn't want lizzo to die and she's going to die because the number one killer in america is obesity so i don't care how you feel about your obesity you're gonna die of heart disease i mean that's just she's she's very obese yes she is and she is making herself uh even larger with this new uh campaign that she's doing um with instacart so instacart obviously is the grocery delivery app i have used it before i used to hate on instacart because i thought like why are we going into this technological age where you can't do anything yourself people are you know sending people out um and then you know you get busy and you're like well i want dinner when i get home so i'm gonna have it sent to me because i'm still filming so i have used it i have to be honest about it but instagram has a new campaign and they are using celebrities to sell their grocery lists to get people excited like oh you can buy lizzo's food so they did an ad and this ad uh debuted at the opening night of the new nfl season and so it was at halftime and uh this is what played what am i gonna get oh cherries i'm impressed that she has a fruit i know okay how about cherry ice cream with sprinkles and maybe i'll forget and i gotta get flowers for mommy and a little something for me can i get a roll like it's the embodiment of gluttony over indulgence yeah that's it and this is exactly why they picked her for their campaign because she has become this symbol for over-indulgence over consumption just you know i love food i love being fat i love to be fat in front of my private plane and half naked and if you don't like it it's because you're problematic and not me and it's like lizzo your fans hate you you know they obviously are advocating for you to die you just can't see it because they're cheering you on as you kill yourself and that's what i honestly think of lizzo it's like your music's great but also your fans want you to die because they are you know enabling and encouraging this and so many people are like you can't say one critical thing about her like her fan base is insane because even if you you know slightly you know move from the narrative they are ridiculous and it's like you are like you said they act like they are you know lifting her up and supporting her but inevitably she's going to crash and burn well accurately said is that her fan base is insane right and so i mean i've dragged lizzo for other things because she's so not educated and she was saying for people to you know um during uh just a few weeks ago she was saying everybody should donate to planned parenthood and i just the idea of a black woman it's just it's fascinating it's like you need to learn your history i mean planned parenthood was literally founded by a eugenicist who did not want black people to procreate we fast forwarded to a year in which black americans that have a platform and actually can affect change are so ignorant about their own history that they are advocating for the services that were quite literally put in place to make sure that we did not have um a procreation amongst our community so it's just it's incredible she's astonishingly ignorant yeah and like i said she's a fun bubbly personality so could you imagine if lizzo actually advocated for something that wasn't that was that was good as opposed to that was actually positive that was beneficial for society and so she's doing this instacart thing and we were talking about this before we started rolling as well lizza was vegan that's a lie she claims that she is vegan that's a lie like that is obviously a lie i mean could it be i'm trying to actually think of what could be the vegan meal okay so we're gonna look at this okay so sheep as part of this campaign we get to see lizzo's shopping cart this is why she can claim that she is vegan because she has dairy-free ben and jerry's okay takis which are apparently vegan probably because it's all fake cheese uh uncrustables oh okay uh they've got skittles oreos coca-cola yeah she could be vegan there we go impossible meat yeah and then what is it it's not possible so maybe don't eat it yeah what i mean like literally disgusting i'm glad that she has some limes and lemons for probably margaritas yeah no she put that in for funsies but the the skittles and the coca-cola and the oreos i which are oreos vegan there's a whole debate about it that kind of terrifies me yeah because then what is what is the cream in the middle nothing it's chemicals that should if it is oils are vegan that should terrify everybody about oreos because it's disgusting also if uncrustables are vegan yeah what yeah that's not okay that means you're just gonna eat that's my like 3 p.m snack at work every day don't keep in the freezer for me well then i guess maybe she is i forgot coca-cola is in fact vegan and you could just put golden poison in your body but i'm just i'm not buying that she's vegan this is no this is literally a part of the instacart campaign this is a very cute i can't even say that it's like an annoying thing for someone like to like you're not vegan like it's probably her way of like clapping back at people who say like oh you're not healthy well i'm vegan like look at me making this like cucumber sandwich that's not still you're getting no sustenance um thankfully though the majority of people were calling her on this especially on twitter which is my favorite place in the world because they were dragging her because somebody said did did they have to get the william howard taft bathtub for lizzo to use in that instagram the internet does not care the internet has no feelings no not at all lizzo inspired me to eat three pizzas for breakfast vegan pizzas yeah obviously uh you can see this one how did they fit all of that oppression in one commercial yeah that's the thing i don't want people to miss which is that lizzo insists that she's oppressed and i i just don't understand if this is like self-oppression like you know i could and by the way it probably is because she's eating that way 100 there is no way that somebody that is that size is happy and i want to make that abundantly clear like she may have all the things that she has and she may have access to private jets and she may be smiling in these commercials and have you know a fat bank account hahaha pun maybe intended um but at the end of the day you cannot carry that much weight on you and wake up and be happy every day it's exhausting i mean i just finished being pregnant which is my only experience with being like obese you know like good for you and i by the end of it i'm just like this needs to be over like i cannot carry around this weight every single day all the side effects that come from it where you're just like like actually like my ankles started to hurt like they weren't but i was just like this is a lot of extra weight and i gained like 40 pounds you know especially because she is dancing on top of it and that's one thing i've talked about before is that she is talented because she can somehow carry around all this weight and dance and like do her tours that has to take a toll especially with like when you were eating like this and carrying around all that weight your gut is connected to your brain like her mental well-being it's like it is a scientific fact that if you are more overweight if you are not eating healthy if you're not getting the right nutrients it's like your brain is not going to be functioning it you know when you work out like that's the stuff that makes you happy you know what i mean when you get all these endorphins and as a stress relief the amount of stress that you're holding on think about even when you give in like i'm not gonna lie ate two burgers in and out yesterday and i don't feel that bad about it um because it was you know when you're in l.a you know but afterwards just the feeling it's like the immediate high of eating the food and then like two hours later i'm like i hate myself i'm just oh i feel like i feel like sloth and sluggish and i just wanted to get off the plane and run i just wanted to like just move my body and i did the next morning i was like and i felt amazing and so it's it's what she's advocating for really is depression you know unhappiness it's this is the oreos are you know eating oreos and pretending to be vegan and drinking cokes all day is not going to make you a a happy individual so i feel like people should know that because that's what hollywood does they advocate for lies that actually harm individuals who think that somehow it's going to render them happier freer her diet is basically the embodiment of like a 15 year old boy that hides in his room and plays video games all day yeah exactly the boy has a fast fast metabolism and yeah exactly you know which is why they're like this thin right we all like crap when we were young but she needs she needs to grow up and she needs to also understand that she has a platform and a responsible way to use it would be to say like i don't mind if you're a big girl my dad by the way just lost like 80 pounds so proud of him he struggled with obesity his entire life um and he finally just had a wake-up call when he got really sick from kobit because covet affects yes and everything by the way it's not just covet if you are clinically obese any illness you have your body cannot fight off and it is a threat to you and so my dad has lost 80 pounds and he is like he's just so happy and so i'm not shaming fat people that want to be better i am shaming fat people that are pretending that fat is a good way of living it's a lie it's just a lie because they are turning it on its head so that they don't have to take accountability they don't have to be personally responsible for anything it is the classic you know leftist trope of i have all these problems in my life but taking you know responsibility for it is much you know it's too much for me it's too hard so instead i'm gonna make everybody else you know bend a knee and change their way of you know thinking and science basically to think that this is healthy right and there's that fat campaign now which it literally on the cover of cosmopolitan it said fat is beautiful that's a lie that is an objective lie the idea that there's no objectivity and beauty is a lie so you can pursue this lifestyle of the lena dunham's and the lizzos of the world but you are going to find that it just produces raw in your life yeah well we will see she is only the first celebrity that has been on instacart i'm hoping that uh in the future they will at least have people that are advocating for something that is a little better us to say i mean i think that they are owned by amazon so we know that uh jeff bezos wants us all to eat bugs and which but jeff bezos by the way is in remarkable shape he works out every single day he can get to where he is in life by being a loser but the thing that happens is people that forge their path in capitalism in the free markets that want to stop everybody else from being able to do what they did and so that's exactly what we're seeing he's they are advocating for things that didn't help them get to where they're at and so here we have instacart and lizzo as the face of it by the way i love instacart i've used it for a very long time right it's a fantastic platform and now every time i open it up and i see that pop-up of like her face i'm like okay well you guys are really turning me off right totally at my expensive groceries without a lizzo in there well thank you so much for coming on comment section guys

I know you guys love hearing about all the new films that are coming out that are ridiculously political and that none of us are really gonna go see because there's a new film that came out this weekend and it is called Bros but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com to check out my merch collection Bros is the first gay rom-com ever produced by a big Studio obviously there have been gay storylines in hundreds of movies but this seems to be the first of its kind it was produced by Universal and in addition to it being about a gay couple every single cast member including supporting roles and Extras just the random people that you see walking around on the street they are all openly lgbtq I you not I don't know how they legally pulled that off since I don't think you can actually ask people their sexuality during the hiring process I don't know maybe the laws have changed and with how political all of these companies have gotten these days they probably have workarounds but I mean thankfully nimi skincare doesn't need those workarounds because rather than caring about political agendas they just care about delivering the best possible product Their Skin Care is 100 American made they even Source some of their ingredients from local American Farms and they actually work guys I've been using their products since January I talk about this all the time it is completely changed my skin I don't even mix them with any other products I just use their Daily Globe routine with the addition of their peptide cream I love it so much I want you all to go check it out go to nimiskincare.com use promo code Cooper at checkout for 15 off of your order you will not regret it and guys even if you're iffy about skin care a little moisturizer it'll change your life I promise just try it demiskincare.com promo code Cooper at checkout so back to an industry and a production company that obviously is not as based as any skincare the film Bros Stars Billy Eichner you probably know him from Billy on the Street he's the guy that in my opinion kind of obnoxiously runs up people on the street and goes hi Billy you want to talk about this and they like screams and runs around kind of what he's known for he also wrote the film and it is produced by Judd Apatow and I really like Judd Apatow I think he's super funny I enjoy his movies so I had pretty high hopes for this film when I saw the lineup didn't know anything about the storyline or what it was about but I like Judd but guys it came out this weekend and it flopped it only brought in 4.8 million dollars over opening weekend and they had a 22 million dollar budget which isn't crazy in the grand team of things but if they want to break even in the next couple of weeks they're gonna have to pump the gas because they're starting off incredibly slow I want us all to see what we're getting into so let's just watch the trailer together hey guys it's Bobby Lieber coming to you from the future home of the lgbtq plus Museum everyone is really excited they're totally getting along actual awareness week and no one has acknowledged it lesbian history month was in March nobody said a goddamn thing of course lesbians get a month and we get a week that's actually funny happy Pride happy Pride now I have to go to a pride party and you're both too old to be in the pool please leave if we don't do this we're letting the heterosexual terrorists win there are trans terrorists too Caitlyn Jenner so different for me you're very intense gay sex was more fun when straight people were uncomfortable with it oh my god do you guys remember straight people yeah they had a nice run oh my God there's there is so much to unpack here y'all first of all why did they put children doing a bottom dance at the end of the film I was gonna have semi-positive things to say and give these people the benefit of the doubt and then there are six-year-olds bottom dancing no canceled done out get out shut up get out I had High Hopes in the first 10 seconds and they're all fighting over whether they can have a lesbian week in a bisexual month I enjoyed that 10 seconds because it was real but the moment that I saw it was an lgbtq plus Museum and that it wasn't just a gay storyline but that it was literally a gay universe and an entire production yet like no the movie flopped it is inherently incredibly Progressive heterosexual terrorists yeah people are not going to want to see that I don't know what you were expecting [Music] it wrong it's kind of weird because 12 million people saw this trailer it was posted three months ago it got decent publicity I guess but I didn't hear much about it except for this interview on barstool's pardon my take and it's just really weird because you're gonna see how Billy Eichner is discussing the film and trying to promote it and he doesn't promote it as a gay film like they're being Sly just listen to this when Nick and Judd and I sat down to write it we never thought all right let's write a historic movie or you know we just thought let's write a really Frank funny movie you know like we don't get many great comedies these days and I think people have forgotten how much fun it is to go to a movie theater and laugh with your friends and sit in the dark and eat snacks and laugh your ass off and Escape our friend Bleak world for a couple of hours and actually watch something that makes you feel really good so if you just take that statement alone it's pretty base and I agree with him because even though it has a gay cast and it has a gay narrative he is saying that they weren't trying to make some gay historic movie they just wanted to make people laugh that is what entertainment should be if you're making a comedy you shouldn't be trying to exclusively just push some Progressive political agenda it should simply be about making the most humorous thing possible for the people sitting in that audience I have a hard time believing what he's saying since we just watched the trailer and we saw that literally everything in the entire film is political in a way because they literally took all of these steps to make it super extra plus lgbtq Extravaganza but you know I did want to give them the benefit of the doubt because he's right there are not a lot of great comedy so maybe they were actually trying but then the movie flopped and the narrative absolutely changed and guys we talk about this literally all the time this might sound redundant to you but I love it because it feels like this segment just wrote itself they make something woke then it flops and then they turn around and they blame the audience for being bigots and not being Progressive enough like they just weren't ready for it literally just right here it happened because here is the TMZ headline it says Billy eichenor thinks that straight audiences are to blame for Bros doing so badly at the box office saying not enough of them came out to support a gay rom-com I thought it wasn't supposed to be a big gay historic movie I thought you just wanted to make people laugh apparently you didn't do that well enough Billy here are his tweets last night I snuck in and sat at the back of a sold-out theater playing Bros in La obviously it sold out in LA it's La that's probably the only place I've ever been New York where it is going to sell out the audience howled with laughter start to finish yeah probably because they are all gay they burst into Applause at the end some were wiping tears away as they walked out it was truly magical really I am very very proud of this movie good for you good for you rolling stone already has Bros on the list of the best comedies of the 21st century what's also true is that at one point a theater chain called Universal and said that they were pulling the trailer because of the gay content Universal convinced them not to America yeah etc etc that's just the world we live in unfortunately even with glowing reviews a great Rotten Tomatoes score and a cinema score Etc straight people especially in certain parts of the country just didn't show up for Bros and that's disappointing but it is what it is so now you're literally making your movie a political statement you didn't show up for us you weren't there silence is violence give me a break I thought it wasn't supposed to be a historic gay movie I thought it was just supposed to be comedy sorry I need to calm down all right we're going he has one more reply everyone who isn't a homophobic weirdo should go see Bros tonight you will have a blast and it is special and uniquely powerful to see this particular story on a big screen especially for queer folks who don't get this opportunity often I love this movie so much go Bros this just this entire threat it just reeks of desperation you should not have to be begging people to go see your film and you should not have to be turning on a huge portion of the country saying I blame you for my movie flopping am I so out of touch we are seeing so many leftist tactics in play here it's not even funny the turning on audiences because they're not woke enough not taking responsibility deal with it move on lots of things flop maybe you are to blame for it because you executive produced it you starred in it and you wrote it like I don't think it's the straight people's fault but that's not all he also then posted this straight people go see Bros challenge you should not have to have a challenge to make people go see your movie that's just sad to be honest though it's kind of working because when I first saw that I went oh that's sad maybe I should go see it and then I was like no it's not gonna be good Brett don't see it but actually if you guys do want me to see it once it comes out on streaming we'll watch it we'll actually react to it that would be a wild ride people are utterly calling him on his which I loved because I was expecting to go into those comments and see a lot of people going like I can't believe those homophobic terrorists Republicans aren't going to go see that movie but actually it was a lot of people going okay calm down this person said Brokeback Mountain was very successful and it came out in 2005. Modern Family aired for 11 years was fairly popular fairly it was incredibly popular like that was a great freaking show it has nothing to do about it being a gay rom-com yes if you just make good art if you don't make it political if you make it about the characters and their story and their development then it will be good if you are pumping a woke agenda into literally every aspect of a film it takes all of the authenticity out of it it is incredibly contrived people don't want to see that it's not real you said in that part of my take episode Billy if you wanted people to be able to go to the theater and Escape seeing a contrived political comedy is not an escape for people that is literally what they do the moment that they log on to tick tock so I don't think that they want to see that another person replied and said I have skipped thousands of strength themed films that look unfunny too oh roasted another person said well first of all never heard of it second of late making a movie isn't about people coming out to support you the point is that you're supposed to make a movie that people heard about that is so awesome that people keep going to see it it is not supposed to be charity well he is a leftist so in his mind everything is about showing up and giving him free things just to put it blankly somebody else said damn they could have saved a lot of time with a straw poll to see what percent of the world is straight yeah like if you made it for gay people you should not have set your expectations very high with how many of them were going to be able to come out and support you you're gonna have to make it reach more than just that another person said the movie isn't for you but it's your fault that it bombed is a hell of a take yeah it's a hell of a take that happens literally all the time that's why I said I feel like the segment literally wrote itself because it is what I talk about constantly they hate that people do not buy what they're selling so rather than take responsibility and learn from it they blame us and continue wasting money and the thing that is even more annoying to me is that they then sit in their high tower thinking that by calling us all bigots and saying they were awful for not going to see their films that they are educating us and teaching us to show up no you're just making people angry at you this is not helping your cause whatsoever make good art make it authentic make people actually laugh and want to show up for you not for you personally but for the thing you have created and then you will be successful and you'll probably have a better chance of doing that if you would stop making things so damn political guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are

said man's playing chess not checkers and uh absolute giga chad i mean yeah he's unashamed", "LM6t8wPoOs4": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper we obviously have to talk about Kanye because Kanye has been in the news recently for some less than ideal things to put it mildly and today we're going to talk about all of that but especially his Infowars interview with Alex Jones because it was even more insane than I think any of us could have ever anticipated but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course if you want more content you can follow me on Tick Tock and on Instagram and Twitter and I'm Brett Cooper I'm going to just show you a few clips from this interview I can't even really explain what's going on here any description that I would give would be putting it too mildly also before I say anything about what he is talking about we have to acknowledge he's wearing like head to toe Balenciaga which we have been talking about this for the last week he claims that he wants to protect his children that was his whole ordeal with Kim earlier this year and now he's showing up head to toe in Balenciaga literally last night he tweeted out that he stands by Balenciaga and that ending child trafficking does not start or end with a fashion campaign read the freaking room dude already starting off on an absolutely god-awful note but anyone else can do what he's saying that counts because they've been frozen by the Jewish uh Banks so I I need to watch my meals well CNN says why people are evil Nazis so I mean I I disagree with both statements but I get the truth I don't like the word evil next to Nazis I think we need to look at oh my goodness just because you don't like one group doesn't mean yet but look I love Jewish people but I also love Nazis oh man well I have to disagree with that but listen we're gonna go to break I'm I'm the I'm the crazy one here we're all crazy the whole world's crazy and and the whole power structure's coming down this is absolutely lit this is lit lit lit lit lit lit number one show in the world right now everybody's tuning in everywhere the amount of times that Alex Jones has to go like all right we're gonna go to commercial let's calm down everybody let's go is wild because you watch Alex Jones and even if you like are a huge fan of his or you've never watched him before you know that the things he says are often very crazy this is like the only circumstance where he looks like the most sane person in the room that's all I can say somebody commented and said Alex is gonna have to search the back of his sofa for another trillion dear God somebody else said Alex Jones's face was priceless I don't think I've ever seen him embarrassed before the most nazi-like activities I've seen um and the Nazis in my view were thugs it shook people down to a lot of really bad things but they did good things too we're going to stop dissing the Nazis all the time okay you're not a Nazi you don't deserve to be called that a demonized well I I see I I see good things about Hitler also the Jew I love everyone and Jewish people are not going to tell me you can love um you know us and you can love what we're doing to you with the contracts and you can love what we're you know what we're pushing with the pornography but this guy that invented highways invented the very microphone that I use as a musician you can't say out loud that this person ever did anything good and I'm done with that I'm done with the classifications every human being has something of value that they brought to the table especially Hitler a Common Thread throughout this entire interview if you watch it is that Alex Jones keeps giving Kanye the opportunity to redeem himself to retract a statement to fully explain what he is trying to get at with these insane statements but instead Kanye just keeps digging himself deeper to the point that there really is no way to reason with him or find any understanding and then we have one last one to really drive the point home there is no shortage of these clips the interview was long but here's just another one yeah you stay there stay there dick boy does the studio this is uncensored folks we're going to come back again and we're gonna come back into the break and play a George Soros compilation of him on NPR me him on NPR and him on 60 Minutes saying the best time of his life was rounding up and killing Jews yea never killed any Jewish so I want to know how do I get the ADL to love me do I round up Jews in Nazi Germany do I get love then Schwarzenegger said he loved Hitler they gave him an award I'm just saying I don't like Nazis and I don't like what some of the mafias are doing either Hitler now obviously he's waving around some butterfly net in this clip but what you don't see is that for a large portion of the interview he had a bottle of Yoo-hoo chocolate milk sitting next to him which he was using both of those to represent uh Bibi Netanyahu but in this case he was not actually talking about the Israeli Prime Minister or anything like that he was just waving around trying to troll Alex Jones in my opinion the entire interview was a [\u00a0__\u00a0] show to put it lightly when I opened up Twitter this morning like nine out of my top trending topics were all about it whether it was Nick Fuentes or Alex Jones Infowars yay 24 Connie I mean it is everywhere everyone is talking about it but I think Sour Patch Lids formerly a Tim pool summed it up well when she just said who let because that's really the only thing you can say about it somebody replied to her and said looks like Tim dodged a bullet now the other commenter is referenced saying Tim pull bringing Kanye on the show that happened earlier this week Temple wanted to give Kanye again an opportunity to explain himself to dive deeper to have a conversation and maybe find some understanding and within the first 20 minutes Tim pressed Kanye on his statements about the Jewish people and Kanye just up and left literally just walked out look at this clip been extremely unfair to you who was they though we can't tell you they is I'm not using the I don't use the word as the way I guess you guys use I'm talking it is them though isn't it I mean because because when you think about it consider it what do I mean like uh uh okay so how about are you leaving are you afraid of the press he's on I'll say it right now um you got I I you guys want to bring that stuff up yeah you think yay is going to come in here and say Here's my opinion here's my suffering I'm gonna say I hear you and then he's gonna say and it was Jewish people and I'm gonna be like okay but don't you consider so I'm not gonna do this I refuse I I really really admire how timp will handled that because he obviously gave Kanye the platform to explain himself because we live in a country with free speech he has the right to do that he pushed him on it because he has been making ridiculous insane statements and he just up and left he is not even willing to sit there and back up the comments that he is making he did on Alex Jones for some reason he chose to stay on that show and Alex Jones is also pushing back on him but I think Tim just handled this really well there's a great article that was written about this entire Fiasco because Kanye flew into the wrong airport to see Tim Poole he ended up at some like strip mall hibachi grill with Nick Fuentes and there's photos of him like with fans and he looks absolutely like disheveled and depressed and then he walks out of the show and apparently steals cookies from Temple he's losing his mind but his bizarre moves are not just on air with these media pundits it's also on Twitter because after all of this he posted this I think it was last night and he said yay 24 love everyone hashtag love speech and he posted this picture which looks like a swastika in the middle of a star of David and if you zoom in on the file name it says yay 24 like dot PNG or whatever so many people are thinking that this is his idea of a campaign logo like he was wanting to debut it which is also very very weird people are also saying that this specific symbol has to do with some UFO alien religion I have no idea that is not a world that I live in I will let Matt Walsh pick that up if he wants to talk about the aliens and then after he boasted that he boasted that picture of Elon Musk looking very large and very pale on that yacht and he think he said something like this is going to go down in history as my last tweet and Elon responded and said that's fine I guess he was anticipating that he was going to get kicked off for all of his statements and we just posted the whole thing is just exhausting like we are not a serious country if this is what we are spending our time talking about in the political realm some people are saying that it is a permanent suspension but then Kanye also posted on Truth social and is like a screenshot of his suspension and it says like you have 11 hours and 59 minutes left and then you can post again I'm not really sure we will see I guess in 12 hours whether he comes back a lot of people are wondering you know how does this move from Elon and from Twitter relate to free speech and elon's alleged commitment to that on the platform somebody tweeted out and said the answer to Kanye is not censorship the opposite is true get him on as many shows as possible at the entire world outside of his cooked bubble see how batshit crazy he is Tim Poole and Alex Jones did that anomaly is tweeting similar sentiments saying he's pushing the boundaries of I love everyone in free speech in a way that has probably never been done before in this country in my lifetime it'll be interesting to see the counter-reaction to everything he has said it is going to be wild saying that it is Wild is an understatement John Stewart actually had a interesting take this was prior to the Infowars thing but this is just about censorship in general and I thought it was interesting hearing it from him it was a Kanye situation then obviously the the Kyrie situation and after the Kyrie situation Kyrie Irving uh on Twitter was trending the Jews I don't believe that censorship and and penalties are the way to end anti-Semitism or to not gain understanding I don't believe in that and I think it's the wrong way for us to approach it Kyrie Irving they suspended him from playing basketball penalizing somebody for having a thought I don't think is the way to change their minds or gain understanding this is a grown ass man and the idea that you would say to him we're going to put you in a timeout you have to sit in the corner and stare at the wall until you no longer believe that the Jews controlled the international banking system like we have to get past this in the country the ability to look people think this people think Jews control Hollywood people think Jews control the banks and to pretend that they don't and to not deal with it in a straightforward manner we will never gain any kind of understanding with each other the most interesting thing to come out of this in my mind was something Kanye said on his uh on his tour that he was doing after he said that and then he got interviewed by five you know different people uh because the media model is arson and conflict um he said something fascinating in my mind he said hurt people hurt people and if the point of all this is then to heal people the only way to heal a wound is to open it up and cleanse it and that stings that hurts but you have to expose it to air and I'm afraid that the general tenor of conversation that this country is cover it up bury it put it to the outskirts and don't deal with it basically what Jon Stewart is saying in this entire thing is that sunlight is the best disinfectant for bad ideas that's basically his take on how far this country has fallen into you know believing the discourse is bad and inhently evil that we can't Duke out bad ideas I think he's making an interesting point now on the other side of the argument in the response to Kanye's statements and everything that he's doing is that people are genuinely worried about his mental health and his well-being and they have a right to because this man has never been totally stable but he has dealt with bipolar disorder he has been open about you know not being stable many believe that it is why his music is so good but like Ben posted and he said yay is clearly suffering from a mental breakdown it is an act of Cruelty to have him on air at this point he needs treatment not a spotlight somebody else said the best part of the Connie and Alex Jones interview is just watching Alex a guy known for saying some crazy stuff he is shocked listening to Kanye like totally at a loss for words by how nuts this guy is in further news mental health issues are real seek help Kanye somebody else said Kanye's mentally ill man who is being taken advantage of by the media and political figures for their own needs I mean yeah when you make Alex Jones blush you know you're kind of losing standing just saying now obviously these are you know completely different examples but we can think about you know Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears or Amanda Bynes even we know that when people are not well the excessive media attention that gets put on these celebrities it it never works out in the end it only makes them suffer more and I feel like we could be seeing that with Kanye right now and you know I think that this entire situation it can maybe be boiled into these two you know individual little bubbles like the things that Kanye is saying are obviously incredibly crazy and we can discuss you know censorship and free speech and should be able to say this should he be Amplified but I think we also need to look at the fact that there's a real person behind these statements who in my opinion is not mentally well he is going through some kind of breakdown and so we also need to address that and I think they can sort of be addressed separately I don't want you guys to let me know what your thoughts are about that but you know we still have to have some Humanity in looking at this guy who obviously is not well and is kind of left out there alone and that last comment somebody said you know he's been taking advantage of by the media and political figures for needs I don't know whose needs he is fulfilling right now he's not making anybody look good like even Nick Fuentes and you know Milo yiannopoulos or whatever that's not bearing well for them in those you know celebrity situations when they do start to go crazy and the media is hounding them that often opens up the door for opportunists to come and take advantage of these people that are not well I mean think about Britney's conservatorship could that be happening with Nick Fuentes and Milo yiannopoulos who is now apparently Kanye's campaign manager I don't know and you know just as an aside back in 2018 media Outlets were reporting that Milo was in a lot of debt so again this could be a situation involving opportunists just saying to wrap all of this up the 2022 Kanye timeline it has been shocking and all of us here on the show we've been through a journey from you know starting with the Kim and Kanye divorce to him threatening Pete Davidson and you know the skeet and the Kanye situation then he kind of made some good music and then he made some good clothes and now he's suddenly running for president and now he is like literally losing his mind Kane is somebody that desperately needs help and we can you know debate censorship and the right approach to responding to everything that he is saying but I don't think that him jet setting around with the likes of Nick Fuentes and Milo yiannopoulos is doing him any good like he is not healthy guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "LenO2KtuKmU": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper we are back with yet another Disney story does Disney apparently can't stop screwing things up but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brad to check out my merch collection Disney has released a new short film on Disney plus with the media conglomerates very first plus size heroine which was actually surprising to me I feel like I have seen larger bodied whatever the left calls them characters in Disney films I obviously know that there are like the Pixar mom stereotypes are these shoes a tiny waist and like the huge butt and all that stuff but also they are cartoons they're not supposed to be realistic but I digress apparently that was an issue that needed to be solved so they have released this new short film and according to glamor magazine the short film called reflect is part of a new short film collection that they're doing here's the quote it says it will be part of Disney's short circuit series of experimental films focusing on body image and the importance of developing protecting your own self-esteem the short is directed by Hilary Bradfield a Disney Animation story artist she did Frozen two and in Kanto and it centers on a young ballet dancer who battles her own reflection as she overcomes self-doubt by channeling her own strength and power now there is not a individual trailer just for the short film but you can kind of see her dancing in here this is a trailer for the whole collection this was posted by Disney animation [Music] there she is [Music] a little ballet dancer you'll see [Music] I will say Disney has a way of making things so magical all cute like I watched this and I'm like [Music] the music it gets you going oh apparently this is their second season of doing these short films did not know that but also I don't subscribe to Disney plus I subscribe to daily wire plus I see what you did but anyway like I said Disney is so good at bringing people in it's just wild they know what they're doing this ballet film is the one in this collection that has gained the most traction it is trended on Twitter for the last two days and had a lot of people talking and the response was really not what Disney was expecting I feel like I think that they were hoping for you know thunderous Applause this is so exciting a lot of people had concerns actually now Daily Mail posted this which led the trending thread for most of yesterday but they said Disney unveiled their first plus-sized heroine in emotional film about body dysmorphia they had a bunch of comments that they included in the article of people being like oh this was so fantastic I feel represented all of that you can kind of see her better in this picture they posted like she looks like a cute little roly-poly she definitely has some fat on her you know what else has some fat on it a good rib eye from good ranchers and that rib eye is made even better because good ranchers has a 100 satisfaction guarantee unlike grocery stores where you have no idea where that meat comes from good ranchers is totally transparent their beef is either USDA prime or upper Choice their chicken is better than organic has no added hormones or antibiotics and their fish is caught Fresh then flash frozen and vacuum sealed so when it all arrives to your door all of that freshness is locked in and if you haven't tried good ranchers yet this is the time to do it because this month they are hosting a huge oktober feast when you go to goodrangers.com Cooper and use promo code Cooper at checkout you can get up to four pounds of free meat you will get two pounds if they're better than our game a chicken on any order plus an additional two pounds of ground wagyu beef on orders over 300 this is not a deal that you want to miss so go to goodranchers.com Cooper and use promo code Cooper a checkout again that is goodranters.com Cooper promo code Cooper at checkout but back to the story people were not as excited about this film as I am about good ranchers oktober Feast somebody commented and said so as somebody with body dysmorphia I'm scared that this will do more harm than good somebody else said great 43 of Americans are obese according to the CDC 78 of the covet deaths were related to obesity obesity leads to diabetes gout joint problems arthritis heart disease and now we're going to encourage more of it great another person said Disney isn't doing any favors to plus size young viewers by encouraging this there are young children who are obese and who have 1 000 plus calories of fatty sugary snacks daily these children if they don't approve will live a life worse in many categories and will likely die early but you know is a harsh fact but it is true and a lot of kids like especially before they hit a growth spurt they might get a little chunkier it's normal to have like weight fluctuations but in general in American society obesity is a very very serious problem especially in light of covid where that commenter was absolutely correct most kova deaths and serious reactions to kovid were people that were more overweight and were not healthy and with kids it's just important to know what is going in their bodies we should not start talking to people about health once they're an adult you have to start those healthy habits young so I agree with that but the responses did not stop there because even the people who had presumably been demanding this plus size representation were not happy just read all of these as a plus size woman I'm a bit offended that Disney made a plus-sized girl the star of a movie for the first time and then made the movie all about her body it's not uplifting or encouraging there's more to us than our body another person said look I get the concept but imagine this Disney creates their first plus size heroine in the movie absolutely has nothing to do with her size imagine that another person said Disney reveals its first ever plus size heroine but the entire [\u00a0__\u00a0] film is about her weight I'm so sick of this [\u00a0__\u00a0] give me a fat girl going on an adventure without her [\u00a0__\u00a0] body size having to be the whole point of the story we're not done yet somebody else said yeah I don't know why we can't have plus-sized Disney heroines without the whole storyline being about their weight maybe this is a hot take I don't know I'll see what you guys think of the comments but I don't mind that the short film is about her weight like she is a little girl in a ballet class we all have body images in ballet I did it seriously for 15 years and I literally stopped dancing because of the terrible eating habits that I had developed and the mental toll that it took because of my body image issues so it seems like a fine storyline because that is a very normal thing the ballet dancers go through even though that kind of has more to do with you know the teachers and the you know expectations of the ballet institution and all of that than just her weight but I digress I just think that's an important point to put in there but you know what is positive her weight isn't stopping her from dancing she's moving she's getting exercise she's jumping she's twirling that's good for her she's like that's what kids need to be doing they need to be doing that rather than sitting and getting fat in front of a TV eating Scooby Snacks those sure do look like Scooby Snacks now obviously I don't think that we should be normalizing obesity for the sake of the body positivity movement like we shouldn't be saying oh if you're 300 pounds you are so healthy you are so perfect don't change a thing like no you might want to change something but if it must be done I don't think that this is the worst way to go about it like at least there is a positive spin on it and because it is about her weight it is encouraging kids to don't let that stop them from doing anything get up work out exercise live a fit life but apparently all of the body positive social justice Warriors don't want her to think about her weight at all they just want this little girl character to be fat maybe eat some candy sit on the couch and not think about it because of course that would be internalized fat phobia if she you know wanted to talk about her weight and change that and of course have the probably hottest Middle School Giga chat fall in love with her in the storyline oh predictable I mean it's exhausting you cannot make everybody happy ever so my message to Hollywood and Disney and all these people if they would ever take two seconds to listen to me is stop trying to make content for a political agenda had you just released this cute little film of this girl being happy dancing without saying this is about body image issues and the body positive movement I probably would have been a lot happier with it because it's just a good story about a cute girl spitting and doing ballet and I relate to it because I've been through the same thing but instead you had to make it for a progressive audience and now you're just making everybody angry so stop just focus on telling good stories that's all we care about I promise hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "MkyoKVT2FLw": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper guys we are going to talk about Taylor Swift today now I had planned to talk about Taylor Swift earlier in the week because she just released this new album and I kind of wanted to dive into it the whole reaction to it but something told me to wait and I am so glad that I did because I have the perfect example of no matter how far you go for social justice Warriors it will never be enough they will [\u00a0__\u00a0] and they will moan until they find something to cancel you for and Taylor Swift is in the thick of it right now but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brad to check out my merch collection like I said Taylor Swift released her new album last week it's called Midnight this is her first album that she has released since she has started re-recording all of her old albums because she wants to own them that's a whole other story but this is her first new album in many years and I have my thoughts about the album itself and the music and some of the messages she's putting out like that being a 1950s housewife is literal oppression and that she wanted to chase Fame rather than being a bride which like girl that's not news but even still like I said I've listened to the album I made myself feel better about listening to the album because immediately after I went and I did my nimi skincare routine and nimi actually supports Traditional Values they support femininity they support true Womanhood they even give a portion of their profits back to organizations that do just that I'm sure you all know this by now but I have exclusively been using nimi skincare products for almost a year now and they have totally changed the game when it comes to my skin I personally use a mixture of their hydrate and protect routine and their daily glow up I love it it is perfect for me if you want to try them out go to nimiskincare.com and use promo code Cooper at checkout for 15 off again that is nimiskincare.com promo code Cooper at checkout for 15 off you can uh put on a face mask do a little exfoliating scrub while you listen to midnights and just know you're basically balancing out the equation in a way she released the music video for a song called anti hero which is on the album and people picked something out of it very quickly there is a shot in this music video where she stands on a scale and she looks down you see her feet and it reads fat I mean the horror the triggering horror how could she do that how could she put fat in a music video she is literally the worst person I've ever seen no I literally do not care Taylor Swift has been open over the years about how she has dealt with an eating disorder I mean the media has been awful to her for her entire life you can look up Taylor Swift Cowboys Taylor Swift Fat Taylor Swift's pregnant and you see all of these covers from Like Us Weekly and TMZ saying look at her she's looking a little heavy these days and it's because she's like semi-slouching and walking out of a dinner and they're calling her fat like obviously if you were famous in the height of that crazy rabid Paparazzi era and you're a woman especially you're probably gonna have some body image issues and she's been very open about that and that should be fine because this is her music video she's talking about her personal experience how she overcame that wrong guys it is fat phobic that is what I have learned on the internet this morning somebody commented and said it is possible to appreciate Taylor Swift and midnight as an artist and call her out on her blatant fat phobia Taylor Swift should have done better because even if it is relatable and an intrusive thought it is damaging and fat phobic listen to fat people when they tell you it is and yes you absolutely can have an eating disorder and still be fat phobic what what does that mean does that mean that me who dealt with very disordered eating as like a middle schooler in a high schooler does that mean that I was just inherently fat phobic because I was worried about gaining weight and was trying to stay super skinny for my very intense Russian ballet school like she is trying to be so inclusive and tolerant and help fat people encourage the body positivity movement and meanwhile she's basically saying that people who have Eating Disorders are just inherently fat phobic like this social justice Warrior language it doesn't actually move anything forward it just designates where we need to put our attention for the current thing but they don't stop with that one somebody else commented and said Taylor Swift's music video where she looks down at the scale where it says fat is a shitty way to describe her body image struggles fat people don't need to have it reiterated yet again that it's everyone's worst nightmare to look like us how else is she gonna explain that she was dealing with body image issues that she was worried about being fat how else social justice one two three nobody else said having insecurities is no longer allowed because it might make a fat person somewhere upset yeah accurate but somebody replied to that and said maybe famous people shouldn't contribute to other people's insecurities have you considered that this person's account is called free Palestine and their profile pictures black women matter it's not their job to make you comfortable it's no individual's job to make your life better that is your responsibility maybe if they love you if they respect you if they're a friend they'll you know go out on a limb for you but these celebrities are not all walking around going like oh I wonder what that person would think if I did this no they're living their own life calm down that's what we all should be doing it even made its way to tick tock this woman had some very aggressive thoughts Taylor Swift what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] dude being fat is not a bad thing and in five seconds of your music video you have successfully reinforced the idea that it is and believe me I'm empathetic that she has had an eating disorder and struggles with her relationship with food and herself but that does not give her permission to perpetuate a really harmful [\u00a0__\u00a0] narrative yeah it does it's her life and feeling fat or fearing being fat or not liking the way you look which is often what feeling fat actually is does not mean that you deal with these systemic issues that actual fat people actually deal with in 2010 to 2014 I was a counselor for teenage girls and if this music video had come out then and they would have seen their Idol standing on a scale looking disappointed and disgusted with herself and the word fat coming up I can only imagine how hurt and disgusted with themselves so many of them would have been and I'm sure there's a lot of people right now who are feeling that way like Taylor you have fat fans did you consider them it blows my mind that someone with this much power and influence who's all about empowerment and all this [\u00a0__\u00a0] would do something so short-sighted and out of touch and so I asked again what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Taylor Swift literally Taylor Swift is one of the most Progressive celebrities out there in our documentary that is on Netflix the main narrative throughout that documentary was her making the decision to like come out as Democrat and take a stand against Marcia Blackburn and even though I live in Tennessee I'm going to turn it like that was literally the entire thing she is the most social justice Warrior that you can get to the woman in this Tick Tock all I want to say is sounds like maybe you have some things that you need to work through because what I'm feeling what I am sensing is anger and that you feel called out and as a result you are regurgitating all of your anger and spewing it back on Taylor Swift because you have a problem that you have not fixed in your life so that is my advice to you work on yourself first before you go out into the world and project on everyone thankfully she had some rational people in the comments somebody said you're like how can I make this about me when it's literally a song delving deep into her own insecurities and struggles it is baffling I saw another comment where somebody went uh no being fat is bad she didn't like that she replied and she was very angry thankfully some people did have rational takes like this girl who made a response video she even posted it on Twitter which I really admire because she was getting a lot of hate for it and she still went ahead and posted it on Twitter because she felt like it was an important message and I just really appreciate it so here's her take that is not a bad thing and in five seconds of your music video you have successfully reinforced hello fellow fat weighing in on this with this response I want to try to do something on Tick Tock that isn't isn't done a lot which is create space for some nuance here's the Nuance I love this Creator I love their content I disagree with them on this but that doesn't mean they're a bad person and it's okay for both of us to have different opinions about the fact that this has to be a disclaimer is wild that's kind of the state of me the scene of Taylor standing on her scale and it says the word fat is commentary on Taylor's eating disorder which of course the original poster of this note but the important thing is context again in my opinion point of view in writing in art makes it like having to talk when it comes to the imagery and the messages that are portrayed it's pretty clear that Taylor is not saying the way she feels when she steps on a scale is normal good or healthy she's spoken at length about her own disordered eating in songs and interviews and everything else so I don't have a problem with her showing what her eating disorder sounds like to her because it's not her it's the disorder I personally think we have to have space for the problematic sides of ourselves and others can be portrayed in art but through a point of view that makes it clear that these are not normal or healthy just because she isn't a fat person experiencing systemic fat phobia doesn't mean that systemic fat phobia has not poisoned her brain and in my opinion I think she has a right to talk about what her eating disorder looks like I'm not a bad person for having that opinion no one who disagrees with me is a bad person for having a different opinion now obviously I can clearly tell that this woman and I probably disagree on a lot of things but I appreciate the fact that she has the common sense and the rationality to say hey point of view is important I literally and I said that while I was watching it and I think I said that it sounds like she's talking to kindergartners but I actually think like freshman high schoolers in an introductory English class is probably the better way to say it because she's teaching people about point of view and hey maybe you need to take into consideration context like the time period that something was written in or that person's lived experiences because that is what art and storytelling is all about and so many people on the left have seemingly forgotten that and make everything about them so yes I love what she is saying I love that she pointed out that this is a very nuanced issue especially for people who have dealt with eating disorders or maybe are overweight and are trying to change that I disagree with the whole systemic fat phobia thing because that was a bit wild but still this is an important point to make and I love that somebody is at least having a rational point of view about it Taylor apparently does not have that common sense obviously because she is a social justice Warrior and is quick to bow to these crazy people so she took down the music video had her team edit out that scene and just re-uploaded it because she is cocked 100 I'm totally fine saying that I still listen to her music but she is 100 cut but even though she did that she still cannot win because in another one of her music videos from this album that was just released she wanted to show that she was an ally a straight Ally so she made her love interest in the video a trans man here is a clip from it you see her in bed putting her hand on him and then here he is he's pretty well known he's been transitioned for a while and even still that was not enough because then leftist on Twitter accused her of queerbaiting which is apparently using lgbtq performers and stories and themes to Market a product or a project to lgbtq audiences so it's all like a marketing scheme it's not genuine she's not a real Ally she's just queer baiting to try to get us to watch cast a trans man in her music video and you're still not happy she is giving you the representation that you demand every single day and that is still not enough nothing you will ever do will be enough because these people are hell-bent on being miserable they are hell-bent on complaining every single day and making your life a living hell because they want to be a victim because it feels better I promise you'll be happier if you just focus on yourself and give it all up I swear hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "7K6JalV2X_s": "[Music] [Music] welcome

movie coming out it is called don't worry darling and it is starring chris pine harry styles and florence pew but it is not your average film and i say this knowing basically nothing about the plot of the film or anything like that but it is not your average film because of the chaos that has surrounded its production in its release so let me just give you some backstory because i truly believe

want to miss this because you should be cooking some steak while i tell you about this internet beef it's only right the film starts production in 2020 shia labeouf and florence pugh were originally set to be in the lead roles however there was some tension before they even started shooting this was in like the pre-production rehearsal period there were a lot of rumors about why this happened but to cut to the chase shia labeouf ends up leaving the film and wilde says that she fired him shia labeouf has a lot of abuse allegations against him and people were saying maybe florence didn't want to work with him maybe he needed to go to rehab that kind of stuff olivia wilde then hires harry styles to replace shiloh buff and star in the film because he happened to be not touring because it was kovid and of course harry styles is the you know one direction now huge mega pop star but he's been dabbling in acting for the last couple of years he had his first role in dunkirk a few years ago and he's had a couple of other roles but anyway he's now starring in this film then a couple months into production olivia wilde breaks up with jason sedakis who she has been engaged to for seven years and has children with and starts banging harry styles wanna come over and bang it out and then they start dating publicly the world goes crazy there's all of these videos of them you know making out at his concerts all of the stuff and then rumors come out the production is not going very well and florence and olivia were apparently not getting along on set florence was not promoting the film olivia would post all of these overly sappy you know videos and pictures of florence on film and florence ignored all of them was not responding to any of them but we're not done because now the film has finished shooting they're getting ready to release it and this spring shia labeouf comes forward and says hey i want to clear my name i was not actually fired i chose to leave the film and he apparently quit the film because olivia was terrible to work with and wasn't giving him ample rehearsal time with florence he has the texts and the emails to prove it and then last weekend the venice film festival happened and it is where don't worry darling was set to premiere the drama and the tension was high olivia and harry were avoiding each other at all costs because apparently they have now broken up florence only came to the red carpet and skipped all of the other press even though she was in venice hanging out which is ironic because on one of the press conferences olivia wilde was going you know what she's shooting this other film she just can't be here meanwhile florence was literally posting pictures in venice on vacation drinking aperol spritzes like guys we can see through it anyway the internet has been going crazy for weeks now i literally have an adrenaline rush explaining all of this because it has been so intense but here are some of my favorite tweets somebody posts the uh classic it's always sunny in philadelphia picture and says okay so olivia wilde presented herself as a feminist but made her lead work with an abuser and then replaced him with her i'm not an actor boyfriend that she cheated on her husband with and paid him more than florence pugh starting a feud also chris pine is there and got spit on also yes she did pay harry styles more than florence p apparently that caused problems apparently also florence p wanted an intimacy coordinator to work with shia labeouf because of all of his issues and olivia wilde didn't want to give her that oh and then of course i forgot this part uh people thought that harry styles spit on chris pine at the venice film festival here's the video all right here we go harry sit down [Music] it's so fast we got to see this again [Music] like what what is going on and now a lot of people have different stories about you know whether this actually happened or whether chris pine was just looking down and then picked up his sunglasses and chris pine spoke to people and said no i didn't get spin on that's ridiculous but then harry styles opened up his concert after the venice film festival and said this wonderful wonderful wonderful to be back in new york i just popped very quickly to venice to spit on chris pam so i don't know who to believe anymore like i am telling you guys it is reality tv i have been sitting on my phone watching this transpire on reddit and twitter and tick tock and this is better than anything that e could ever produce but that was not my favorite chris pine harry styles moment just watch this this is from one of the interviews thing about the movie is like it feels like a like a movie it feels like a real like you know go to the theater film movie that you know you kind of the reason why you go to watch something on the big screen i think i i am sofa we taught it like harry styles has been listening to way too many kamala speeches all of her we will beat kovid together because we are together as one beating coveted and i do believe that in the future together we will beat kova what's the other one that she did about space and time like space between us all is truly just the space i mean they apparently have the same pr specialist but my personal take after seeing all of this is that i think that all of these people have now just decided that they hate olivia wilde so much that they're just all trying to sabotage the film florence is not showing up she's like i do not care chris pine is looking like he is high out of his mind the entire festival harry styles is you know going on about the movie being a movie it's just utter chaos i don't think that they care or maybe harry styles is just a dud which is another very valid option somebody posted i need to be in venice i need to feel the tension in the air yeah that was literally me all weekend i don't know why jeremy boring did not send me to venice i gotta go take it up with him later somebody said i can't believe olivia wilde's pr team killed the queen to try to hide the rotten tomato score of don't worry darling yeah i will say the death of queen elizabeth ii really put a halt to all of this it's kind of picked up now but it was a good distraction from this chaos somebody said the last time i followed a news event in real time this closely was jan 6. god that's a nice part of the internet somebody said what was going down on the set of don't worry darling [Music] honestly yes i would love to know if florence and olivia had some kind of cat fight meanwhile chris pine was just sitting in a chair by himself looking off in the distance and harry styles was like twerking on the side and the last tweet i have people brought the queen back into it this person said rest in peace queen liz you would have loved finding out the rest of the harry styles florence pew olivia wild drama but i have seen many stories over the years of how queen elizabeth actually did really like the one direction boys and i think she's met them and she followed them so maybe in her final few weeks she was scrolling on twitter trying to keep up with the drama and if you have been following this story religiously like the queen and i were um you probably know that there is one part that i have left out and it is arguably the most important part probably the part that is most relevant to my audience and all of us so chris pine plays the villain in this film and he is a crazy cult leader type guy olivia wilde after production ended gave an interview and said this this is just a couple weeks ago we based that character on this insane man jordan peterson who is this pseudo-intellectual hero to the in-cell community wilde continued this guy jordan peterson is somebody that legitimizes certain aspects of the incels movement because he's a former professor and he's an author and he wears a suit so they feel like this is a real philosophy that should be taken seriously so olivia is saying that anybody who follows jordan peterson so me my team daily wire probably most of you guys but we are all in cells if you are saying that you have clearly never heard him speak you have probably heard sound bites from now this montages on facebook that make him look crazy or right-wing no all the man cares about is empowering people uplifting them to live to their best potential getting young men off of their couches out into the world to live fulfilling lives and contribute to society if that is a crime then we are truly doomed also olivia are you saying that just because somebody is a published academic and a tenured professor means that maybe they aren't credible and shouldn't be totally listened to because i could definitely find some common ground and apply that logic to every crazy professor at left-wing universities now obviously i love jordan peterson i think the man is brilliant if you disagree with him that's totally fine and that's your prerogative and that's you're right but to say that he is a pseudo-intellectual to say that his entire community and his entire audience or in cells i mean it is so obvious that you know nothing about him or anything that he teaches and that everything you have learned about him probably comes from left wing hit pieces from vox and vice and teen vogue but i mean there is a positive side to this because olivia wilde would not be creating characters based on jordan peterson jennifer lawrence would not be having nightmares about tucker carlson if they weren't afraid of us [Music] it's afraid it's afraid like we are living in their heads rent free we're on their radar and that is incredible in the grand scheme of things like somebody said jordan peterson isn't an in-cell god his entire ideology is to help men be better men instead of blaming the world and women for their problems anyone who listens to even one clip of his would know olivia wilde is basing her villain on a version of jp she made up in her head yes another person actually did bring jennifer lawrence into this and said olivia wilde bases her movie villain on semi-conservative jordan peterson jennifer lawrence has nightmares about tucker carlson hollywood is so scared and fragile maybe that's why they're such bullies yes everything about them is fragile they have this hold on all of these societal institutions but that hold is getting weaker and weaker and they know it i mean basic psychology teaches us that when people are afraid when they are feeling insecure they lash out basic psychology so what we are doing here is working they would not be this vocal about us if they did not see us as a threat i see that as a positive hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "cTfLRGgtCNY": "a 167 of girlhood Mr Hollywood who I'm right here oh he would zoom in on that I don't want to see any person waving their boobs around like that but especially not a man who doesn't really have boobs in the first place you are just making fun of women women do not go around doing that I don't know what stupid reality TV show you've been watching to try to learn about women that's not it somebody commented and said role-playing objectification the only way a person who's never experienced it can literally yes that wasn't a discussion about Hollywood objectifying women like the Harvey Weinstein like that kind of stuff and you decided to do that I don't want to live on this planet anymore no sit down somebody else said it's hard to support people who openly mock us exactly that's my main problem", "cfGtBJ9dOPw": "we now know that trauma like just makes it almost infinitely harder to learn when you're a child and we also now know that systemic racism is essentially an adverse childhood experience children who are black and brown in our schools are expected to be excellent while suffering from complex PTSD so you're lowering your expectations and your standards for an entire group of students because of the color of their skin how do these people not see that that literally is racism I know it's a sjw talking point but this is a white savior complex if I've ever seen one somebody replied and said bigotry of low expectations why is it that she doesn't seem to care about equally equipping everyone with the tools to live a quality successful life because that doesn't fit in their agenda they want everybody to be victims it is how this whole system keeps growing and festering I certainly lowered my expectation of these teachers yeah that is the group of people we need to lower our expectations for", "c3hvhakUiP0": "so since I've been talking a little bit more about my pronouns while I'm drying my beard oil I'll go ahead and tell you they Veer vids very vids that is the same order as he him his she her hers and they them theirs so in any sentence where you would use that pronoun you just replace it with whatever Neo pronoun of mine is equal right I get how to use them I'm just confused on two things I don't what does vase stand for are you embodied by I I kind of why are you Fanning your face drying your beard oil you have no beard like you are apparently just pulling things out of thin air in every aspect of your life why do they all have to record these things we get it substitute he him his himself they just want to get on Libs of tick tock at this point literally yes so they know that by posting this they're going to show up on my feed have you not learned apparently not", "cWsw4YAPOfk": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I have a HomeTown Story for you today I had already seen it over the weekend and that I had a bunch of people tagging me in it and commenting and saying where are you going to talk about this I think you're from this town don't worry we're covering it because it is disgusting I don't think I've discussed drag queens in a couple of weeks I kind of put it up there with my crazy climate protesters I gotta do some drag I gotta do some climate setting yourself on fire things every once in a while just to set the precedent for what we do on this channel so we're gonna go back to drive today oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] here we go again but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection the story is there was a family-friendly drag show held in my hometown of Chattanooga Tennessee this weekend I am unsurprisingly not phased by this at all because there are so many family-friendly prag shows across the country these days which is disgusting and very sad and I'm glad that people are standing up against it but I've sort of become numb to it because it is so filthy and I just get so angry at all the parents that I kind of have to control myself so Robbie Starbuck first broke the story he is based here in Nashville if you don't know who he is he's a fantastic political commentator used to be a director and producer he was actually running for congress here in Tennessee earlier this year but he's great definitely go follow him he posted this video on Twitter I got 20. but who cares [Music] oh this is my least favorite [Music] get away from the baby the child's like please Mom I'm hiding I don't want to see this person Jesus there's so many children does not end [Music] so that is all footage from an event held at wanderlinger Brewing Company in Chattanooga as part of Chattanooga's Pride Youth Day youth Pride so this is not an event where children just happened to be present no this is an event targeted towards children where there are fat men strutting around in drag queen get-ups with straps holding up their balls and children rubbing their hands over people's genital areas if you saw that video I cannot tell whether that is a woman playing Ariel or a man dressed up as Ariel but either way don't let your children touch strangers genitals stranger danger that should not be up for debate whatsoever somebody said what parents take their toddlers to bars to fondle and be fondled by drag queens I seriously want to know how anybody finds that appropriate yes my problem here is not just with the drag queens and the performers if that's what they want to do with their life that's fine I have a problem with the brewery holding this event for children but most of all I have a problem with the parents who think it is appropriate to put their children in these situations but obviously this is the world we live in right now where it is so normalized to the point that I'm sure that all these parents all these Millennial parents are thinking oh my kids are going to be so Progressive they're so woke they're ahead of their times no you're just being creepy the line has been drawn in the sand another person said it is sick it really is the parents are to blame if they didn't show up the drag queens would go away these poor innocent children are being subjected to this freak Show yes another person said exactly like Hooters yes and I also don't like Hooters Don't Take Your Kids there like we can agree on that this person apparently does not have a problem with it because they said OMG no they did a dance move the same one any of the young girls in attendance have probably done themselves if they're in dance first of all can you please write with some proper grammar would make my job a lot easier but another person replied and said do we need to check your hard drive I also have a problem with little girls dressed in [\u00a0__\u00a0] outfits kicking and rolling around and twerking on the floor Dance Mom style and pageant style it is all part of the hypersexualization of our culture which is now filtering down to children it's disgusting I don't want any of it so no that is not a dunk I don't want that either and the fact that you are even thinking about that and insinuating that that is okay is very creepy and very odd and somebody should go check your computer so this has started to make its way off of social media the Chattanooga police department and the mayor's office have been notified in an official manner however they allegedly can't do anything about it and if you are wondering Chattanooga has been run by democrats since 2013 and if the last two years have been any indication of how that works out you know it's not good so basically all I'm saying is that if you are a Chattanooga resident I hope that you are diversifying into gold and silver as a hedge against all this inflation because if you've been paying attention you know that the economy is not just struggling at a high Federal level no this all comes back to directly impact you which is why it is essential that you do not have all of your money tied to the US dollar bullion Max is a direct to Consumer precious metals retailer that will help you diversify your portfolio your gold and silver will be shipped directly to your door fully insured where you can store it in your own safe bury it in your yard whatever you need to do to keep it as far away from Nancy Pelosi as possible again if you want to try them out go to booleanmax.com Cooper I have put together a special patriotic silver starter kit just for you guys so go to bullyingmax.com Cooper because like I said these Community leaders are apparently not doing anything to protect their City whatsoever which is why the online commenters have stepped in to do the work for them they're doing what they do best which is trolling the accounts of this Brewery which is wonderlander brewing they have barely any followers across any social media platforms but they have now started restricting comments here you see their Twitter downtown Chattanooga independent Craft Brewery Tap Room local art lab music kitchen and family friendly hoorah not at all you weird freaks on their last tweet about a pint litter cleanup initiative that they were doing they just got slammed with comments somebody said serving their famous pedo IPA that's unfortunate another person said whoever signed off on this marketing ought to be fired yes another person said family friendly yeah family friendly my ass people had even started leaving reviews on Google discussing the drag show saying don't support this business this is disgusting this is something that they did but those have now been deleted like if you look up Wonder Linger on Google and you search by you know recent there are no reviews for the last two weeks they are just all gone but before they were deleted the business of course had to go in with some flippant responses this was one of my favorites he said hi Emily sorry our event upset you however this event is a family-friendly Pride event there is nothing new to grotesque about it if that is what you were insinuating it included Story Time and face painting I don't want to know what books you were reading you freaks anyone is welcome in our Tap Room unless they are hateful or judgmental towards others and that is all we are trying to show we wish you best of luck in your endeavors to find breweries to pay money towards it's not the worst thing I've ever seen but it is just oozing in past progression like how dare you say that we're doing anything against these children except letting them touch people's crotch and be held by weird fat men in lingerie oh God it's just disgusting I don't understand these people but even though this business is not facing any punishment or any ramifications for this event other Tennessee events and businesses are this is a family-friendly drag show being shut down in Memphis so just like five hours away what is that so those are the cops shutting down the show and then this drag queen who looks like a Walmart drag queen is chasing about going who told you to shut this down who told you to shut this down this is also the worst drag outfit I have ever seen why are you wearing a clown wig that ass is completely fake you need some help from the Kardashians because that does not look like a bubble butt whatsoever my friend but it is being shut down that is the main point that is what we should be focusing on there is a way for law enforcement to step in there is a way for Community leaders to get involved and say no we are drawing this Line in the Sand children should not be involved here and it is also up to businesses to say we are not going to fund this we're not going to sponsor this we're not going to host this that's what happened in Boise during Boise's Pride this summer all of these businesses pulled out when they realized that they were going to be children's Pride events they said you know what we were happy to support adults but when you involve children and drag queens and weird sexual stuff that's where we draw the line and it made national news so that is my call to action for you because we need more of that and we need more of what we just saw in Memphis Chattanooga cannot keep happening guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "LfqiEIk5zO0": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper today we are going to talk about Shadow Banning and censorship online but guys we know it exists we it has been happening for years now this is not new news but we were talking about it a lot right now because Elon just released part two of the Twitter files where he is releasing and exposing information on the corruption and the behind the scenes puppetry that goes on in Twitter to help mold our political and cultural landscape for lack of a better description and this one is really really good I didn't talk about the first Twitter files but this one deserves a spot on the show but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring that notification Bell and if you want even more content you can follow me on Twitter and on Instagram at I'm Brett Cooper and hopefully I won't get Shadow band or suppress I've actually been quite lucky with that I need to like knock on wood on wood knock on wood knock on wood this is like plywood plastic but anyway I have been pretty fortunate thus far uh so we'll see how this goes but anyway Elon is basically confirming everything that we already know with this drop and some people are kind of like this isn't News why are we talking about it but it's just nice to be Vindicated and say like we're not conspiracy theories this is actually happening but anyway let's get into it he said the Twitter files part two he retweets Barry Weiss and here she says thread the Twitter files part two Twitter's secret Blacklist now he enlisted journalist Barry Weiss to release the info she is fantastic her sub stack was I think arguably one of the greatest things come out of 2020. it is brilliant especially if you care about education I think some of her best work is on education anyway that is my pitch for Barry White she started with this first tweet and she said a new hashtag Twitter files investigation reveals that the teams of Twitter employees build blacklists prevent disfavor tweets from trending and actively limit the visibility of entire accounts or even trending topics all in secret without informing users again we knew that that oh we know but it's nice to hear it from The Source Twitter once had a mission quote to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers along the way barriers and nonetheless were erected yeah that is putting it mildly and moving on she showed the back end of Twitter with many accounts including podcast host Dan bongino who's put on a literal Blacklist here you can see his account there is his bio and you can see here search Blacklist but he has no strikes against him but he is still on a blacklist and here is Charlie Kirk who was slapped with a quote do not amplify tag again here's his account there is his bio here you can see that he has a recent abuse strike and has a do not amplify tag hit she busted a few other of these including some doctors that were talking about kovid that were labeled you know misinformation I mean there seriously exposing everything they are leaving nothing up to the imagination just like

forget to tell them the bread Cooper sent you in that post order survey you know in a weird way the Twitter files part two are as comforting as these pajamas because everything's coming true like it's like say I was right we were all right hot okay anyway moving on if you all remember correctly which I'm sure you do because none of you are dumb Twitter has repeatedly denied accusations of Shadow Banning and censorship Barry White said Twitter denied that it does such a thing in 2018 the head of legal policy and trust and the head of product says we do not Shadow ban they added and we certainly don't Shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology what many people call Shadow Banning Twitter Executives and employees call visibility filtering or VF multiple high-level sources confirmed its meeting think about visibility filtering as being a way for us to suppress what people see to different levels it is a very powerful tool one senior Twitter employee told us so they literally lied and they called it a different name in order to evade the truth and not have to explicitly say that they were Shadow Banning when that is literally what they were doing here is their tweet from that 2018 announcement when they said we don't Shadow Man especially not ideologies people are asking us if we Shadow ban we don't read more to get all the facts that was July 26 2018. now this is all done under the guise of you know hindering misinformation making sure everybody gets the real facts preventing hate speech all for the greater good I'm sure now even former CEO Jack Dorsey is on record denying all of this years ago he said following up on this with a lot more detail we don't Shadow ban we certainly don't Shadow band based on political viewpoints we do rank tweets by default to make Twitter more immediately relevant which can be flipped off more on ranking signals here and I think that this was back in 2012 or 2014 I'm not sure you guys can correct me on this but this screenshot has the date cut out of it he even denied all of this in front of Congress relatively recently Mr Dorsey welcome thanks for being here I want to read a few quotes about Twitter's practices and I just want you to tell me if they're true or not social media is being rigged to censor conservatives is that true of Twitter no like to me that they're centering people and they ought to stop it uh are you censoring people no Twitter Shadow Banning prominent Republicans bad is that true no so he gave a resounding no to all of those questions all of those statements he don't give an f about nothing and yet now all of this information is coming up which happened under his time as CEO and a lot of people are obviously pointing fingers but interestingly Elon is not as quick to pass blame to Jack as other people are he tweeted this out and said controversial decisions were often made without getting Jack's approval and he was unaware of systemic bias the inmates were running the Asylum Jack has a pure heart in my opinion which is an interesting take and I mean it is true that after Twitter files part one were released Jack did tweet out and tell Elon to release everything he said if the goal is transparency to build trust why not just release everything without filter and let people judge for themselves including all discussions around current and future actions make everything public now hashtag Twitter file so he is on board he wants all of this out in the open he even wants it to go out faster and quicker than Elon is doing because Elon is kind of giving us a trickle he's a showman you know he's putting on you know this whole spectacle Jack wants it all out now I mean I find it hard to believe that Jack Dorsey didn't know what was going on I mean if he didn't he's still at fault for leading a company down a rotten path where huge decisions like this were made without his knowledge or approval that's like a company cultural problem where he was off doing God knows what and people you know were running things behind the scenes that's a whole other discussion but still as CEO he was at the helm of all of this so I do think that he is included in criticisms of this entire operation now anyway back to the actual Twitter files Barry Weiss continued and said the group that decided whether to limit the reach of certain users was the Strategic response team global escalation team or SRT g-e-t it often handled up to 200 cases a day but there existed a level Beyond official ticketing beyond the rank and file moderators following the company's policy on paper that is the site integration policy policy escalation support known as sip PES or sip PES team this secret group included the head of legal policy and Trust the global head of trust and safety and subsequent CEOs Jack and Prague Etc this is where the biggest most politically sensitive decisions got made think High follower account controversial another Twitter employee told us for those there would be no ticket or anything and one of the main accounts that this special Elite censorship Squad targeted was Libs of tick tock and Barry Weiss posted this screenshot this is the entire back end of Libs of tick tock account you see here it says do not take action on user without consulting sip PES there's red flags everywhere email is protected IP addresses all of this stuff and then on the tags it's says high profile active account notification Spike Trends Blacklist recent abuse strike there's apparently a two strike count anyway they are following lives of tick tock hard also the other thing to point out is look at this kind of left side here you can see everything that they can look into direct messages that was one thing that people pointed out that really was not touched in this Twitter files can they read all of our DMS probably so I would not be surprised whatsoever but it's just interesting to see what they have access to on that side basically they are red flags all over this lives of tick tock account and she got seven suspensions in 2022 alone and every time she was told that it was because of her hateful content and she couldn't post for a week then she would inevitably you know finally get her account back but listen to what Barry Weiss posted in an internal sip PES Memo from October 2022 after her seventh suspension the committee acknowledged that Libs of tick tock has not directly engaged in behavior violative of the hateful conduct policy see here the site policy recommends placing Libs of tick tock on a seven day timeout at the account level based on the account's continued pattern of indirectly violating Twitter's hateful conduct policy by tweeting content that either leads to or intends to incite harassment so Libs of tick tock did not violate that policy they go on to say the site policy is not found explicitly violative tweets she didn't violate any policies you just wanted to suppress her because you didn't like how you felt when you saw what she post it but then they go on because they're not done digging themselves into another hole since its most recent time out while lipstick Tick Tock is out directly engaged in behavior violative of the hateful conduct policy the user has continued targeting individuals or Allies supporters of the lgbtqia plus Community for alleged misconduct because of that she got continuously kicked off now we need to compare this to this year when lives of tick tock had a picture of her house posted on Twitter with her address she was doxed not only by Taylor ends of the Washington Post but also by users on Twitter she reported these tweets that had threats against her in them and Twitter did nothing they said oh no this doesn't go against our policy sorry we won't take it down so sorry nope not but she didn't even violate any policies and she got suspended seven times and these Twitter employees are sitting in front of us saying nope this is not because of political bias whatsoever we do things by the books no you don't [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that is why this drop is so important because yes we knew there was suppression we were called conspiracy theorists for saying it but this is just even crazier than I could have expected Barry Weiss finished up the Twitter files by showing internal slack messages from employees on this committee one of which is especially relevant also you just have to listen to the language in this message because it is so fluffy and Progressive and you know that I'm always trying to like twist language to make themselves feel good and to kind of hide the underlining meaning and everything all right so this guy says one of the biggest areas I'd love research support on is read the non-removal policy interventions like disabling engagements and the de-amplification visibility filtering the hypothesis underlying much of what we've implemented is that if exposure to misinformation directly causes harm we should use remediations that reduce exposure and limiting the spread and virality of content as is a good way to do that just by reducing the prevalence of Raw May God Jack on board with implementing this for civic Integrity in the near term but we are going to need to make a more robust case to get this into our repertoire of policy remediations especially for our other policy domains so I love researchers POV on that so this person is wholeheartedly admitting that they reduce exposure because misinformation is so dangerous and scary to every fragile Little Snowflake but the other important part is that they got Jack on board so Jack knew about some part of this even if it was just in the short term or just for you know Civic Integrity elections but they were actively working to coerce him and convince him into thinking that this needed to be like a company site-wide policy so either these people lied in order to get this agenda pushed on Twitter or Jack is lying and has been lying and Elon is just being too nice to him either way we don't really have answers yet it's all very confusing and obviously Jack has not been at Twitter for a little bit now but his involvement in all of this is just very strange for people have thoughts somebody said Twitter Shadow bands well this is brand new information said no Twitter user ever we're not happy this came out because it's breaking news we all knew about it we're happy because now all the leftists who have been gaslighting us about it have backed themselves into a corner yes because like I said multiple times we have been called crazy we have been called conspiracy theorists people have been kicked off of social media for saying that people are getting Shadow banned and now we are hearing it from The Source itself that this was actually happening this means so much more than just you know exposing somebody through a project Veritas thing or showing data like look my followers aren't moving I'm stuck this is actually from the people who were making those decisions and this is just part two of this entire series at the End Barry White said that more information was going to be coming out about this exact situation Elon said he is actively working on how to make all of this information transparent so people can see when they were Shadow banned how they were if they need to appeal anything it's all coming out there is no hiding anymore and we are just getting started okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "kuCkE2Lvoxk": "all right today we're going to talk about how we can find out and how much we can find out and what it takes to get there okay so I find that level on my graph and I come horizontally to my gradient line where it intersects with my gradient line I'm going to come straight down to where it intersects with my around line that there is going to tell me how much I have to around to find out what I need to find out the more you run around the more you're going to find out if you stayed on here and you never around you'll never find out this man has taught me more about math and graphs in 51 seconds than my math teachers ever did and that's impressive now you know this reminds me of the hot crazy scale and I love it somebody said but what if it's not a linear relation can we optimize the ground find out ratio I love the internet", "9MT8QeRMyn8": "many of the greatest works i admire were done by men many men i have nothing but respect and admiration for i hate men because they bask in this admiration without the haunt without the daunt of the patriarchy without the daunt of standing in a pencil skirt in a room full of men because we learned how to play the game i hate men because it took me effort to gain what was their birthright can we get over this whole i hate men thing it is so outdated like that is so ten years ago i'm tired of it it does nothing somebody said i'm a man and i'm amazed now you're a man and you want to get laid that's why you're commenting it sorry somebody else said it took me effort to gain what was their birthright wow i'm sorry it takes effort for every single person in this life men didn't just come out of the womb and suddenly get a high-paying job and all of these rights whatever no like we all have to work for things like we are not unequal it is 2022 get over yourself", "OF6jr1fyx18": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I know that you guys have been dming me this video you've been saying what are you going to talk about it it just came out right when I had already planned two other episodes that I had to get three yesterday but don't worry we are going to talk about the latest project Veritas drop now project Veritas has been censored like crazy they're finally back on Twitter but their stories get suppressed all the time literally yesterday when I was doing research on this I typed in Project Veritas expecting this story about hashtag butt plug Dean to pop up and literally the only tweets that came up were from 2019. they are suppressed even on Twitter even after Elon has purchased it they're back with another insane drop and this is one that is actually very very important to me because it is dealing with the education system it's dealing with the sexualization of children and weird pedophilic adults but before we get into the story you guys know the drill make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and if you have not subscribed to daily wire plus yet now is the time because we are running a special holiday sale you can go to dailywire.com subscribe and use code holiday at checkout for 30 off of your annual membership if you're anything like me you are obviously Disturbed and disgusted by the content that is being put in front of our children and the curricula that they are being taught at school daily wire is fighting to combat that with our new children's programming it is starting next year in 2023 if you want to have great wholesome non-political content for your children use that code holiday and subscribe right now for an incredible deal I'm really excited for you guys to see this we are really working diligently behind the scenes to make sure that your kids have great content that they can consume on a less positive note let's get into why we're doing what we're doing why daily wire is investing 100 million dollars into kids content because Freaks Like These are teaching your children I had like our lgbtq plus Health Center come in they were passing around butt plugs and dildos to my students talking about queer sex using blue versus using spit you watch they're like how do you how does this [\u00a0__\u00a0] work like how does this work that's a really like a blue part of my job parents might be stunned to learn that Bruno's version of love and acceptance means handing out sex toys to underage students for four years and we had a track I'm glad you're there pass out cookies and brownies and do photos and everybody's cool with that like they're about clouds and the dildos nobody complaints I mean if the parents found out that they you know queer sex project Veritas reporters are like the saviors of our society at this point they go undercover they sit in front of these disgusting people and to be like oh really wow tell me more the dildos and the parents are okay I mean I would like lose my cool I would not be able to do that and this guy is so smug with how he is presenting all of this oh my God the drag queen shut up weirdo you have so much Freedom so much wiggle room so much money I mean with that too I don't know yeah they would it's like we I wouldn't even like run it by them like why would I run it by them they'd be like oh my God that's wonderful yeah with the kids that with the classroom before team 18. I just can't it's disgusting the thing that really stands out to me is that so many of these teachers they talk about it under the guise of like we need to protect kids and make sure that they're having safe sex and that they know things because kids are going to do them anyway it's part of the sex ed curriculum but this teacher is saying the quiet part out loud they're not just teaching sex to kids they're not just talking about how to use a condom how to prevent a pregnancy no let's talk about sexual pleasure as it relates to queer sex this is not about protecting people or having any kind of preventative measures or making sure that they you know have knowledge and understand as they're going into the adult world no this is weird like fetish creepy stuff that you think is important as a weird adult around 14 year olds ending up dildo I mean in what world is that appropriate I it's mind-boggling to me that this is even Up For Debate and in my opinion I feel like this is probably the biggest drop that project Veritas has ever done because in my mind this goes far beyond partisan interests this is not about political censorship it's not about election fraud this is about parents and children parental rights education this is something that everybody in this country should have a stake in and honestly does have a stake in and so many people on the left discount project Veritas even on the right because they think that they're Fringe they're extremists they only expose liberals they're not actually non-biased which is just not true you need to look at their track record and they have never lost a court battle ever they won against the New York Times which is insane Libs of tick tock did a great job working to amplify the story because like I said project Veritas is very suppressed on social media lives of tick tock says this is the dean of students at Francis W Parker School absolutely accurate so this is not just a teacher he is the dean of students at the upper school and within a day of this video going out the Francis W Parker School deleted their entire Twitter account they were getting spammed they were getting ratioed people were going after them so rightfully so they dipped which is not surprising whatsoever somebody replied under a Libs of tick tock's retweet of this video and said for those of you outside of Chicago this is possibly the most elite school in the city it is very very well known somebody else said I have several family members that attended Parker not surprised at all and also believe him when he says that none of the parents or trustees have any complaints I would not be surprised if they are on board with this I think a lot of people think that when they send their kids to private school that oh we're getting away from the public education stuff the government really isn't involved all of this woke stuff we're getting away no it often is more intense at these private schools because they can go further they can push further they have more money they don't have to follow any of the you know standards that the government is setting and that is even scarier this school is openly very Progressive it just takes a quick Google search and you can pull up their Wikipedia they tell you all about how they are you know molding these students in another video I think yesterday I said that it was a faith-based school for some reason when I saw Francis I thought that it was like Saint Francis it's not they are openly very atheist obviously I do not think they would be passing around dildos about plugs if they were religious school but you know what in 2022 sadly I would not be surprised now like I said this is not an uncommon type of thing to happen at private schools there have been many circumstances in the past couple of years where this has come to light and so many parents have stood by the curricula and the teachers the Administration has said yep that's totally fine yeah why are you guys so mad about this and it is all under the guise of comprehensive sex ed which is very much like critical race Theory and gender theory in schools where nobody can really Define it but then when we directly point to a circumstance where it's happening whether it's gender Theory whether it's this whether it's critical race Theory then they immediately turn and go well this is so great that it's being taught this is so fantastic we need more of this I'm like well you just said that it's not actually happening in school they completely flip the narrative depending on what's being put in front of them it is happening this school is not the only elite school that is pushing this type of thing Dalton School in New York City it is an elite private school on the Upper East Side here's a thing from last year New York Post Dalton parents enraged over masturbation videos for first graders this was a video that came out where these two little animated characters were talking with an adult saying I like playing with my thing how often should I do this every day they're like it's fine do it all the time and the girl's like I like rubbing this first graders this health teacher left the school on good terms and Dalton said we're so sad to see her go and you know do her new Endeavor she's gonna start being a private Health educator but you know what it's okay like they stood next to her some parents were upset but many of them were very on board with it here's another one for the New York Post Columbia prep another school in New York students and parents real after class on porn literacy this was in high school but this health class on porn literacy talked about only fans you have a history of only fans how to set up and only fans you know the morality of being a sex worker rather being a sex worker is right for you that was all part of that curriculum when they're dead they're just hookers obviously many parents got upset but again the culture had already been created where this was appropriate and so many parents were on board with it students were not coming home and being like wow this is really weird because that is a normal thing that happens in these schools now both of these are New York Elite prep schools they happened you know within a close radius of each other but there are countless other examples across the country from you know the comprehensive sex education side to critical race Theory to gender Theory just look into it it is wild actually have many family members that are in possibly one of the schools that I just mentioned and they are okay with that I mean parents are on board with it is what I am saying I have personal experience so all that being said not all private schools are the same so when you get your kids out of the public school system they are not inherently safe I feel like this is a major black pill moment right here you have to protect your children is all I'm saying get away from her you [\u00a0__\u00a0] but back to the story after the first video was filmed James O'Keefe and the project Veritas team went to the school in Chicago and tried to talk with the dean and the teachers and they filmed and released this video Joe Bruno hi there um James O'Keefe with project Veritas talking about giving anal sex toys and butt plugs to little children oh I'm running away they're just like I love James so much this man is such an Entertainer the joy that he gets confronting these sick people it brings me so much joy and I hope it brings joy to you too because he is thoroughly enjoying this this man just right up the stairs closed the door ran through all the students and I love that James like oh yeah you gave out butt plugs the teachers did you see that did your parents did you know that and the students are just like what's going on that's fine we've probably all seen dildos at this point even though we look like we're like eight years old anyway then he gets kicked off the premises this is the space where we're dismissing right can you actually Evacuate the party right but he was giving sex toys to the children we understand reporters asking someone a question we are leaving you bet receive will genuinely do not care I love that they put that clip in there about irony because that teacher being like their children here do not talk about that you want to talk about this being appropriate for children obviously those kids look like they are younger than the 14 year olds that were given the sex toys but still the cognitive dissonance is just astounding all the time every day it shocks me it never ceases to surprise me now this shocks me somebody replied to all of this and said it's only been 12 minutes since posted but has he been fired yet no actually he has not been fired because we live in a hypersexualized society and we are living amongst people that think that this is genuinely okay including the school like you are about to see like I'm so glad that there are still companies out there like good ranchers that actively stand against these gross values which is why they are the perfect company to support this holiday season you know a hard year on the economy means that essential practical gifts will be in high demand this year so give the most essential gift of all America's best meat and seafood from good Ranchers with discounts on orders of five boxes or more you can save on gifts for the whole family and when you give a box of good ranchers you are giving your friends and family a true Steakhouse experience with 100 American USDA prime and upper Choice cuts of beef and Chicken and Seafood other meat delivery companies and even your local grocery stores import lower Quality Meat from overseas and they get recalled all the time don't give your friends and family anything less than America's best this year go with good ranchers who has a 100 satisfaction guarantee and has never had to do a single recall and if you're not sure what to order good ranchers now offers gift cards so you can let your friends and family members choose for themselves or you can give the gift of a subscription and inflation proof someone's meat budget so go to goodranchers.com and use code Cooper at checkout to get 35 off of your gift again that is goodranchors.com code Cooper for 35 off of your purchase and you can rest easy knowing that the meat is fantastic I could make some really awful comment about meat and these sex toys but I'm not going to because I'm already riled up enough because this is how the school is handling it after project Veritas went to the school to film that second video they sent out this memo to the whole school Community they said dear Parker Community we are writing to let you know that one of our employees while at a conference last week was targeted by a right-wing Fringe group of individuals that seeks to undermine and manipulate the diversity equity and inclusion and belonging work in schools since what did we include the beat what does that mean is belonging the addition of sex toys B for butt plugs anybody possibly anyway this evening the group showed up outside of the school and attempted to confront and Ambush this employee with aggressive questions that was not aggressive he said hello is this you can you confirm that you gave students these devices that you already confirmed on video he was very polite it's always very polite enjoyable confrontation because he's having such a great time anyway continuing on this incident is very upsetting and we stand in full support of our employee we have put additional security measures in place we will notify the community should there be any additional activity from this group regarding the school or the employee and then they say do not talk to anybody from this Fringe group they don't even say who project Veritas is so this is what was happening behind the scenes then the original video that we watched the first one went out and became viral leaving the school to put out this memo yesterday which is even more appalling dear Parker community at Parker we care deeply about the health and well-being and development of our students our programs are designed to help cultivate not only physical and emotional well-being but also a strong sense of belonging this is Central to our mission yeah so apparently the B is for butt plugs not belonging because apparently you think that weird sex toys and drag queens is part of belonging this is why we are heartbroken to learn that one of our colleagues words have been severely misrepresented for a malicious purpose project Veritas is a far-right activist group it's not an activist group it's journalism you people that produces deceptively edited videos of secret recordings in an effort to discredit mainstream media organizations Progressive groups and educational institutions okay if project Veritas maliciously edited that video then in what context was the dean of students talking about students playing with dildos Are you seriously trying to say that there was some other instance maybe it was not that pride of it but in another instance this man was in the room while sex stores were being handed out and it's better it's more appropriate than what project Veritas released because that that would actually like honestly Shock Me If You you could actually provide me evidence of that I would be interested but I highly doubt that you can last week at a n a i s the National Association of Independent Schools a people of color conference one of our employees was targeted by this group and misled to believe that he was conversing with another conference attendee over at Coffee he was filmed without his knowledge or permission while describing one example of our inclusive lgbtq plus affirming and comprehensive approach to sex education this group has now edited this video with malicious intent and launched it publicly tonight please note in all bold letters that this video contains descriptive language if you choose to view it we ask you not to share it because it will add to its viral power no you don't want it to be shared because your school is getting slammed rightfully so it has descriptive language is it is too inappropriate for parents and students to share then why are those sex toys being handed out to students in the first place again it's the irony of there are children here please don't talk about these sex toys even though they were handed out to children at your school in the first place now this is the kicker the Parker administrators and The Parkers Board of Trustees support Parker's programming the strength and inclusivity of our curriculum and the dedicated and talented faculty and staff to teach it we are sickened by this group's deceptive tactics their Invasion during a people of color conference and they're attacking the lgbtq plus Community we will be meeting with middle and upper school students tomorrow to offer support and guidance they are standing by all of this they are not saying oh I'm so sorry we took this a step too far they wholeheartedly support this are standing by that dean of students they believe that this is totally appropriate that it's helping students that is the sick and twisted philosophy that we live amongst the fact that this is actually happening and being defended is mind-boggling to me this is how you know that the parents know exactly what they signed up for and the fact that they support it now here is the principal Dan who is sending out these memos and this weird little freak teacher here's Dan right here and here's Joe Bruno they both they kind of have similar energies in my opinion I don't know what it is the smile the something I don't really know it really adds up though it's similar energy now in addition to the school defending its practices alumni were also jumping in on Twitter this one guy said I've rarely been as proud of my school fwp as I am now seeing them teach number one sex ed number two sex ed that doesn't assume heterosexuality and three seeing that they are showing kids from a young age the queerness has nothing to be ashamed of I'm sending in a new donation to Parker that's not what they were doing you can safely and responsibly and age appropriately teach sex ed which is necessary in schools while also saying not everybody is straight and that's fine and teach safe sex practices to age-appropriate students and that's fine that's not what they were doing they were talking about sexual pleasure and queer sex here's how to have sex with butt plugs and then by default are they basically just diluting queerness and gay people down to butt plugs and dildos and having sex I have defended the lgbtq community and said no they are not all just like sexual deviants trying to impose this on children we cannot say that all lgbtq people are groomers and then they're academics and people in schools who are resigning Pride week to dress to be about gay sex I'm like you're making it impossible obviously I stand by my statement because not all gay people not all lesbians they are not like this it's the weird leftist social justice freaks that are crossing the line in the sand of protecting children and you're making everybody look bad I talked briefly about this comprehensive sex ed at the beginning and people in the comments were showing examples of other curricula and lesson plans under that umbrella so I just want to show it again to prove this is not just at the school this is all around here's considerations about using penis models in school it says make sure that you are using Anatomy local models or images for demonstrations that they match the variety of skin tones of your students let's make sure that we have penis representation here's another one make sure to not assume that all of your students will have behaviors that involve a penis another one make sure not to assume that everyone who has a penis identifies as a male and not everyone who has a vulva identifies as a female this is on the guidance for sex ed here's another one um how many times is too many to masturbate in one day this is linked in the Wisconsin Department of Instruction guidance and they say you can do it as much as you want there's no too many times go ahead go forth that is part of the guidance that the state of Wisconsin is giving for comprehensive sexual education it is literally everywhere somebody replied and said if this is real and allowed to happen then it is the most disturbing thing I've heard in 2022 and that is saying a lot correct between this and the Twitter files it's exhausting and it's disheartening and there really are very very few safe places and safe people for children anymore and that's incredibly incredibly sad because we're not just talking about you know protecting an innocent class we are talking about the development and the protection of future Generations people who are going to be leading our society who are going to be in positions of power we're setting this generation up for failure in every sense of the word whether it be like these ridiculous ideologies the inappropriate acts that we are putting in front of them allowing them to dismember their bodies for what is basically a social contagion Trend it's awful like there is no light way to put it but you know what there are people that will still defend it like this commenter even if this is real it's definitely a little bit off the way he goes about it but it's still just teaching kids about sexuality at the end of the day but of course conservatives don't like that they truly do not see the problem because this is just teaching about sexuality it's fine and it's definitely a political issue because those stuffy conservatives don't like it I don't really even consider myself a traditional conservative this is not just some political right and left issue there is a True Values misalignment I'm using that line from Harry's Razors when they distance themselves from daily wire but it's very very true like we are literally living on different planets conservatives do not have a problem with teaching sex ed it's important for people to learn biological things about their body but what they do have a problem with is you bringing dildos and butt plugs and sex toys and drag queens in to literally groom their children and that should not be something that is controversial that is something that should not just be conservatives talking about and it is shocking that it is okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "ySsHwHQaap8": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper today we are going to be talking about one of my very very favorite people on the internet alex stein you guys have probably seen his viral videos where he goes and he trolls random city councils i think his first really big one was one where he went and did a vaccine song it was like everybody get vaccinated and all this stuff i want the vaccine in my life i want the vaccine for my wife i want to vaccinate you all day long he also did one where he pretended to be like a teammate of leah thomas essentially and came in a like a women's bathing suit he acts like a lib and then goes so extreme and usually the city council members try to shut him down he's even called into congressional hearings he's ridiculous he's hysterical and he doesn't just stop with trolling libs i also really like the fact that he does you know go after establishment republicans as well he really just goes after any kind of hypocritical elite corrupted government official he's great so go follow him but he made major waves this weekend for a video that you've probably seen by now in some way or another but before we get into it and you hear my thoughts make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel and ring that little notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode alex stein went to dc for some events and for some news hits and he went to the capitol to get some content and this happened aoc my favorite big booty latina i love you aoc you're my favorite she wants to kill babies but she's still beautiful i love it my favorite aoc nice to meet you afc look how sexy she looks in that dress i love it aoc hot like a tamale okay so like absolutely ridiculous at first glance pretty harmless now if you watch alex's videos you know that most of the time he's very lighthearted like this he's just poking fun at people he's a comedian aoc apparently did not take it as lighthearted at all she immediately got on twitter she said this guy followed me up on the capitol saying look at your juicy ass you blank latina and a bunch of other disgusting garbage in front of an officer who let him continue so i'm just going to share his photo here since there's no other protection ladies and anyone avoid this guy and she posts this weird-ass close-up photo she deleted it and then she came back a few minutes later and said i posted about a deeply disgusting incident that happened today on the capitol steps but i took it down because it is clearly someone seeking extremist fame it's just a bummer to work in an institution that openly allowed this but talking about it only invites more just really sad okay first of all it's a bummer to work in an institution that openly allows this or a public figure you are putting yourself online in front of millions of americans every single day in government on social media expecting that you're not going to get heckled or the people are not going to hate you is absolutely ridiculous i am shocked shocked well not that shock now she's saying that she took down that first tweet with the weird photo and the random line calling it like an aggressive incident she said she took it down because he was seeking fame but then even though she took it down she posted the video herself two minutes later she says here is a video he posted of the incident i was actually walking over to deck him because if nobody will protect us and i'll do it myself but i needed to catch a vote more than a case today mike drop aoc so she's claiming that this man alex stein is seeking extremist fame and publicizing his face only invites more and then she literally goes and posts the video congratulations you played yourself i enjoyed the fact that she tweeted that she was walking over to deck him let's just rewatch this video real quick you walked over you threw up a peace sign and said wanna take a selfie no to use a line of your own it seems like you're throwing peace signs not fists you wanted to go catch a vote not a case no i don't think you were ever going to catch a case maybe you're just wanting everybody to go oh i'm so sorry aoc your ass really is great like i'm so sorry that the conservative made fun of you but your ass really is great like i don't know what she wants i also need to point out that she is with her fiance the guy in the green shirt who's walking the dog that's her fiance it's the red-headed dude he just moves along now i like alex stein and i think that this is funny but if i was getting heckled by anybody i would like my significant other to at least try to get in between me and him not just turn his back and walk up the stairs with my little rat dog but also let's be fair the man is marrying aoc so he can't be that masculine maybe this is just too much to expect of him protecting his future wife is probably just a sign of toxic masculinity and white privilege or honestly maybe he's just exhausted from having to deal with her every day and was happy to pass her along to somebody else if so he probably needs to use some bond charge products to re-optimize his health as you all know by now bond charge was formerly blue blocks but they have rebranded and expanded into a much more significant

to help you not be a beta and not underperform like aoc's fiance moving on she of course then went to her infamous instagram stories where all of the juicy content goes down and she honestly just made the situation even worse oh my god she took down the the video was taken down see this guy right there right there he when i was walking up um he said hey there's this look at that big ass look at that big juicy booty this latina like whatever you know all the bunch of racist sexist stuff this institution is not designed to protect people and it's really hard and it's really sad that my only recourse is to just let you know about it but that's the institution we're in she is so dramatic i also love i mean it's such a classic leftist tactic that every problem that they face is the institution they can never be specific about what the actual problem is what the root of the issue is it's always just oh it's systemic it's the institution we can't do anything about it we've got to burn it all down we got to get rid of all of it because it is the institution what do you mean by that can you be more specific every single thing that they say is intentionally vague and generalized so that they can use emotions to convince people that the entire world is pitted against them you got trolled by an internet comedian in the grand scheme of things that isn't so terrible and you posting that video with your fake little whimper in your voice is not helping you at all this is where all of the memes came in first of all we have aoc's newest single that is dropping [Music] big soon booty look at that big ass look at that big juicy booty big juicy booty big juicy booty look at that big ass look at that big juicy booty i love the internet i just love it it's important to note that um all of these you know twerking videos that are used in this beautiful video they're all from protests from her side of the aisle pro-abortion pride all of that stuff those are your people aoc seems like y'all love some ass is all i'm saying these are also her latest thoughts on donald trump look at that big ass look at that big juicy booty i'm so glad that she's gotten over her trump derangement syndrome and is really appreciating uh donald trump for what his mama gave him to be honest back to twitter this girl said aoc is lucky someone said her ass was big so this is built like a fly swatter stephen crowder said aoc you can't mock the harassment of justice kavanaugh and then five seconds later complained about being harassed and expect sympathy yes you can't have your cake and eat it too brat very strong very to the point i agree alex stein said school teachers constantly get caught sexualizing children but i tell afc she is sexy one time and the liberal world order has a full-blown panic attack he's not wrong i've said it before but our society is hyper-sexualized this is kind of the norm i mean it's sort of sad you go outside and you get cat-called that's kind of normal they also started bringing up her old tweets about protesting kind of hitting on what stephen crowder was saying like this one where she tweeted in 2020 the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable activists take that discomfort with the status quo and advocate for concrete policy changes popular support often starts small and grows to folks who complain protest demands make others uncomfortable that's the point they were also making comparisons like this one from greg price aoc called the cops five times because alex stein told her she has a nice ass but mocked brett kavanaugh when a left-wing mob forced him to leave through the back of a restaurant here are the two tweets inside the capitol right now rep aoc just asked to speak with female and lgbt reporters to warn us that the man who harassed her is affiliated with credentialed news outlets she said that her staff called the capitol police five times to get them to do something a tweet next to this from aoc is in response to that kavanaugh situation she says poor guy he left before his souffle because he decided half the country should risk death if they have an ectopic pregnancy within the wrong state lines it's all very unfair to him the least they could do is let him eat cake first of all that tweet is just factually wrong but greg and all of these people comparing the situation to her old tweets are making a very valid point but there were some people even harsh critics of aoc who thought that the heckling wasn't warranted or a good look specifically because it was targeted at her appearance rather than her policies and alex did mention something about abortion he was saying you know she wants to kill babies but at least she has a good ass whatever in general it was just him hollering at her it's never fun to have your body you know get called out or picked apart as a public figure it kind of comes with the territory but with somebody like aoc who has been so passionate and so outspoken about getting in people's faces make them uncomfortable yell at all the conservatives whatever i'm not too angry about this if you can't take it don't dish it out aoc why are you bullying me the last part of the story is that alex stein was in dc to do a comedy show that evening in all of aoc's unbridled rage in addition to calling the cops five times she also managed to get the venue to cancel his show but alex was undeterred he posted this omg aoc got the uh dc arts center to cancel my comedy show tonight full refund for all of the people that bought tickets if you still want to see me perform come to the capitol tonight at 9 30 p.m and at 9 30 p.m this crowd of fans showed up to support him he posted this video [Applause] on the ground all the time this is the future of the world new world order we're coming i mean the guy is such a legend he is constantly positive he is always finding the humor in things he is undeterred people try to cancel him on a daily basis and he never bows down i mean this is just another lesson here is again never apologize or bend the knee to the mob it is a death sentence in the midst of a left-wing cancellation attempt be like alex not like aoc don't call the cops just do a comedy show on capitol steps that's what we should all be doing apparently guys we are adding new comments section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "vO_EyjNnryg": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I am sad to tell you all that we have lost yet another Institution for Women American Girl doll well actually I feel like we did start losing them back in the late 90s when they were acquired by Mattel and that's just a whole other thing that I'll talk about later but anyway for those of you who are probably my age or a little older we grew up with American Girl dolls the historic dolls I think I still have some of mine it was a huge huge part of my childhood and I think we all sort of knew that they were going to become woke but it is official now they have fallen to the gender ideology and the sexualization of children dumpster fire before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring that notification Bell and if you want even more content you can follow me at I'm Brett Cooper on Instagram and Twitter God it is not even like a dumpster fire it's just disgusting American Girl is promoting puberty blockers and transgenderism in their new smart girls guide book so they have this series it's called the SMART Girls guide to yada yada yada whatever I really didn't read a ton of those books my mom didn't love them because they kind of promoted dating at a young age and there was like weird just conversations that my mom didn't think were appropriate at a young age but I loved the other books that American Girl wrote and I was exposed to these with my friends and that sort of thing anyway they have a new installment in the series it is called the SMART Girls guide to body image How To Love Yourself live life to the fullest and celebrate all kinds of bodies on the surface that should be fine if this book really did focus on body image issues and teaching girls how to take care of themselves and be healthy and not feed into diet culture just get their daily dose of fruits and vegetables that would be one thing actually guys if you need to get your dose of fruits and vegetables you should try balance of nature balance of nature fruits and veggies are the best way to make sure that you are getting your essential nutritional ingredients every single day their products are 100 whole food and balance of nature uses a cold vacuum process that preserves the natural phytonutrients and whole fruits and vegetables and encapsulates them for easy daily consumption balance of nature sent me a bunch of their products a couple of months ago and I have loved adding them to my daily supplement routine it is such an easy and convenient way to make sure that I am upping my game I feel like I have more energy I'm more confident in my health I just love it and I was excited to find out that the products are also a certified kosher when you're disciplined enough to take care of your health you reap all kinds of benefits you have more energy you have less fatigue and better focus and consuming the right balance of fruits and vegetables every day is an important first step and I know that that is something that we are literally taught in elementary school but like as I've gotten older I feel like it's something that I've sort of Forgotten in a way like I'm so concerned with work and pounding coffee so that I can meet deadlines and running from Shoot to shoot and whatever like there are days when I might work out and I think that I'm taking care of my health but I've literally only eaten a protein bar cup of coffee and some popcorn so taking balance of nature at least eases my stress so I know that I'm covered at least on the essential nutrients so as a special holiday offer balance of nature is offering 25 off plus a free fibrant spice which is their fiber powder with your first preferred order of fruits and veggies this offer can end at any time so go jump on it now go to balanceofnature.com use promo code Cooper at checkout for 25 off plus that free fiber and spice again that is balanceofnature.com promo code Cooper I would be shocked if American Girl doll actually included something that is as Baseline as this considering that they are concerning themselves with weird gender identity conversations now on the surface this seems fine but within like a few pages they started politicizing it all all and like I said I I used to love their books and their products I thought that American Girl gave important information and most importantly they told amazing fictional stories about interesting and capable and complex young women and they had these dolls and they had all these books that you know came with the dolls but now they're just publishing this garbage on the regular they've even gotten rid of some of their historical dolls because of course they are problematic now and to be fair my mom really only bought me those historical dolls and the historical books and then any non-fiction that she got me I think was pre Mattel acquiring them another win by her it's kind of like her not letting me watch Disney after they became super corporate because the more corporate that these companies become like Disney the more that the magic and the innocence of them disappears and is exchanged for commercialization and political brownie points and them just trying to own the minds of children own the mines and wallets of children and their parents basically but I'd address into the book we go here's one of the pages gender Joy oh that's great so we have girls we have a boy we have a possibly a they them some purple hair you name it we've got it all here but they say the way you show your gender to the world through closing behaviors is your gender expression your gender expression can be feminine masculine or somewhere in between and it might change maybe you'll experiment with bright dresses and long feminine hairstyles or you might try baggy shorts plaid shirts and a buzzed haircut your gender expression should make you feel at home in your body if we were just talking about girls expressing themselves and telling young women that you know you don't have to wear a bright pink fluffy dress if you don't want to you can wear overalls you can wear sweatshirts that's great that is something that I probably would have loved to hear as a young girl because I really did not fit into the normal like feminine especially like in the Deep South I did not fit into that mold at all but gender expression we know what that phrase carries in this day and age and it might be okay if they just stopped with this page but they don't somebody commented and said do they have a boy doll yet the worst address probably coming soon they already have like boys content like the smart Boys Guide it's not exactly called that but they have those books and I think they have boy dolls now like one is named Bryant I think it's like Kobe Bryant but we'll see maybe they'll have women dresses who knows somebody else said this is so incredibly sad I remember the Christmas my grandmother gave me Felicity I love Felicity she had the horse I had the horse I remember I got it after I got Felicity it was a big deal anyway sorry oh good time she made history come alive my family even took a trip to Williamsburg we did too we went to Williamsburg this is such a huge part of my childhood uh you cannot buy Felicity anymore but you could buy Bryant there we go a boy with a magical dragon amazing okay anyway but like I said that first page is not the worst they dig themselves deeper into this hole we get into transgenderism here we go being transgender is not an illness or something to be ashamed of if you're questioning your gender identity or if you already know for sure that you're trans or non-binary you wrote this book for children this is for like eight to ten year olds pre-middle School they do not know whether they are trans or non-binary unless they're reading this content or their weird creepy teachers are telling them that they are children do not know their brains are not fully developed I just want to get that out there and get it clear anyway moving on if you already know talk with an adult you trust like a parent or a school counselor I wouldn't talk to a school counselor that person can connect you with a specially trained Doctor Who can help you and your family decide what's best for your body at first you and the doctor might talk about wearing the clothes and using the pronouns like he she or they even make you feel like the most true you if you haven't gone through puberty yet the doctor might offer medicine to delay your body's changes giving you more time to think about your gender identity I oh God every time I hear or see something where a medical professional or some kind of activist is telling kids oh you could just you can just delay puberty so you can think about it like if you were listening to music you put the pause on and then they think that this is a great alternative for our argument that children's brains are not developed enough so they need to wait to make that decision you cannot reverse puberty blockers I do not care what people say you cannot go back if you are stunting the growth of this and that and everything you can't just go back and make them grow in like a month this is not some like putting a pause on anything this is a lie eight-year-olds are reading this book and learning this like quote fake news if I want to use that word if you've already gone through puberty a doctor can still help studies show that transgender and non-binary kids who get help from doctors have much better mental health than those who don't that's arguable the stats are not confirmed anyway if you do not have an adult that you trust their organizations across the country that can help you turn to the resources on page 95 for more information so you can go around your parents American Girls Just Gonna teach kids how to contact other people about their gender identity okay and then they have a quote from Jazz Jennings saying being transgender isn't a medical transition it is a process of learning to love yourself for who you are no it is literally Medical God and then they go on if you're transgender or non-binary loving your body might feel a bit different than it does for a cisgender person parts of your body might make you feel uncomfortable and you want to change the way you look that's totally okay you can appreciate your body for everything it allows you to experience and still want to change certain things about it when you're feeling out of place in your body do things that make your body feel more at home like dressing in your favorite clothes and doing something you love they go on I'm like out of breath because I'm thinking of the age that I was when I was reading these books and if you go on Amazon and you read the reviews of parents who have bought this book and it's kind of up and down on the reviews what they think these are all parents of like I said seven eight nine ten-year-olds hearing that doctors can go and you know totally change their bodies hearing from Jazz Jennings Jazz Jennings is on record as the first transgender kid there was a whole like TLC show about him he is now my age and still dealing with the horrific consequences of experimental medicine that was done to him at 13 14 15 years old I mean Jazz was literally chopped up jazz is on record saying I have no sex drive the vagina that they gave me it does not work it is an open wound it got infected they did multiple reconstruction surgeries Jazz has now had over three surgeries to try to correct everything that was done to them as a child Jazz has gained over 100 pounds away binge eating disorder and the side effects or medications that jazz has to take every single day to keep things in check this is not somebody or a situation that young girls should idolize and look up to his role model I obviously feel so much empathy for jazz and everything that occurred in Jazz's life and what their parents allowed them to do but this is not a life that children should look up to and want to endure that is the worst possible person to put on that page anyway FOX also covered some of the other topics that were featured the transgender one with all the medical stuff that was the most appalling to me but I think it's also important just to show some of the other things according to Fox one section labeled body image and distress discusses body dysmorphia as a mental health condition that takes over the lives and causes them to be obsessed over an aspect of their body they dislike which can be serious and it doesn't go away on its own another section labeled making space for everyone asks readers to think about the last time they used a public restroom followed up with questions such as was it easy to find when you felt comfortable using could you use it easily did you feel safe how would your day have changed if using the bathroom meant going all the way home and then the book concludes with a list of resources on gender inclusive schools anti-racism and diverse books which includes organizations like the Trevor Project glsen and we need diverse books and then in this article if you guys want to read that there are a few d-transitioners and activists that work to protect children that are giving their thoughts on it and what would have helped them as a young person all of that is just a great article if you're interested in it but anyway back to the broader issue here if American girl had simply published a book about the underlying issues of all of this of young women and young girls feeling peer pressure of wanting to look a certain way of wanting to follow trends of feeling like they're too skinny they're too fat I mean the beginnings of puberty are a terrible time for everyone everybody's body looks different we obviously feel uncomfortable in our skins that's very normal and that would have been great if they had just written a book about that that parents could use to teach their daughters to talk with them but no they're encouraging girls to think about transgenderism that if they feel uncomfortable In Their Skin it might be because they're non-binary or they're a boy at nine years old they're teaching them how to have conversations with their parents or circumvent them and talk to organizations that can help them get them in front of a doctor now like I said there are a ton of reviews on Amazon from parents they're kind of all over the place but I think that this one parent hit the nail on the head with one Point here we have been relying on the American Girls Smart Girls guide book for years I think you probably have all of them they are engaging and informative they frequently spell out what all girls should know and ASD girls in particular have a hard time picking up they are absolutely golden especially for girls on the Spectrum but as I skimmed this book I had some rail reservations the bottom line is that this book is best for girls who are already having some body image issues because if they start reading without having any they will likely acquire some along the way body positivity is obviously important and a few pages are devoted to topics such as skin color and disability if she is saying the silent part out loud here they will likely acquire some along the way if your kids are not already dealing with this why would you put a book in front of them that might make them feel like they're crazy or that something is wrong with them or that people might view them in a different way because they wear baggy clothes or oh I I like doing guy things This Book Is Telling Me Maybe I'm transgender they don't need to know that do not encourage your kids to have these concerns about themselves if they are not already bringing them to you and if your kids do come to you with concerns and struggles as they should good then you can learn how to address that together and then find resources together that are age appropriate don't just let them skim this American Girl doll book think that they're transgender and then start calling up a doctor to help go around you and get on some puberty blockers it's just ridiculous okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "IKqVwz1udwc": "this is part two of learning about a air airs Neo pronouns a is from Baltimore originally then a moved to New York City for a few years now a lives in LA with air two cats have you seen air artwork yet a nose that learning new words is difficult already let alone how hard it is to unlearn how we operate and how we think about ourselves and those around us but a is so grateful you stayed so long to practice with air and a hopes you come back for more pronoun lessons what is this some like reimagine disney-esque PBS Kids special I say that but then you like log on to YouTube kids and you see videos about pronouns so that's really not that out of the ordinary this is just weird I don't want to live on this planet anymore somebody said the history and origin of these pronouns is that you made them up two seconds ago so you could make a tick tock yeah literally they probably dated back to a month ago when Urban Dictionary put them up as a joke and somebody ran with it I missed some people had personalities instead of whatever this is mental illness", "oiXXWuzXYyk": "welcome back y'all welcome to another stream this is a big day number one we're playing a game that i've wanted to play for a while because it was trending i mean i was seeing it on tick tock everywhere you can tell we have a different angle today we have switched up some of the studio i removed my big desktop you're seeing me from this side and that is because producer sheller is here next to me this is him this is sheller who you guys hear the um ominous voice this look you're doing he's like awesome whatever um i convinced him to come on screen and hang out with me to play this game so you guys are finally seeing him in the flesh in person not just an ominous voice this is who uh makes sure that i stay on track every day during the show um making sure i don't say bad things yes correcting my sailor's math mouth yes um and then keeps this whole show running basically and usually is back here monitoring the live stream and that but bobby is in the studio as well today so he is back there hello bobby what's up bobby there he is we got all the guys here anyway okay so we are going to play let me just see what's happening here first and then we're going to get into the game um hello leon how are you remember to stay hydrated during this oppressive heat wave okay actually that's very i appreciate that i do need people to remind me to stay hydrated especially right now because of the sunburn i keep talking about it but it really is making an impact because my nose is peeling now i think it's fine right now but like this morning i woke up and i could like see little pieces of skin and stuff yeah i totally noticed that this morning god he's so good for my self-confidence um let's see uh chemical imbalance oh okay so hey what is your take on the new guardian article about chemical imbalance is a myth daily wire such a positive impact in my life so happy to hear that an awesome person you are an awesome person um i thought it was a fantastic article and i have not done a ton of research about the chemical imbalances and all of that stuff but i will say that just from my life and my experiences my family's experiences i have never seen personally depression as a chemical imbalance but it has always been as the result of childhood trauma you know addiction that sort of thing it is always you know the result of something else maybe that's not the case for other people but i think it is it's definitely stirring people up yeah in a way in a good way and i think that it will force people to if they actually take it seriously to start addressing depression not just as you know the full condition but as okay this is the symptom of something else let's actually get to the root of the issue and not just slap some antidepressants on it because they are awful for you because this is like circulating the news right now it resurfaced an old clip of um tom cruise from like 2006 or something have you seen that or he's like talking about uh you know psychiatry and yeah and how he thinks it's bs and what they're doing to kids yeah the same thing with like the add and adhd meds where it's like they'll the amount of young men that are put on add medication at i think the like the peak is like 10 or 12. yeah it's like oh yep you are you can't sit still in class let's just slap these on you it's like no maybe he's just a 12 year old boy that needs to be running outside so i just think it is all in all it is a good way to start the conversation about addressing you know the roots of the issues um let's see okay let's go ahead and get into it oh my goodness i'll go back here let's see paul says hey right you're the true hero that chris evans only thinks he is that's dope that's fun that's good for my ego um all hail lord sheller yes exactly what's up guys hello all right let's do it okay so we are going to play do you want to explain how to play this game because you okay so i'm terrible at games um and i don't really play too many games we don't even this is just asking each other questions yeah yeah yeah yeah so that being said this scene's pretty straightforward and pretty simple but i guess what happens is there are three levels and you and i are going to ask each other seven questions each per level okay and i guess uh this is what we're playing each level gets more and more personal as we progress through the game um and uh if i say something that you feel like i'm sort of bsing you or i need to like go in depth yes so the levels are perception how well uh do you know how others see you level one is gaining perspective on what first impressions we give off and then there's connection and reflection so sheller's first time on camera i'm forcing him to expose his deepest darkest feelings and emotions yeah i'm excited for some kind of headline tomorrow that's like far right extremist producer what was that that you said crosstalk eyes on camera there's gonna be a thumbnail of me going like i can see it already all right here we go okay okay let's start it oh wait we have to do it oh yeah yes this is the real thing the way you decide who goes first is we have to have a staring contest and whoever blinks first um is the loser and they go second okay all right so bobby can you count us down did you say barbecue i said bobby bobby barbecue i'm calling you bbq um ready three two one okay all right okay all right okay so i guess i asked you the first question then okay are you ready yeah okay here we go do i seem like a morning person or a night owl night owl why the card asks that question oh i was like um because i see you in the mornings and you don't look when we're shooting the show at 8 a.m um no because i think it's just because i know you and i know that you like work late and you prefer being up watching movies late and that kind of thing when i'm working i do my best work at night okay somebody said it looks like you listened to my idea of putting your producer on camera p.s he loves your dog we know that he does he does yeah i love that thing thing oh oh this is a wild card oh sometimes there's wild cards in the deck i don't know okay grab your pencil oh you have it okay write down something others would never guess about you just by looking at you both players can bear oh oh this is hard um what i don't know oh could we just talk out loud about instead of writing it down i guess we could yeah most people i feel like it's my age you know what me too really that is yeah yes sheller's actually elderly i'm the old guy in the in the office certainly our department yeah sure but yeah uh people are usually surprised at how old i am people are usually surprised at how young i am there we go okay okay that's fine all right moving on okay okay let's see uh first impression seeing sheller for the first time they think that you could beat a hundred vegans in a fight let's see first impression of seeing shelley for the first time i would bet a million dollar seller could beat a hundred vegans in a fight yeah that's a fair assessment there you go that's good all right you asked me now okay here we go okay oh i got a wild card no ask and answer the next question in a different accent okay so then i have to do it um do i yeah so then i both of us have to do it actually okay so what did my shoes tell you about me was that an accent oh i forgot i forgot um damn it you wish i got this question oh yeah i do yeah we have a lot of issues with the sheller shoes not issues i just have conflicting feelings about them because sometimes he looks like a 45 year old dad and other days he looks like a 19 year old one pair of shoes okay they're so ugly look it's just the one though yeah the rest of my shoes are awesome how do you guys feel about a video i'm going off i will be back on this in a minute how do you feel about a video an off the clock video where i take sheller and my other producer kobe you guys saw him in the libra episode out to the mall and we do a makeover i don't know what i was expecting i always expect people to like actually respond anyway let's do it oh no you're getting do what people were saying about you ah what i'm not going to read it out loud look at that dang are you happy with the this is an ego boost for sheller okay let me do my accent now don't distract me anymore um how do i it's so hard for me to get into accents i can only so i can do my turn right now okay and then all i need to think about so you want me to do mine yes all right the only accent i can do properly is russian so we're going with russian do you think i've ever been fired from job if so what for uh yeah you probably have for like like pushing back or something like that like like i don't know i feel like you probably he so he was a substitute teacher at one point i feel like you could have been like fired for being a son because you were like shut the f up kids or punching them yeah okay we don't condone violence on this channel let's not take it that far no i've actually never been fired from a job yeah i have been but that being said uh i did work at this motorcycle shop when i was like in the early 2000s and which is weird i've never ridden a motorcycle before i didn't know this about you anyways when i was there my boss who i got along with really well but he always would say he'd always tell me to do things and i'd be like why uh-huh why and he'd say you know what never join the army sheller because you can't ask why yeah so yeah that makes sense but i didn't get fired though well you skated through i got fired um i was hired to be on the show mom with um oh crap on a ferris wheel and uh god who's when she's on west wing why am i blinking out the super tall one jenny yes yeah and it wasn't it's like weird because i think when you're acting you obviously get fired for you know being a terrible employee or whatever right but i was hired and then i did three days of shooting and they the storyline wasn't working or something they re they went in and they rewrote the entire episode and they completely changed my character and so my character went from being like a 16 year old athletic tomboy whatever whatever to being like a 13 year old short chubby gamer girl and so i went in the next day to shoot and they were like hey we're gonna redo all this we rewrote it and i was like this doesn't seem like me five eight like i would think of 17 at the time this doesn't seem like my character and uh yeah and then i was walking out to my trailer like around lunchtime and my manager called me and said hey so you they're going to recast it just because it works better if the character is younger and i was like all right so anyway that's one time so do you feel like if you never spoke up then you would have still been on or do you think that did you get fired because you saying that was like rebelling against them or was it i didn't say anything oh okay yeah that was just like i they said that oh okay okay okay i'm sorry i thought that you you had said that no no no no in my head i was like oh this is super weird like we did an entire day of filming trying to like cram me into that character basically and do the new lines yeah um somebody said you said that you liked romantic comedies during a certain time of the month with these class be classified as period pieces actually that's actually very funny yes you only thought you were older because you have the life experience of a 50 year old that's accurate james that's accurate benchmark looking authentic with that makeup um who said oh do i look like i thought for some reason cause chloe chloe grace moretz is blonde i thought you were saying that about sheller and i was like really shallow looks like chloe guys moretz okay uh is that the man that hates dogs i mean my best friend no he doesn't hate dogs he hates my dog and he hates small dogs that you can't he doesn't believe that dogs that you can drop kick if you if you're if they can be classified as rats then i don't like it at all all right um comfort over style shell or out of boy i need to do my accent thank you thank you um i need to get into it i can do my appalachian accent i just have to say a few buzzwords to get into it so i'm from chattanooga tanner c you can go down to the walmart and you can get yourself buggy and then you can go get some fried chicken down at champions so sheller what what do my shoes tell you about me um so i'm a guy i i don't notice shoes but um those shoes say look at me i'm brett cooper i'm laid back and i'm cool wow cool i'm am i laying back and cool yeah man that's what we're going with that's a lie i'm hyper and not cool at all all right is it my it's your turn now okay we did the accents all right no more accents no more please no okay do you think i intimidate others why or why not yes again because of the like no you just kind of are like why why you don't really care and before you get to know you you don't come off as cold but it's just you don't really care i thought i got to know you very well at first because we were doing those videos with sam uh-huh and you were you were very nice to me before i started doing comment section we were doing like editorial videos together and you were always like funny and so and but then if i would just see you at your desk i would have been like oh that guy's like really intense like a scary editor over there with his big pcs and the chaos that's your desk um his desk is very messy i'm exposing you yes it is um somebody says i can't decide if sheller looks more like aaron eckhart or carlton heston charlton heston yeah um i've gotten the aaron eckhart before like back and like if when i was like in super good shape um then a lot of people said that out quickly when you still went to the gym when i still went to the chat um oh god is that putin sitting next to you what so james says you look james crawford says you look like putin oh wow um let's see this is all for the crew awesome work thanks so much appreciate it they are awesome he would have loved my 20 pound cavapoo he was the best dog he sounds like the greatest dog don't say anything brett's shoes say i love the sand lot that's actually yeah that's good it's great movie it is okay your turn oh we've only done two of these haven't we yeah it's your turn oh we know hey it's your turn you have to appreciate that we did it in reverse okay what fast food restaurant do you think i'm most likely to drive through and what's my order oh that's good um let me see i'm very ethnocentric when it comes to food i can't really see like what others enjoy outside of what i like yeah um let me think um i would say it's pretty standard but i think that you're chick-fil-a yeah yeah well here these days would be chick-fil-a or but back in l.a i was basic and i did actually really like in and out okay well yeah i don't think that in california than it would be i don't think in and out is the greatest burger of all time but the fact that it's on every corner and it's good it's good and it's also fairly priced yes and you can get it at any time of day yeah there's there's like the war between in and out and five guys yeah and five guys is good fantastic don't get me wrong but they're also so expensive and they also don't have drive-throughs they don't have drive-throughs what they got what does my order a chick-fil-a you order a chick-fil-a i see that she said do you get the fried or do you get the grilled i'm gonna see you get the fried okay i'm not a health brat yeah so thank you yeah fried spicy there you go okay all right here you go i also like bojangles i've never been oh heathen i know uh okay do i remind you of anyone um my older brother okay while we get along when i did that um video of the grand old memes my brother emailed me well he first texted me and he said oh my god i love your producer i think we would be best friends because those are all my favorite memes too they're closer in age that my brother's 14 years older than me so they're closer in age um and then he sent an email with all these links to other memes and shows that he probably would have known as a way to virtually connect with shellers i knew like 75 of them yeah but they would get along they have the same personality basically um somebody says i agree rat terriers are pointless somebody says what is sheller's bench pr it's been a while and i didn't ever really bench too much i used to just do um uh flies and uh you know uh dumbbell presses i'm just going to become a sports show would you rather bra do you even lifts bro do you even listen you don't anymore [Laughter] see this is the kind this is the kind of crap that i get on a daily basis because you use me crap first listen it's all about staying humble here it actually does a good job because you know it's important as an audience grows i never want to get too big for my britches i don't think i will because i feel like i have a good head on my shoulders and he my brother and my mother if i did so slap me whoop my ass yeah all right here we go um i miss in and outs i lived in oceanside for three years i love oceanside ah that's sick very cool that's where i learned to surf um sheller bojangles cajun chicken biscuit with an egg and pimento cheese you can thank me later hell yeah all right i will try it all right go ahead oh wait no it's my turn yes think of a wild card think of your favorite tv show of all time on the count of three say it out loud are we saying our favorite childhood tv show or whatever it's a childhood tv show yeah i think it's each of ours all right one two three it's underneath thundercats what's that thundercats thundercats no i don't care they actually uh like redid another thundercats couple years ago and they totally sjwed it and they like made the animation look like but i guess i repeat myself um yeah ruined it ruined my childhood let's see oh somebody says loving sheller's proper headphones right guys from the very beginning my headphones look sick from the very beginning i spoke up before before i was producer on the show i was like the headphones somebody else was producing it yeah there was gracie who built this set and she was working with me on it and she moved on to a different project and so sheller got stuck on this with me stuck oh he doesn't want to be here okay um that's not true he loves this uh north carolina native here but jango's for life can go ahead we need brett to collab with her alter ego ben hopefully soon he'll be back in nashville soon yeah good okay he's getting a lot of wild cards we're not going through this entire stack by the way we just do seven each yeah yeah so all right here we go thanks for sticking with that do i look kind of explain it's kind of piggybacks on on the last one again yes yeah if you were just sitting at your desk angrily editing something i would be scared of you not as scared just intimidated i wouldn't i wouldn't necessarily come up to talk to you now that i know you yeah so i when i'm editing i've got like when you're in like work mode i've got like a grimace yes gotcha resting grimace face gotcha hairy eyeballs my mom calls it oh who do you think my celebrity crushes i'm trying to think of all the other noodlemen that we've uh that you secretly don't no i actually don't know who mine is maybe he'll give me some inspiration okay uh this is like so cliche and stupid and maybe even out of your your age bracket but i'm going to say zac efron but when he was high school musical yeah you know who my first crush was like on a tv show or whatever uh the boy who played peter pan in the live action peter pan oh yeah oh so cute yeah what's that kid's name when i was like eight years old he's in that movie he's in that movie frailty with uh bill paxton which is a great movie super underrated but he's a little kid in that movie and he's he was good so i know what you're talking about okay young leonardo dicaprio what how did i just say that leonardo leonardo dicaprio is always a classic oh wait your turn no no it's your turn oh is sheller a zyzz prodigy certified good rancher i don't know what that means i'm a certified good rancher good ranchers is good though use my promo code yes for free shipping and 30 off um okay i live in a house of strong feminist libs any tips bro i'm sorry um move out if you can no but depends like how old you are it depends on a lot of factors but also like it's very hard if you're overpowered by like how many people are there but if it's family that's kind of difficult because you have to gauge you know how many fights you want to be in if you want to burn bridges sometimes it's better just to you know you can you can respectfully say like i would not like to have these conversations because i don't think it's going to be good for our relationship yeah and just try to keep it apolitical but it's very hard when those people like they live and breathe their social justice warrior whatever yeah and so sometimes i don't know you just got to set those boundaries i guess yeah which is not fun boundary setting is hard have i ever visited london yes i have have you ever uh for like a night or two let's see okay you should play straight seems like a game you would really enjoy not being sarcastic and celebrity crush of brett's is clearly gina chrono well yeah she's my sister i can't have a crush on my sister um okay oh wait your turn no i asked i asked the dude do i look kind no i then i asked oh yeah yeah yeah we're talking about my crush i feel like your celebrity crush is like margo robbie i feel like that's every guy's oh no that's that's austin's i mean gracie's awesome i'm not going to say no yeah that's true but no no it's not all time all time's katepacking sale let's supposed to clear it up here okay bobby's like hell yeah this is like this is too similar this is what was your first impression oh yeah we'll get it yeah yeah i'll do another one we already know that i thought he was mean just kidding on a scale of one to ten i've been in your car i know what this answer is how messy do you think my car is what being clean is 10 being a complete disaster like five plane okay wow but i mean the day that i was in it that's a lower number than i would give my own really yeah my whole car my car is like disgusting well it wasn't cluttered i didn't you know take a a deep look at you know the crevices and like what kind of food does he have stashed in here but it was not super cluttered you had like a few things in the back that you threw into the trunk so that we could all fit in there i wouldn't say that's too messy but you have not seen mine okay actually have you no you didn't go to that shoot it's fine it just has dog hair and water bottles yes for sure and [Music] boots and they have a pair of cowboy boots in there right now a jacket usually a hat dog things oh i always carry a jug of water and dog food and gave them anywhere with my dogs and i usually have one of my freeze-dried food kits as well because you never know if you're gonna get stranded somewhere gotta always have you know be prepared stay strapped also that all right oh my turn yes um what about me and freeze you um well you're you're very young but you're like super intelligent like you you are a very very smart person and and um i don't know that's like lame but i guess that's what's most intriguing is just how smart you are i hate saying it wow oh my god he's so nice to me somebody said they sent a super chat earlier and i was supposed to read it oh uh have you guys been following liv golf at all i've been trying i've been to the players in pontaverta at liv it looks light years better i have no idea what that is jane neither do i i'm not a big golf person same sorry if i play i kick up grass and watching it it's like at the same level as baseball for me this is going to cause problems but i think baseball's very boring i only go for the hot dogs and the pretzels i'm just saying let's see um oh thank you so much how do you pronounce your name talia i'm gonna say talia maybe thank you so much that's very very sweet um ooh okay brett celebrity crush is johnny depp yep you're not terribly wrong um okay what is your music taste they're asking me yeah oh the music question um i i listen to you like scores yeah orchestrated i listen to films i listen to film scores i'm a i'm an avid collector oh yeah um okay let's see childhood show spongebob fun fact i've never seen any spongebob same wow oh yeah i forgot you're also a freak uh let's see love from canada help get rid of our prime minister blackface [Laughter] well work on it don't worry matt sent in some money for the headphones fun thank you i yeah uh apparently need it brett everyone wants you to stream skyrim i i will have to add it to the list i can do skyrim and um you see the should i do call of duty or should i do what's the other one i would love to see that see the problem the problem with a lot of these games is so she's she's on a pc now and which is great but the pc that we have kind of sucks and it can't play it can't you just build i would love to um but you know that's where the super chat is going she gotta get her approved but yes we can build a gaming pc 100 all right let's see okay uh i'm trying to make sure we miss all right pull out another one okay is it my turn it's my turn somebody said you aren't if you aren't fat please put down the diet dr pepper we only have diet in the fridge right now and i wanted something fizzy um okay i don't know what does my phone wallpaper tell you about me god you're such a nerd it's uh it's a drawing of batman where's your wife where is she she understands she have like catwoman on hers she should my god okay um let's see gaming pc fun thanks matt appreciate it stream skyrim after you've leveled up a bit get to know the game some i don't know what that means but okay oh this is our last one i think oh no that's level two oopsie how many do we have between us one two three four move on i think we're this will be the last one on level okay do i seem like more of a creative or an analytical type analytical yep you should even take a breath yeah you're right 100 about the numbers i am all i'm all about the numbers yeah all right i'm actually not about numbers i hate math but i am analytical in that well it's kind of hard i'm not like artsy fartsy creative but i do feel like i'm not bogged down by no i think that you're but i think logically so like okay so since you're since you're an actress right there are two different kinds of actresses or there's just two different kinds of actors there are the actors where you can be like okay here's where the scene is going to be this is what you're going to do and then they'll be like well what what do i what am i supposed to be feeling right now i don't understand what that means and then you gotta sit there and explain to them what they're how they're supposed to be feeling yes and then there's the other other actor which is like where am i here okay what are you saying great that's you that's yeah that is true yeah i want to be told what mark i'm hitting yes am i changing any lines yes what's my angle and where is the person that i'm speaking to yeah and then i should be able to because it's my job i should be able to figure out the rest of it one that's exactly right that's that's if there is like a very complicated scene that it's like okay we want to try it a few different ways but just going in and being like so like what do i do i'm like that's your job figure it out yes and there should be discussions obviously but those happen beforehand before you shoot normally yeah and anyways yes so that's definitely how you are yeah um have you been following sd comic con and has any new show or trailer caught your eyes i have not been following comic-con i've never been to a comic-con have you uh yes i don't even know why i haven't been since like 2007 though it's been a long time 2007 was so long ago i know i was like five [Laughter] oh dear lord okay go ahead uh new shows caught my eye though um or i won what so do you see that they them har slasher is that the one with kevin bacon i don't know but it's the one about a conversion therapy yeah it's kevin bacon's in that or whatever i'm going to watch it and react to it yeah it looks it looks like trash and speaking of things that look like trash uh the new uh lord of the rings on amazon looks like hot garbage and so you flashed that in one of the episodes you just popped it up yes that and uh what else oh the new halloween movie looks like trash too all right so on to the next this level two is connection right oh yeah are you ready to go down the uh the emotional rabbit hole oh god i stopped going to therapy two years ago why am i back in it now uh let's see look up ryan upchurch his music is fire i shall more gaming money for skyrim we all were on it wanted thanks logan appreciate it super important question pineapple on pizza yes or no yes no i mean like i don't require it but if it's there yeah it's cool i don't i'm not one of those people that's like oh this is so weird why would you do it like that's odd it's the pineapple it's the cheese and the pineapple for some reason it's the textures and they weirded me out but i'm not against odd things on pizza like my very favorite pizza in the world actually whoever said that they were in oceanside um this place is in oceanside crap what is it called pandora's pizza they um they're macaroni and cheese pizza fire that sounds really good made it a couple months ago and it was awesome anyway so i'm not against weird pizzas i just it the texture works me out i'm also the kind of person where if i didn't eat pizza for the rest of my life i would be okay so you know being in nashville we have a lot of pizza places that have like hot chicken pizza that's good yeah okay let's see uh brett can i please teach you how to ride a bike i'm very sorry i will be learning but these two are going to be the ones teaching and we are going to do a video most likely yes with like obstacle courses for me i think my my idea i just need to pay for it basically i need to get it approved i want to go to brandon falls which i talked about in my latest episode where biden fell off of his bike and i want to go right there and show that i can ride a bike better than biden bobby has his head in his hands right now because i feel like he thinks that i'm going to fall naturally probably all right ready okay here we go more emotional questions i hate emotions um what do you crave more of ice cream [Laughter] okay that's your answer no um yeah it is guys oh here's the thing we have an ice cream machine at the office we have an ice cream machine this is fake news what's about to happen this man gets a bowl like this big fake news so we have little like yogurt cups basically for our ice cream machine you could get like a soup bowl a soup bowl and filled it up all the way and just put this just vanilla with sprinkles literally a child it's fake news yep um anyway i have never felt so much shame uh i don't know what i crave more of uh [Music] time with my family maybe because i don't live near any of them anymore dig deeper oh i don't know that's kind of bs um no definitely like i miss not living as close to my mom that's upsetting um what do i i don't know um you know one thing i will say i've gotten more comfortable with it late like now i guess but teen years and like middle school to high school i guess i i can't really say years because my age was all over the place when it came to like those grades so i can't really do that but middle in high school i i've never still to this day have never been able to like really hang on to friends i was more of a floater in a way and that always made me really sad and i always craved like long time friendships that's i guess that's one i always wanted to have like i grew up with this person i've known them i always hoped i would meet people it's like okay we're 13. we're gonna like be in our 20s together through all that stuff and it's never it's never really been lasting but i also think it's because one i moved around a lot and i was friends with a lot of actors flaky but it is very difficult when everybody in your life is also like a has like a professional child basically yeah so i would have friends and then they would move for like six months out of the year to canada to shoot a tv show i we would hang out for a week when they would be back and then i would go to north carolina and be shooting something or i was just like it just wasn't the most stable environment which was fine and it made me very i guess resilient and adaptable to other social situations but i think that was always something that i wanted was like a long-term friendship i'll be your long-term friend he's never going to stop producing my show he's going to be like geriatric and stuff like three years from now anyway that's all okay somebody says i crave more common sense in this administration yes all right here we go let's have this is exciting i can't wait for sheller to get emotional oh gosh can you cry no let's see um hold on crying's for the libs i need to catch up on things after i just became emotional what does benchmark smell like uh i i don't know normal i don't i don't like stand next to him and go i'm not fighting guys yeah we're not biting i don't know ask go on his live and he can ask him about his whatever um i don't know about pizza but are you worried about your data not being secured you can go get expressvpn listen you don't have to use code ben anymore because i have my own code you can use codecooper for three months free expressvpn guys get protected let's see you need to learn to walk before you can run so before you can ride a bike on two wheels you need to learn how to ride a unicycle that would actually be fun let's do that at the end of the video once i learn how to ride a bike well i guess they're saying i need to do it first let's see question for both of you do you believe that toxic masculinity is a thing no no i believe that there are men yeah there but they're also women people can be dicks regardless of their gender but i don't think that it should be generalized yeah that is anything anytime there's the word toxic in front of something it's stupid made up ridiculous i even see people on the right using the word sometimes and it's really annoying don't use that word yeah that's that's a that's a word that they use uh femme shapiro funds for the biden falls trip thank you seeker i crave some more common sense oh yeah i read that one yep um brett was a floater someone time stamp and clip it what does that mean did i say something that people are gonna now run with putting yourself out there man oh why is bobby's smiling and nodding at me you people i meant that i'm not even going to try to explain this i'm being attacked all right yo when you're asked how are you how often do you answer truthfully um [Music] does anyone ever ask uh answer that truthfully um no i don't know um how are you i mean i feel like if i'm not doing well i'm still not i'm probably not gonna err my bs to someone else yeah so for the most part if i'm like yeah i'm doing i'm doing good then i'm probably telling the truth but yeah uh am i ever gonna say that oh actually i'm having a good day it's very rare that i yeah i'm probably not gonna do that and i won't say if it's just like a quick like oh how are you i'm never gonna be like oh let me tell you about all my problems i think a good indicator for me like oh i'm doing fine i don't know i'm doing well or good that's neutral for me yeah doing great that's actually being pretty honest if i say i'm doing fine that's probably an indicator yeah that i'm stressed about something or that it's not great i'm like oh i'm fine yeah it's the whole classic girl thing of like i'm fine everything's fine everything was not true all right go ahead okay is this the crusty white dog stream no not yet i'll bring her in at some point i'm gonna torment sheller i'm worried that she'll be killed though so it's a it's a bit of a liability on my part okay uh what are you still trying to prove to yourself to myself oh yes um oh i guess that i won't fall into the same patterns as many people in my family i don't think i'm there yet just because i'm not old enough i haven't had the same life experience but i do i remember somebody told me when i was younger or i think they told my mom this but they were like brett is going to be the one who like breaks the cycle or whatever uh-huh so i'm still waiting on i think i have thus far so far so good yeah so probably that but that's just like a long-term goal that's good yeah that's a good answer all right let's see does brett's like ever get tired of sitting that way it depends on the pants i'm wearing if they're super tight then yes and it kind of hurts these some sick made well cargo pants nice and flexible nice there we go all right have you changed your mind about anything recently um liking my dog no absolutely not um this is like super lame but the only thing i can think of is i changed my mind about the original top gun i certainly not like that movie and before i saw the uh the new one i watched the first one and i was like you know what this is actually it's not bad i i remembered it oh yeah bobby's happy bobby's stoked hell yeah we win yeah it's a fantastic movie bobby's definitely in the top gun one over two camp i'm not there but topkin it's a great movie it's good it's fantastic that's super lame i'm sorry but that's all i got let's see somebody said uh brett you're not wrong about baseball the ratings have gone down in the last 10 years and the game was the lowest rated ever yeah uh hebrew have you ever met benjamin or plan on meeting him yes i have many times he's in florida but he comes into nashville pretty often let's see um have you heard the new warren zeters song i have not i don't know who that is all right i am the last person that music okay um what has been oh yeah what has been your earliest recollection of happiness like my earliest memory yeah of happiness like the oh um okay probably one of my earliest memories ever is my dad my dad used to work for the north face he worked in their finance department and so we have so much north face gear big outdoorsy family when we lived in washington and he had this big north face like child backpacking thing what is it called um it was a backpack that had like a child seat on the top of it so i would sit on his head he was very very my dad is very curly hair and so i remember holding on to his hair and we would go wild blackberry picking because we lived on a big farm on this island in washington and there was a lot of like nature preserves and that kind of stuff we would go wild back blackberry picking that one and then probably this is not like a recollection of happiness but i think because this was such a there was so much going on i remember it it was when my brother set me on fire but the memory before that was very happy because it was swinging where it was fourth of july i was in my baby swing i had a swing attached to the tree outside of my childhood like my nursery wait he set you on fire all three of them so what'd you do screamed and then my mom yelled at them no what did you do to make them set you on fire oh i wasn't asking for it i was an adorable little toddler in a ruffled dress and they handed me a sparkler oh and they were like here hold it it'll be so much fun i see kind of an accident then yeah gotcha let's see a foot kicking a rock and the rock bouncing off the big la tanks booty on a t-shirt hat this is it wow you should make that i would buy it yeah if you ever grow out of your if you ever grow out of your republican phase can i recommend a book by a guy named karl marx decent read i'm actually not really a republican oh my god the revelations no i don't think that i'm like stereotypical gop i always say that i'm more libertarian same but i don't like the lp that's the thing the libertarian party is a hot mess yeah but i also think that the gop is a hot mess massive hot mess yeah a lot of uh corruption yeah elite bs a lot of super betas grifters yeah i mean the same for the democrats they're all just older and probably richer with all of their insider trading um let's see what is this ten minutes ago brett said in high school i was kind of a whatever phrase it weird beware of trolls i'm a be lover not a b hater yeah i was told i don't know what that means or what i said and they can explain it to me off camera but i probably just pushed myself to a corner so what are you going to do yeah well it's the internet so it's out there i guess all right on to the next okay is it i don't know whose turn it is i think it's oh yeah it's your turn if you ask me something no i just asked you the happiness question but then you asked oh no i'm sorry we're going to wear this up how are you really i'm great good wow that's so honest of you no i'm i'm great i'm good that's good you're having fun yeah i am i'm having a lot of fun actually so things were um a little hectic for a while but i feel like things have like kind of settled down and hit their stride so in my life that's good and it's good i love tennessee i love nashville i'm very glad he was in l.a i was yes i was from the uh los angeles uh daily wire team and moved out here with the company so good decision yep i'm happy yeah love it all right good well that's nice that was awesome look at that being emotional all right should we do one more and we can move on to level three so we have time all right so all right somebody said chicken nugget and ham what is your go-to dip ranch barbecue sauce i am a barbecue sauce you had to give up barbecue sauce a ranch probably i love them both but i would give up ranch i would give a barbecue sauce okay okay um they're saying shell or speak up to you to projection oh i'm sorry oh yeah all right i will try to speak up more yep um finish the sentences strangers would describe me as blank only i know that i am blank uh strangers would describe uh oh that's hard ah this is like i'm not really good at yeah it sounds so lame but i'm not good at talking about myself so i never think about yeah questions like this i'm trying to i mean it's semi-easy because i feel like there's a perception of me that's like online brett like comment section and then i'm trying to think about there's if there's any differences and like things that i keep more private or that you guys might not know about me but i feel like i'm pretty transparent um yeah i would say so your personality i mean of course you're not gonna air out everything every arrow and everything but that is there anything okay from your perspective is there anything that like you know that other people might not know no no i don't think so i'm no um what you see is what you get guys yeah it is yeah actually i don't this is hard yeah um somebody said is she married to him i didn't even get my shot no he is married though um i don't we're moving on can i show you a different one yeah yeah oh wild card create a secret handshake is that it there we go wow okay so okay ready yeah and then you know what you know what this will do we'll we'll go boom boom boom boom and then we'll do the the predator um what's that uh would they go like this and that's it i'm so strong guys you see those noodle arms right it was on all access a couple of months ago and somebody was like we always ask ben to flex but you have noodle arms i was like well flex anyway all righty should we do it all right let's do level three now yes thanks for sticking with us this is actually very entertaining somebody said do you think trump or desantis will be the nominee for the republican party i would love to see trump as president desantis as vp um i really don't know yeah it's honestly a toss-up because i feel like the republican party is very divided over whether they would like trump or sanders i like trump i would prefer if he keep doing what he's doing and that desantis would run i just think desantis is younger i'm just i'm very tired of old people in politics i will say yeah yeah plus desantis is like he's like trump but without the trump baggage yep so i don't know i'm sort of to sanchez team desantis okay level three this is so weird oh no i don't want to do this one oh no you're skipping it okay i won't do it i won't do it i mean if it's if it's that bad no it's not it's just like that would make you feel closer to me [Laughter] more more time spent together than we already do oh i have one yeah let's hear it we need to you mean bobby we have to have movie nights to watch star wars and things because i haven't seen them yeah do you guys think that would be a good live or or a good video i don't know i'm still trying to like figure out how logistically the best way of doing it would be because i know because everybody on my reddit page that you guys started people are constantly talking about star wars like when is she gonna rewatch star wars actually you know yeah and sheller apparently has like og og versions that he wants me to see and then bobby seconded that and so then it became a plan to go watch these things we haven't actually done it yes the original trilogies uh the original trilogy uh untampered with zero george lucas cg finagling yeah yeah so we should do that at some point okay all right there's that all right go ahead okay here we go but we're really connecting what can we create together this show yeah more videos more videos just for you guys how do our personalities complement each other both of us well okay i guess you're answering yeah so i think that kind of going back to what we're saying about you how you're more analytical how you're more like yeah yeah i think that out of the two of us believe it or not i'm i might be the more i don't i'm not more creative than you by any sense that were but like i'm more of a creative type though you're more artistically minded yes but you also are not again you're not like a like a weird flitty artist whatever nothing against that but it's that is those personalities are harder for me to work with you are very creative but you are able to like take your creative plans and put them into action in a logistical way that i can see and then execute yeah so i think so we're doing these videos and that kind of stuff like i need to know like all right we're shooting at this time we're doing this i'm gonna sit here i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this gonna do the monologue do whatever yeah yeah so i'd say like that that's how we complement each other okay yeah okay oh my turn no that's your turn okay yeah um oh okay before y'all end we got a bretton sheller gun show there we go are there some foreign countries you would like to visit peru greece greece sucks just kidding to all of our argent i think argentina would be very fun yeah i like central and latin american countries i think i like going to this i've actually always wanted to go to iceland i've always wanted to go to i went to ireland once for a week but i was sick and but it was great but i got really bad food poisoning so i kind of want to go back and and do that the proper way um okay okay uh what would be the perfect gift for me um anything involving this is for anybody who wants to send sheller gifts if we have any new fans of sheller um you can send him a new pair of shoes because this is ugly no it's just that one pair um no blu-ray that this is this is what you get when you're my producer um no you love blu-ray so some kind of blu-ray thing anything involving pc and computers give him like one of those things to build his own computer he just did that so we can do another one um i feel like i'm just saying the most basic stuff but if i was getting you a gift i would like google online like cool ray limited edition blue rays then it's going to be 4k blu-ray all right just okay get it right get it right get it right yes okay that's good that's all right cool all right oh yeah okay wait let's see um let's see where am i uh what game is that i need it it is we're not really strangers there's a bunch of different packs this is just the original one there's one for like friends co-workers relationships all that um let's see for an example on how to do a watch video look at all of the reaction videos like the reaction to righteous brothers okay somebody said have linus linus tech tips below daily wire themed gaming pc dude that would be awesome if lioness spilled us something linus what is this that would be awesome um let's see could use teamview to watch them and maybe have a competition and invite a couple of the fans to join the watch party that's cool um can y'all livestream watching the room oh that's a good movie that's no no no no no no no if you're thinking of the um movie different movie oh okay the room is we'll have to watch the trailer i'll i'll show it to you it's known as like the best worst movie ever made oh okay oh wait is that the one with them ah crap they did a movie james franco yes about making the right hi mark yes oh my god i've never seen the actual movie all right it's great are y'all posting this live yes we are pineapples are people too send your producer across the white dog he will have to keep it yes he will no i won't he would give it back to me to be honest i made a digital painting of you where do i send it oh that's really cool thank you um you can tweet it at me that's usually good or damn it to me i try to be good about going through those there's um it's probably the best way i guess i'll put i'll plaster his email everywhere you can send it to him yeah that's great all right go ahead um what do i need to hear right now you're very good at your job i actually don't know uh you're very you're good on camera oh he was he wasn't gonna he was going to sit over there and be the ominous voice and i was like come on you need to do it and i'm very glad that he did because i think it was fun yes so yeah i don't know i don't know if you needed to hear that but i thought i should tell you a nice view thank you you're so welcome okay um i'll probably wrap it up soon reflection oh this is not connection this is a reflection what am i most qualified to give advice about uh i think that you're most qualified to tell young people how to like the necessary steps to be successful oh that's nice that's that's what i would say yeah i appreciate that thank you all right go ahead scholars qualified to give advice about rays and film scores and film scores excuse me do you believe everyone has a calling if so do you think i've found mine um yeah producing comment section was literally everything that sheller was born to do to be honest i was born to do this yep knew it from a young age no i i it depends on how specific you want to be with calling like i don't think that there is maybe this is gonna ruffle some feathers i don't think that there's like one person for everybody i don't think that there's one perfect thing for you to be doing i just think that humans are more complex than that i do feel like in a way it's like at a general skill like i feel like i'm called to tell stories in a way like that's the thing i love most yeah yeah i feel like with you similar but more visually but you are you're called to be in like the creative world in some capacity so it's good that you're not you know sitting at a desk doing a i don't know some administrative job or whatever yeah that's fair so it's very general okay last ones or yeah last one yeah no that's gonna be cool hey what i'm a fellow based conservative libertarian influencer i'm going to be fleeing york for tennessee do you have any advice um make sure that you like barbecue and fried chicken the sweeter the tea the better it is i don't know just southern culture is very different but if you're going to nashville it's not too southern anymore but understanding the southern culture i think is very important to assimilating just because there's a lot of traditions but i don't know i was raised in the south so i don't love what you you came from somewhere else um what do you say what was the question again sorry he's moving from new york to tennessee and he wants some advice he's conservative um you will find it like very welcoming um it'll be a great change so like so much better than new york like that's the biggest thing just enjoy it better than new york better than los angeles uh everyone's really nice here so i am worried though that it's going to turn into another california because of all the people like us who have been in california or new york are here now but um yeah it's trying to keep it right really no advice just just be prepared to um have a a wonderful life change yes that's really nice that's wholesome and also and it's just like i was saying the personalities are very different here very different yeah so just the oh yeah here's another thing be prepared for the crappy drivers the drivers suck yeah but i mean if he's coming from new york if you were driving at all they're chaos the traffic is worse in la the people are insane and all their cars are hella expensive so you're terrified to get into a wreck because you're in front of you know a lamborghini and behind a mclaren but here they're just insane especially when it becomes winter and it's snowing nobody can drive yes okay so good okay how does one earn your vulnerable vulnerability um have i earned it how can i earn more how can you hear more um i think it just takes time i guess also other people's vulnerability allows me to open up more i used to have like my therapist used to say that i was like a steel wall yeah but my walls come down a lot i've broken through many of the layers so i think other people opening up i also feel like we have a lot of shared experiences yeah same types of humor too so that helps that makes you just feel more comfortable i guess yes so that's probably it i don't know just you still stick around okay that's how you're just more time yeah exactly gotcha oh this is a nice way to end it what is the lesson you will take away from our conversation um i think that you and i have a lot i just i think that we have a lot more in common than i originally thought we did so um i guess i guess that that's what i want to be taking away from this i already knew that we had a bunch of comment i felt like well i mean i i thought so too but just in the sense of like i don't know this is lame got emotions being friends with emotional um no no i am very very grateful this is going to be like emo or attendee or whatever but i'm very grateful that you're the one that produces the show because we do get along very well i feel like when you're doing this kind of shows we come in every morning some of it is written but it's like yesterday i'll be honest i had a really crappy day yesterday i just woke up i don't know if i was like on the wrong side of the bed whatever but it was just i was off of my game i felt super hectic and all over the place i'm not sure if you could like even tell it and how the edit turned out i think it ended up being good but i was just very on edge and it's because we are very similar and we've you know gotten into a good rapport i didn't feel like is it rapport yeah yeah that's why when i showed that's what i thought um i didn't feel judged in a way and i didn't feel like i was being rushed like we you know shot for longer than usual and i was stumbling over some stuff and i felt pretty stressed and if it had not been you even if it was like people that i am close with at the office but i feel like we get along as friends well even though you are my producer i didn't feel you know so that's nice oh yeah so it's just easy to work with you well i'm i'm glad that i create that environment there we go exactly um what is this okay let's see what these last few things are what is your what are your guys's all-time favorite movies sheller's gonna have like 15. that is like asking you know who's your favorite child no um i don't know i guess like i i get this question a lot uh but it's i have like a top five-ish sort of and i would say like empire strikes back um shawshank redemption jaws aliens uh glory and yeah i think that's a pretty disgusting bobby's upset in the corner as well um mine i don't know if i really have one oh no wait i do too i don't know why i said that um dead poets society and monty python holy grail deadpool society is great yeah uh brett could you please play a zelda game the only game that i've actually ever played in full is zelda ocarina of time legend of zelda um but yeah we'll have to do that as well and you guys should play cards against humanity yeah that's a lot less of a emotional game i think that'd be more up our alley we'll do that next time now that we're so close we're very close now let's see what is this oh hello this is an interesting sandy press donald trump jr next to fix us desantis vp get expert desantis he'll have uh 12 years straight to make there's time to get things done we know donald trump jr oh this person is saying that they want donald trump jr i don't really know much about djt same so i have no idea anyway what's the name of the girl i have no idea somebody said i'm looking over the normal chat right now this chat is random like me this the normal chat usually is i don't know how you guys people who are actually like deep in i can't do it stress me out do you guys see some of our big like daily wire livestream chats chaos wild wild west wild i tried it when i'm watching our live streams i try to go in and i'll like comment on things but you can barely keep up yeah it's tough um do either of you enjoy singing sheller was a theater kid i was a theater kid i was uh but i did not like the singing or dancing aspect of it that sucked so i liked it and then i was i was in theater when i was a kid but then when i got into high school uh i stopped musical theater and i would only do the dramatic productions and then i'd help tech backstage for the musicals that's cool yeah very cool i did more i did a lot more musicals than i did plays but that's you can look at me and see that i was a theater kid basically but no i i have not sung in a long time i can't believe i'm saying this there are singing videos of me out there from when i was like 12 years old if you were inclined to go find them a lot of you already have but they are out there but no i do really enjoy it singing is not something that i really do outside of theater though i don't know why i think that it's very that's something that feels really vulnerable i'm not just gonna you know film myself sitting in my bathroom singing but if i'm on stage if i'm in a character if it's part of a show then i really love it i was a dancer and i liked doing musical theater dancing and that kind of thing so yes we both sang at some point yes russ should be in the next day of our movie possibly possibly possibly yeah should watch firefly don't know what that is cards against humanity featuring all the daily wire hosts ouch cards against libs is that a real thing i know that there's all these special decks like cards against humanity like shakespeare things well i feel like most people that make these cards are probably libs and so there probably is not a i will make one okay we should make one yeah all right there we go that's happening um let's see last one how often a day do you get called female shapiro you get called it all the time yes it's really hard looking like a female bunch of beer over here no it's pretty often i don't really mind actually i did okay so we have a lie detector test this is gonna be the last thing because i do need to get off here but i we did a polygraph exam a friend of mine did with me for a video and one of the questions was do you ever get tired of being called female ben shapiro and i was i had to be honest i was like yeah because i don't it doesn't bother me but it is one of those things that i just get told all the time and i think it's funny when i get comments like has anybody ever told you this and it's like yes no no never thank you but it's nothing that like really gets on my nerves yeah but i do i am happy that i feel like i've you know carved my own space in the daily wire world and on youtube um because i don't really feel like i'm i'm not trying to write on like ben's coattails or anything like that so but i don't mind being told that i look like him it's a compliment according to the bench hero is hot page yes anyway uh we know your favorite movies we agree with you great commentary please bring sanity back after we lost uh the oe and the irs we all miss snowden to santa's cooper uh yeah we do all miss snowden anyway guys all right thank you for hanging out with us this was a fun very different type of livestream so i'm very grateful that you all gave sheller a warm welcome yes thank you for being very welcoming towards my presence i appreciate that yes maybe we'll have his face back on but you will always hear his voice in the background and yes if you guys are new here if you joined late this is the real sheller he is my producer um and finally got him on camera to meet you all so everybody say goodbye tell him that he does a good job because he puts up with my stuff and manages all of the things you can't see behind these cameras which is a lot of

"cgGxXgyA51g": "I will always advocate for a teacher but like I you gotta know your place I my goal is not to sit there and teach a child about sexual orientation and identity right my job is if Joanne has two moms to let you know that some kids have two moms and we'll leave it at that and you're when you say open the book open the book and then give it to a parent and the parent can explain quite frankly I I don't know enough about how a child will process that at five I just want that that five-year-old who does have two moms to feel safe oh my God this is such a white pill this gives me hope in teachers this is incredible I love this man I want to be friends with this man somebody replied and said it has always confused me why my sexuality has to be everybody else's business these days like when you meet me you don't need to know that shocking amazing somebody else said what a great age-appropriate way to make sure that there's inclusion again age appropriate I love that he also brought up like I don't know if a five-year-old would be able to process that which I love because apparently some people have forgotten the children have a different mental capacity than adults somebody else said I love this it's just like explaining that some kids are raised by a grandma move on incredible yes", "tCiXCFiP_Uo": "hey guys welcome back to off the clock these are some of my firsts [Music] first thing I do in the morning check Twitter actually first I fed my dogs and I drink water out of my exceptionally large thermos and then I check Twitter the first thing I did when I hit a million subscribers uh called my mom uh first pet his name was Ollie I actually had him for 16 years and he died back in August and he was a great Pyrenees mixed with something either a lab or some kind of Australian Shepherd a first summary of acting I was a bush in my kindergarten school play and then right after that I was a munchkin in The Wiz my brother's high school first film or show um like professionally the first show I ever did in theater was La Boheme at the Atlanta Symphony Opera was the first thing I was paid for and then I don't remember what my first film thing was I actually think it was the O's commercial for Furby those little pets the weird those things I don't think it actually ever air but it was the first like on camera thing I did right after I moved to LA her celebrity crush oh okay the little boy in Peter Pan who played Peter Pan in the live action I thought he was the bee's knees funnily enough he ended up becoming like the exact opposite of my type but at the time and throughout Middle School like that is what I looked for in a young man I don't really remember but he was like tan and like blonde like puka shell necklace wearing a little Peter Pan boy yeah yeah that was it uh first use of clothing I bought I have no idea I bought a lot of stuff at thrift stores once I had some of my own money because I didn't really have a lot to spend so probably something there I don't know I mean I like shopping but I don't think I love clothes enough to really remember like a purchase that big I guess uh first song on my favorite playlist I'm throwing my phone everywhere okay my favorite playlist which one I usually just go on my favorites but ooh okay this one's good uh like 19.99 Late Night Mix by Valley that's the first song I'm probably the playlist I listen to the most okay um first big purchase probably my car uh my first car was a 2018 2017 Kia Niro and I got it because it had even better gas mileage than a a Prius I got 56 miles per gallon in that puppy and that was my commuter car because I would drive from Burbank California in the valley all the way to UCLA it's a great car I miss it my mom still has it first album I ever purchased okay that would be on like iTunes or some kind of CD I guess it would either be the Revival of anything goes with sun Foster or probably actually I was obsessed with Sutton Foster her first like non-musical theater album that she did that one I don't remember what it was called she had a song about an air conditioner which is so weird um and then Sara Bareilles probably her album it's a blessed unrest one of those three probably anything goes okay first movie I saw in the theater I'm guessing something like an IMAX National Geographic thing we didn't really go see movies in my family we just like didn't watch TV or do any of that but I would go on field trips when I was still in public school which was like kindergarten through first grade so that's probably the first okay first job I was like a Mother's Helper and so that is that was before I could even babysit on my own I was very proud because I got my like CPR certification and all that stuff so I was able to be a mother's helper my first like real job job like clot like punching a clock was a Trader Joe's and I was there for five years first plane trip that I mean I was like four months old I started flying when I was really young I have no idea we lived in Washington so probably back to see like my mom or dad's family first concert Sara Bareilles it was it some actually might have been in Nashville we drove up from Chattanooga it was in some Amphitheater first Hobby oh reading I'm really boring but reading the first piece of advice to my younger self continue taking risks maybe also something about friendship I don't really know yeah I could say I could keep taking risks I want to get my younger self more advice about friendship because I think that was something I really struggled with I don't really know what I would say I had to think about them more anyway first song I listen to when I'm down okay well I listen to songs that like make me feel sadder because I uh emo whatever um and that would probably be supposed to by blue eyes that was also my number one song of 2022 which says a lot about my emotional well-being sometimes okay first time I was Starstruck would be I was on the Disney back lot going to an audition and I was walking side by side with Rob Lowe and he was dressed in Scrubs because he was doing some medical drama and I had no idea and I looked over and I was like that was right in the middle of my Parks and Rec phase first time I was grounded okay I've only ever been grounded once and I turned off my location that like on Life360 I didn't think it would send my mom a notification it did and I told her I was going to be at one place and then I was actually like sitting on my friend's lawn at like 2 A.M and I came home and she knew that the location had been turned off and I was locked out and so I had to sit outside the window and tap on her bedroom window be like I'm sorry I got ground I think that's the only time though first thing I do to relax uh sit outside on my patio with the dogs first makeup Obsession oh really know if I have Pro maybe like lip gloss maybe mascara I don't know I really didn't get into it much probably some kind of lip gloss or whatever first meaningful gift I actually was talking about this on a live stream the other day but my brother's got me a trampoline when I was like six or so five I think for my birthday and or no it was Christmas oh one of those because my birthday's in the fall but they built it in the backyard themselves and so I was walked outside and I saw this awesome trampoline but in more recent years my brother got me an incredible like real silver David yerman dinner ring I love it I wear it all the time it is incredibly precious to me I mean it's not as

member or friend find it all at bullyingmax.com Cooper again booleanmax.com Cooper first social media account Facebook and I remember because you had to be 13 and I was definitely not 13 so I lied about my age but I got my mom to help me first cell phone oh I had a one of those phones it like had a touch screen on the front of it but you would slide it out it had a keyboard and then like everything would flip horizontally I don't remember what it was but I was not allowed to have a smartphone it was just enough to get me by so that I wouldn't get like lost or kidnapped somewhere first time I was recognized in public oh um trying to think of okay well I got a DM from somebody who was like I saw you in Costco and but they didn't come up to me but that I was like oh gosh okay I guess this is happening and then it was probably at some point on Broadway because I had friends come into town like back in the spring and I went out with them and there were a few people there and it was very weird because people would like yell it and then a couple weeks later it like all happened at once and then a couple weeks later I was like on some rooftop and this guy was like yelling Over the Bar and was like pointing at me and like holding up my Instagram and it's like is this you like that's what a lot of people do they come up to me and they're like is this actually you I guess it is um sometime in this prank but it was on Broadway which was like kind of embarrassing but okay okay first thing people get wrong about me there's a lot of people that will criticize me and say like oh she's only on the right or she only says these things because she's had like an incredibly privileged life and she doesn't know anything and to that I say listen to any of the times that I've talked about my family or my upbringing I do feel very fortunate and very many in like a lot of ways but I also think there's more below the surface to everybody so I think context is important first Dream Come True would be oh my car well that isn't my first dream come true there's a lot of dreams that have come true I feel very fortunate and that that I got to pursue my passions especially at a young age because I got to act so that would only be like the first big one just that I got to do that and I got to have an acting career at a young age but the first thing that came to my mind randomly is that I've always wanted the car that I have now and it's not some like fancy car I've just always got in my head that I wanted it and I bought it last year and that was fun uh first time I felt like an adult when I emancipated myself legally so that I guess I did first song I was obsessed with Fire and Rain by James Taylor first time I felt like I made it I guess this is supposed to be about career stuff but I think there's a lot of things in my personal life that I feel like I got through or persevered through and maybe that's I think that has more meaning to me when I was applying for colleges that also because I cared so much about academics that was huge for me I remember I got into UC Berkeley Columbia and UCLA on the same day and that was like one of facilities one of the greatest days of my life because I worked my ass off and so that was pretty cool and I felt like I was Paving my own way was doing something that a lot of people in my family hadn't done so it was cool at first I learned how to cook I don't know if this is the first thing because I would bake a lot with my mom but probably the first thing I've made independently which is not really cooking is my go-to snack when I was younger was one of two things was a tortilla with peanut butter rolled up I would warm up the tortilla and I put peanut butter on it and roll it up still to this day fantastic snack and then number two and I guess this really sells the cooking but I was able to make it at a young age was banana milk which is the thing my mom came up with and it was like frozen bananas and milk and a little bit of sugar and vanilla it was like smoothie first advice I received that's stuck I say this all the time but don't take yourself too seriously but take your life seriously right or wait I always get this wrong because I think it can go both ways I remember my friend Amira actually does this thing where he's with his friends and he says like oh what's some advice you have for somebody today and he puts it on his story and I said this because it has stuck with me but I always get the like specifics wrong but basically it's like my mom has always said that you should take your life and your work seriously and yourself and all of that but the world around you you should be able to you know laugh at things and you know not take things too seriously I don't remember I always forget whether it's don't take yourself too seriously but take life seriously or the other way around but the sentiment still gets cross I think so I guess it really hasn't stuck that much because I don't remember the actual specifics but the meaning is stuck with me uh first thing somebody should do when visiting Nashville I guess go to Broadway don't do it uh no go during the day and you can see it you see what it looks like because I know you're gonna do it anyway I know you are so I shouldn't try to keep you from it but 12 South is really cute that's where I tell everybody to go uh first thing I did after getting the gig with daily wire packing my boxes and getting ready to move I actually was I took the call when I actually like confirmed that I got it and I was in the middle of like helping my mom build a fence and so I think I put down the phone and went back outside and continued doing that so literally was like outside doing some kind of farm work but then I started packing my boxes because I moved in 10 days first I'm feeling embarrassed oh my god when my pants fell down my skirt fell down in the middle of an Indian buffet I was holding my tray of like Tikki Masala walking back to my table and I was wearing a skirt that was a little too big because when you're a kid your parents always buy you clothes that are like a little too big maybe this is just my like middle class my mom was pretty Frugal experience of like always buying like a size up or having those skirts with like the elastic that you would like really tighten like I remember I barely had clothes would fit because I would grow through them so fast and we always got sizes too big and I had this new skirt and I really wanted to wear it and I remember my mom saying you know it's too big for you and I was like I don't care I don't care and I went to this Indian buffet with her for lunch what we were doing at the Indian buffet and I was walking back and my skirt just went and fell completely off of me and I was just there in my underwear in the middle of an Indian buffet at like six years old pretty cool first shoes I bought probably some like bright red Mary Jane thing I was really into Mary Jane's I like those whole like the little like oh also lime green clogs I was really into lime green I had lime green clogs I had lime green Crocs multiple variations of the Crocs the original and like again the Mary Jane type Crocs on brand first thought about my future if I'm saying like right now I like think about having kids and getting married okay so I've been told that that was the uh last first prompt that I was given but I did tell the story the other day so I feel like it's worth it um My First Kiss was in an acting class and that story horrifies people because they think about their first kisses and they're like oh my God I was like such like it was such a pivotal moment no I was in an acting class in front of like 25 people and the guy in in like the scene I had to go kiss him I was probably 13 I think and I had to go kiss him and he was so nervous it was also his first kiss he went like this and pulled his lips back so I just I kissed that that was it and then I think my like second two kisses were like on acting jobs and then like in acting classes and that when I say that to people that are not in the acting world they're like oh this is so upsetting and then in the acting world it's like oh yeah that's pretty normal like none of us like I think about my childhood and it's full of like the most random weird kind of artificial experiences because I was always on sets well that's all for today but if you have any other burning questions or you want me to elaborate on any of these stories you can always come join my weekly

excited about it um so i hope you all are liking it um i oh my god i opened up twitter and obviously we all know that p davidson and kim k broke up last week but this headline of martha stewart just responds to the rumors that she's dating pete davidson i think we all saw the memes of you know like oh what old lady not old lady but like who is you know pete going to date next that's you know 15 years older than her him uh martha stewart was not somebody that i was expecting but uh i guess here we are so here bobby can you pull this up on the screen if you have not already so this is where it all came from i just have to you guys know i love talking about pete davidson so we had to do it um okay so here it is somebody said we should have seen this coming and it is pete davidson holding hands with martha stewart while he was still with kim k first of all kim k looks like a demon in this thing first of all her hair looks wet she looks like she just got out of the shower and she looks like an alien like the woman's hot but that's a scary look um and there's martha stewart hanging on for dear life with pete davidson and so martha goes against basically all social media rules and decides to address these rumors martha don't feed into that um i actually am fine with her feeding into it because it means that i get things to talk about um let's see oh thank you so much lord carbonite am i saying that right uh thank you so much i appreciate it i don't two million next month would be absolutely insane i think i need to give myself like a couple months you know guys we gotta take some time to celebrate and breathe and then we'll hit 2 million obviously um mr random i'm so excited you got the cream oversized t-shirt i think that's been like a crowd favorite as of right now that is probably my personal favorite i've been wearing it a bunch the fabric is super super cool that was one thing when we were going through i got to pick all of the you know fabrics and you know the apparel companies we were using um and that was one thing i wanted was like a really like not stiff but like a comfortable and like durable shirt that you could you know it could be oversized and it could be comfortable but it's like a kind of t-shirt that i would want to hang up um and wear so that you guys are you know proud wearing it so anyway i'm so excited i'm really proud of all of it so i think it'll be cool um let's see uh feeling dangerous got my merch ordered question will we have any more guests on soon i really enjoy it hopefully we are also i think you guys saw the shocking truth episode with amir odom who's one of my best friends um we're gonna keep doing that it was going to be a one-off thing and sean is here sean is the one who produced that video he's one of my producers um and it did so well and we had such a good time with it i think sean just had a like weird psycho good time with it because he was getting to shock me and making me uncomfortable and exposing all of my truths look at him laughing over there like a little demon um anyways we're gonna bring it back we're gonna do more things like that and i'm so excited um we'll definitely have more guests um uh martha done with snoop listen martha loves oh yeah i need to get back to this martha apparently loves skinny little potheads like that seems to be the trend i i'm not gonna hate her for it because everybody's got a type but apparently this is martha's okay so here we go i'm back to this um so here we go uh rumors emerged after this photo okay so here we go in an interview with daily mail martha gushes about her close relationship with pete but puts down the rumors immediately b davidson is like the son i never had he is a charming boy who is finding his way i don't really know if i would describe pete davidson as charming i think my usual term for him is wet cigarette man um but here's the thing i have to be honest when he first started on snl i liked him i even i will i will admit that i thought that he was cute and i thought that he was funny and it was before he became like a basement pothead covered with tattoos seems depressed and whatever all the time um and i thought that he i had hoped that he was gonna be like this emerging star you know on snl obviously that did not really go well now he's kind of like some weird cult social media whatever i don't know he kind of moved from being a comedian to just being like a personality in a way but i will say i had hopes and at that point seven years ago because he had a seven year long contract with snl i would have also said that he was a charming boy who was finding his way at this point i'm like dude you're a man who needs to like work on your posture and like figure it out anyway that's my hot take but maybe he just needs a little love from martha to pull it all together she apparently has a podcast and wants him to come on it my god imagine i would kill for this imagine martha stewart snoop dogg and pete davidson all smoking weed add joe rogan to the mix actually i know joe rogan is way too good for that that would be like a hot mess um let's see uh fans took to social media to speculate who he would be dating next um it's just ridiculous i don't really know what he's going to do apparently he's shooting a rom-com right now that's not that's a thing guys he is doing a rom-com with uh oh who was it i think i pulled it up kelly who's the girl from um oh god i think it's big bang theory kelly cuckoo cuckoo do you know bobby cuoco it was like so delicate like hello i'm not entirely sure but something like that i think she is in it with him anyway he has a wrong comment he's doing that in australia which is apparently the reason he broke up with kim that's kind of a baller move though to break up with kim kardashian i give him that like i don't think there are many men that once they got with kim kardashian they would be like oh sure i'm like happy to give that up um so anyway good for him i guess um anyway i did want to talk about that at the beginning but then guys i saw something else that i feel like we need to discuss i might do it on the show tomorrow but i also feel like this would be great for a live stream did you all see this came out today actually it came out yesterday that there is the first trans olympian man so female to male transgender athlete which is kind of exciting in a way because we've been talking about these men transitioning to women you know biological men taking over women's sports and we have asked the question like okay where are the biological women winning all of these awards in men's sports news flash they really don't exist all of your everything and take hormones biologically if you are a fully grown adult you will still like there are some things that you simply just cannot change bone structure you know you're that honestly is the big one but everything like you cannot fully you know change your hormones all of that um i absolutely butchered that but something caught my eye over here sorry i'm like a shiny little some things are distracting me anyway this guy now a guy formerly a girl um is a rugby player i believe she aliyah announced his her transition becoming the first olympian to come out as a trans man it was just yesterday and uh aaliyah ilya did a video for the bingham cups international summit on tackling transphobia and homophobia in sport opened up about their identity shared pronouns and all of that so this person is already retired so they're just coming on to basically be an activist in a way but they are never going to be competing as a man in olympian sports so even though this is interesting and it's kind of a new wrinkle in the timeline we still don't see any trans men dominating men's sports not going to happen i'm just putting it out there but i do want to watch the video with you so this is like that article if you want to go look at it it's trending on twitter right now um and people have different various thoughts but i have not even seen the full video so we're going to watch it together so everybody buckle up here we go ellia and i am honored to be a part of the overall yeah summit today [Music] thank you to everyone that has taken the time to be here and to show their support for the trans and gender diverse community imagine not being able to do what you love because of how you identify banning transgender people from sport i think is disgraceful and i think it's hurtful you know i think that the rates of suicide and mental health will get even worse i say that because you know i guess speaking from myself i played professional rugby sevens for australia first of all just i don't to be honest most of the time and i don't know you guys let me know if this is accurate most the time if it is a female to male i mean obviously you can usually tell somebody's transgender but it's very difficult to like look like a man i feel like like think about like ellen elliott paige it's like you don't look this person i actually if i didn't know they were trans i would think it was just like a beefy dude but that's probably just the rugby no i agree okay i just had to put that out there what surgeons are getting good the surgeons are getting good but i also just like starting from like the stocky stature of a rugby i've actually never seen a game of rugby but i have seen rugby play it is i know that it's like angry women like running and tackling each other basically sean it's like football on steroids that actually and apparently they're not wearing helmets which means that they're even crazier i don't even watch football ever i've been to one football game in my life so i need to really expand my sporting events anyway we're gonna get back to it i just had to say that all right here we go for around 10 years but i am retired now i was fortunate enough to be a part of the team that played in the 2016 rio olympics and we won a gold medal and it was the most incredible feeling to be a part of it hi john by the way so i was the end of my career i was starting to have some difficulties with my mental health and i guess one promise that i made to myself that when my rugby career ended i would continue to live the rest of my life in the identity in the body that i i should have and that's a really difficult thing to do in this time of day i mean all you have to do is turn on the tv look on social media platforms and you can see the amount of bullying harm and discrimination that goes on about gender identities it's extremely harmful so for someone to be obviously there is crap on the internet about you can find a bully in basically every corner of the internet but just to you know set this person straight every cultural institution society in general all of the elites they are in favor of everything that you're doing so you might find a troll online or somebody that's saying hey like i don't really subscribe to this gender identity whatever i don't believe that it's fluid you know like myself i believe that there are two genders and you know you can change whatever you want about yourself to live authentically not going to like change your biology and it just does not work that way but the whole western world at this point really this country um especially is with you so you can make this whole like victim thing but like i said every institution every cultural and social institution has your back it is interesting where is this person from do we know hold on what is this they have some kind of accent i'm not really sure but it is interesting because america is the furthest along in all of this you know gender ideology crap like the netherlands you know the those countries they are starting to ban a lot of these like hormone therapies and gender surgeries especially with young people and they're you know pushing therapy and talk therapy that sort of thing before taking these huge medical steps wherein in the united states we are now seeing children's hospitals promoting hysterectomies so maybe there's a difference there uh which is just i don't know i just had to put that out there because people like to say that the united states is so people on the left like to say that the united states is so backwards and so we're so behind on things we need to be like europe we need to get all this universal healthcare we need to be better we need to be more progressive it's like we aren't like the most progressive out of anybody at this point they are laughing at us like anybody on either side of the political aisle realizes that we are not a strong country right now that people internationally are laughing at us and we have this like beacon of hope that comes from our history of being like the leader in the free world and having these incredible ideals that we were founded upon that we fought for and that still holds true but like these days like it's tough like everybody's kind of pissed off okay just how to put that out there all right we're gonna finish this open and honest about that um to the public eye is absolutely daunting so i spent a lot of time after i um after i finished up my career with australian rugby austria okay just in the house in a dark room i hadn't been picked for the tokyo olympics so um i felt like a complete failure and this was it was heartbreaking i really took that as a reflection on my whole self as a person so i was unable to leave the house and yeah but the one thing that kept me positive was the fact that i had planned my surgery my top surgery and it was something that i had been literally counting down the days with my beautiful partner i just knew it was going to be the most liberating feeling when i had that surgery and when i would start to take the steps towards being in the body that i know i meant to be in so that was definitely something that was a bright like a bright spark in my in my mind during this dark time i just wish some people would maybe realize that it is like really really stressful and i don't know just hard when people ask you so many questions instead of just saying hey that's that's great like i respect that like that's awesome that's literally all you know i think some people take it as almost like you're saying you're an alien just because you're not fitting into the social norm of being male or female so those listening um or to those it's not a social norm it's science because you don't fit into a box no there there are boxes and you fit into them there is a binary i'm just saying i watched a tick tock this morning of this teacher who was so proud of her students realizing that some people just don't have a gender and she was like my eight-year-olds they just know that i'm genderless i was like like this is so it's so concerning it's like it's the most basic tenets of biology so i think you guys know now if you've been like watching lives of tick tock if you've seen any of my shorts doctors these days and i did a whole episode on it you can go back i think it's the um yes they're coming for your kids segment um it's all of these doctors who are now asking children at like the age of three um like are you a boy or a girl and i think up until this point i need to call my mom and ask if you know that was a normal thing with my brothers and if we were asked that and if you had asked me about this question like four years ago i would have said that was probably to you know see if the if the kid can distinguish gender just like oh okay we're doing like this color this shape whatever cognitive do you know this about yourself that makes sense but now regardless of why that question was started now they are asking it to figure out these literal toddlers gender identity and there are so many stories online of parents being asked this question having their child be asked this question and then the kid goes oh it's a boy like i'm a girl and then it's like oh okay then we'll just start transitioning and then there's these stories of these parents that are going oh yeah my five-year-old has been out for two years no it has not been out for five years you have been making it live as the opposite gender for two years like at least be honest like yeah it's your kid they're gonna do what you put in front of them if you put dresses in front of them they will wear the damn dresses i don't even know how i got on this tangent but it was something in regards to this oh the whole like non-binary genderless whatever so yes ma'am sir there is a binary and you must fit in one of the male female boxes just saying anyway okay finishing it up you might have a story even the slightest bit similar to mine i would just love to tell you that it does get better and it has taken me so much courage to even take the steps to sit here right now and talk about it my heart is racing my palms have been sweating this is the first time that i have been so open to talk about this and the main reason is because i am so worried about the reaction of people or will people treat me differently will friends or family love me any less you know are people going to get a shock um you know what will what will the media say about me and the thing is even without changing genders changing appearance identity people are always going to have something to say whether that be positive or negative and actually true in 10 years of being a professional rugby player so why not just live the rest of your life exactly as you want to be because life is just too short to live it as something else and you are beautiful you know just to find common ground because i always think that's important and i think as you know somebody who you know attempts to be empathetic and to you know understand people and reach people i did like the ending of that video i like the message i like saying you know because it's very true and i talk about this all the time if you put yourself out there publicly if you are any kind of public figure if you are if you do what i do if you are an athlete if you are just a young person on social media with a public account people are going to think things about you they're going to say things about you they're going to make assumptions and there's really nothing you can do about that you can try to combat it you can try to dispel rumors whatever that's just how it goes living in this modern age and so i do believe that it is good to live authentically and that's why i do try to reach people especially who have been quiet about their beliefs if they are more right leaning or if they are you know straying from their families you know political beliefs if they're going to disappoint people whatever do what feels authentic to you have the courage to stand up for your values have the courage to you know stand up and say this is me and so i do like that message that's great i might not agree with you know the choice that you're making but you're an adult and that's your life so whatever as long as you're not trans and kids that's a whole different story and i will like rip you apart in that regard but to find common ground that's a good message and you can apply what this person is saying to many different scenarios i'm choosing to apply it to something that is more political because that's kind of the space that i'm in and that's the people that i interact with and i do get so many dms and comments from people going like i'm so nervous to you know even repost one of your videos i had a woman come up to me the other day in nashville and say like ah like i do this and this i really like your videos but i have to be quiet because i don't want to be kicked off of this or whatever and it's so heartbreaking because we do live in this culture that is so so divisive that you can't even just speak out about the things that you believe in and we should be able to live in a culture where you can debate and you can agree to disagree and you can still find common ground with people that you like fully disagree with so i do try to do that as much as possible so you know in terms of trying to do that i do like what you said at the end of that um you she whatever um least you need to go back and say uh ben says god these people just love to talk about themselves don't they they really do they do it's all about their journey and their whatever and how they're all victims and everything everything is about them and it is attack on them an attack on them it is an attack on them by an oppressive system that's the usual one because they can never pinpoint what actually is happening because they're not actually facing real oppression it's like the modern day feminists where they're going like oh like i'm oppressed it's like who is oppressing you the system like give me one example then they say like the wage gap and i'm like well ma'am you're choosing to be a teacher like there's your wage gap i guarantee the chemistry teacher down the hall who is a man is making the same amount as you are that kind of thing um let's see is this mr rogers neighborhood for adults where we all play pretend basically i did um especially with women especially with women i talked about this um yesterday in a video about the um guy who was rushing at alabama brushing like trying to get into a sorority and was so heartbroken that all of these alabama sororities were like no you're a man and this guy was not even trying to transition that's the thing it was not a transgender person it was just a guy who still goes by a man's name who just started to wear dresses a few months ago and decided he wanted to be part of a sisterhood it's like bro it doesn't really work that way go join a co-ed go join a frat i don't really care get some female friends but going back to the whole like where we all play pretend one thing that i pointed out is that womanhood as we are putting in all of these people who are you know you're a man that wants to wear a dress you're a drag queen you're a whatever you are a biological man who's now identifying as one whatever womanhood has become about playing dress-up and it's all pretend and we have basically been reduced and boiled down to this kind of costume art and i think it even goes for like biological straight whatever women where i even feel not less than or ridiculous but if i go out like wearing a t-shirt and jeans and like not a lot of makeup on and i see these girls that are like botox to the nines dying their hair 15 different colors trying to dress up as like insane as possible almost matching the level of drag queens and it's like god is that what i uh but in this culture where everybody thinks you can just cut your hair in a certain way apparently go by some different pronouns and then suddenly you are a gender it's like no it truly does not work that way there's my rant on modern day womanhood get ready for the episode coming out tonight is the oh he was dealt a bad hand of cards he had coveted a couple weeks ago now he's bedridden so i miss him dearly everybody say bye chiller um let's see oh what is this oh here we go oh apparently i uh glitched for a second but i'm back now i guess yeah it's back up now okay sorry um anyway so sheller long story short everybody tell sheller that you miss him because his back is hurting um okay what was i doing here let's see oh anyway that is a shallow question but i do have an episode coming out tonight where we do talk about womanhood again because there is a man biological man who does identify as a man he was appointed to a vast few streams but he's back it was very exciting my dudes are back i have a few guys that are always here they're great let's see am i back oh my god sorry guys today has just been a whirlwind i don't know over here in the studio my wi-fi was also being funky earlier this morning and my social media wasn't working it was just saying no data or any whatever so maybe it's a server problem i don't know but i'm happy to be back um let's see um happy birthday evan everybody wish evan happy birthday it is his 18th birthday um pete really went from grammy to grandma oh my god my god um somebody said i feel like pete hasn't recovered mentally from the death of his dad on 9 11. yes and that is something that i have not talked about as much i think i talked about it on one of the videos but that isn't a really important factor to point out as much as i like to make fun of pete davidson and i think he needs to you know take some accountability and get his life together his father was a firefighter in new york died in 9 11. he's spoken a lot about the impact that that made on his life um so obviously it is important to recognize that because whether we like it or not the trauma that we go through as children and this is such a leftist talking point in a way talking about like trauma and that sort of thing and i don't think it should be because everybody in their life has dealt with crap we've all been handed cards that we wish we never had to deal with we can't always control the situations in our life but where i think i differ from a lot of people who are you know more on the left side of things who want to talk who kind of dominate the conversation about mental health and that sort of thing is that there comes a point where that trauma can't be an excuse anymore it doesn't mean that you forget about it and you move on from it and you you know stop recognizing it but you use it as some kind of you know ammunition and power to grow to be better and at some point you have to take accountability and say yes this is part of my life i'm going to use this and do something good i'm going to use this become a better person so i don't pass this along to my kids so i don't wreck havoc on my family and the world around me because at some point it's just gonna be crippling to you and i've dealt with that firsthand i've seen it in my family if you guys have followed me for a while you've probably seen on streams i've talked about you know my family and my brother um and a lot of the things that we've gone through and there was so much crap in my life that i've had people say when they end up hearing like all of the different you know situations with my family and they go like how are you a normal functioning person and then on top of that being like a kid in hollywood like in some other like timeline had i had a different mother had i had a different upbringing had i had like a different foundation i could be royally messed up but there comes a time when you have to say i'm going to change the narrative i'm going to break the cycle and i'm very proud to say that i think i have when it comes to my family so that would be my message on that kind of thing um let's see um thank you so much ajm1991 um he has been working two other jobs in biden's america just to make it went to the hospital that i'm okay thank god send prayers um i will be thinking of you i'm grateful that you are taking the time that's one thing that's what i say like thank you for spending part of your day with me like the world is such a busy place people are trying to make ends meet right now because this man is running our country into a dumpster fire so the fact that you all take 15 20 times an hour out of your day to watch this content to be here to comment it means so much to me and that's why i do feel like this is a community and it genuinely because i mean i know there are only a few creators that i watch religiously and it's because i do feel like they add something of value to my life and my day so it truly means a lot um let's see um we need to catch up this ooh nathaniel you inspire me to start a conservative activism club if liberals get their safe space then we should too love it that is the kind of action that i like to see whether you are a conservative or not wherever you fall on the political spectrum finding like-minded people is so important being able to have people that you can you know agree with your values on and obviously it's good to debate people it's good to have people with different backgrounds that's one reason why i love doing the show is because i feel like i get a pretty ideologically diverse audience which keeps me on my toes make sure that my arguments are always strong and that i'm coming from like a principled and like a strong philosophical foundation that always keeps me in check but regardless of all of that this is such a divisive world and it often feels very alienating if you're speaking out about your value so it is so important to find people that on a fundamental level agree with you and support the things that you say where you can bounce off your opinions you can really mold them and make them stronger so i love that and if you are not in some kind of club if you're especially if you're a student um tpusa yaf um prageru's prager force is amazing if you're a young person or a young professional um so go find those like-minded groups um it is so i mean it was super helpful for me let's see um 100 bucks says colin kaepernick is the next trans athlete my god listen the man has basically he blew up his own football career for activism rode that wave got his little netflix documentary equated football to the football draft to the slave trade and now after years off and he wasn't even that good to begin with he's trying to get back in he's doing all these training things and apparently his you know workouts are not great so this person is kind of spot on because if it doesn't work out for him he's going to have to find something else to about and gripe about and maybe that will be him becoming a woman and then just watch one of these woke teams is going to go sure come on we love the first female football player let's see um thank you so much for cooper out of context guys if you are not following that channel they also have a twitter account or no do you guys have twitter no there's a daily wire out of context i'm not sure if you guys are on twitter but the youtube channel is very funny um screwed up i also have to give a shout out uh to him as well he always does very fun meme edits so if you guys are into that sort of thing those are two channels that do fun things with my content i always appreciate that like it's very fun to see you guys um what what you find interesting in my lives and my videos let's see um oh thanks so much james appreciate you being here uh and can you ask jeremy to open up the stores worldwide it is only limited to us i know i i don't know how to fix that and all we can do but yes right now as as it is as it stands the merch is just it can only ship in the united states um hopefully in the future can figure out how to rectify that because we are going to be doing different merch lines and i have a pretty big international audience so i want to make sure that if you guys want that kind of stuff you can get it i need to find some things that i can do for international folks though because i don't want to exclude you um joe said glad you survived uh hollywood as a child unlike fergie drew barrymore and brook shields my god yeah drew barrymore she's doing better now she had a whole that's like such a heartbreaking story she emancipated herself very young in her memoir she was talking about how she was you know being given drugs and getting drunk at like age seven at these hollywood parties which seems like very outlandish but that's the kind of stuff that happens every single day um so it seems like she's on a better track now i think but i'm very very grateful to the team that i had and my mom and my family who really kept me grounded during this andrew i was sad to see that there's no krusty white dog merch i need to get some rocky deserves she deserves some kind of tribute on here um we shot a video this morning where i was referencing rocky and i was so sad that i couldn't bring her in for it but as i said in the video which you will see it'll come out this weekend i think i was saying that i think she's gotten a little too big for her britches she's been in here too many times she's taking over my show no i don't really care the real thing and i also mentioned this in the video is that she's super stinky right now and needs to get groomed because she was rolling around in the dirt yesterday so there was no way in hell she was gonna be on camera because that would be an embarrassment um let's see uh thank you so much moonshine parallelogram that's just a fantastic name i have just to give you that um thank you so much i really appreciate it um let's see uh i'm an 18 year old guy with no friends so being able to watch a show with like-minded a person of the age of the same age is so great i really appreciate that that's another thing i hope i hope that i can be you know if you guys don't have a group of like-minded friends and that sort of thing i will be your friend um i hope that you can feel like you know some kind of common sense and rationality in a very confusing and messed up twisted world um but seriously since you're 19 you should look into pragerforce i talk about them all the time i started at prageru i started in prayer force they really gave me the whole lift they gave me the confidence that i needed to start making videos i didn't even think that i was going to do this i was still acting at the time and i was trying to figure out what i wanted to do because i wasn't really happy acting and i thought that it was going to be way too inconsistent for a long time career and so i was in college i wasn't sure what to do covet happened and i joined pragerforce just to kind of this was after i lost all my ucla friends and i was desperate to find some sort of like-minded community and they are incredible so if you are under the age of 30 if you're a young professional or a student join them you will meet incredible people their social media platforms are great they have a great facebook group it truly is like if you are in need of that kind of community that is a fantastic place and it's online too you don't have to be like in a specific location um let's see i mean yeah i'm watching you all running wire in an attic right now so we've got our pick of who will spend any time watching i appreciate that look at that we're making time um that must be i have no words other than i'm glad that i am here while you're working um i don't know anything i'm guessing that you're an electrician i know nothing about that so good on you i will let you just take a minute we have to do a shout out to if you guys are any blue collar workers in here you are literally keeping this country going like the this country is crumbling to the ground we are living in the midst of a dumpster fire our supply chain is absolutely screwed up inflation is skyrocketing gas price is starting to go down but we really can't give biden credit for that because he made them soar for most of the year um and it seems impossible to get anything done you've heard me talk about wow i can't get my dogs groomed because literally there are not enough dog groomers in nashville it's just hard to make appointments so for you guys who are literally keeping operations in this country going you are so important like i hope that you know that because we need you like we cannot survive without you so i appreciate that let's see uh oh my god how did somebody who was not allowed to watch television become an actress listen man i don't know i do not understand uh my mom said well here here's the thing i didn't start in television i started in theater and the only reason i started doing theater was because i was deathly shy um after my brother died my brother died when i was about five i was always pretty like you know bouncy and bubbly but i remember i was just so it was kind of like shell shocked in a way and my family was so kind of broken open that i think i i remember a shift being very young of like oh something doesn't feel right and i just kind of went inward in a way i literally remember in our old house in chattanooga um me literally hiding in a cupboard i had this little cupboard where it was like all of my like kid plates and that sort of thing and i literally went in there and shut the door and hid and i started doing that at our second house as well i would hide in cupboards like i was i was so shy and my mom was very very good at finding ways to push me out of my comfort zone whether that was like hey go talk to this person i'm going to watch you but go in there by yourself and say hi to them talk to them like really try to push me um and then so i started in theater for that reason she wanted me to you know get out of my shell i did musical theater productions at my brother's high school because they would have like the younger siblings of students participate and we knew some of the people who were in the theater department so she had me like jump up on stage and do that i fell in love with it and so it wasn't because i was watching people on tv and going i want to do that it truly i fell in love with acting because it was an outlet for me to communicate things that i did not feel comfortable communicating in my own life i think i've talked about it before i'm not the most emotional person like empathy was not something that has come easy for me it's been something that i've worked on and that due to circumstances in my life i have been forced to understand at a younger age i think than a lot of people um and acting was a medium for me to reach people to tell stories to express the things that i was too nervous to express in a very cheesy artsy way uh so i started doing theater i loved it i just kept doing it and then i had a management team when i was doing professional theater and they were the ones that said hey you should go to l.a and you should do film and tv i would like we would i would be in our l.a apartment and i would be auditioning for tv shows and my mom would have to like pull them up on youtube so i could see what they were and i would have no idea because i would never see that before i remember had to shake for criminal minds once had no idea that that was actually a show um so it truly was it just came from a love of stories and being like an emotional outlet for me it's kind of a weird you know circumstance but i think it ended up serving me well because i never compared myself to the people that i saw on screen i wasn't trying to be like any certain actress um and i didn't really have like my sights set on like i want to be like this or whatever it was just me being brett having a good time which is kind of all you can hope for in a career um let's see um isaac you bring us the community we need we may be here to support your channel but your channel lifts us up and brings us together uh p.s bread and omelet when uh thank that is so sweet thank you i like okay so when we hit a million i uh i saw this one comment and it was like uh yeah it's a million subs but these are like a million people that you've made smile which is again like so cheesy and i was like oh my god you're gonna all make me emo but it really it like genuinely means a lot to me and as somebody who loves telling stories and like communicating with people me being able to reach you guys it's it means the world to me um and i do know amela i'm friends with her we should definitely do something at some point um i think she's in europe right now on a trip but um anyway i do know amla let's see what does the 1776 represent on your necklace american revolution baby 1776 when america was founded let's see um i am a 27 year old truck driver and i love watching your content keep up the good work another person that is keeping this country going we need you we love you thanks so much devin um john says gender assignment operations should be banned because they violate the hippocratic oath to do no harm also i made two new pins in photoshop and had them printed they are on my truth social john bristol yeah guys john has been uh branching out i don't know if you've been branching in but this is a new thing if i remember correctly because i think on an earlier stream you had been commenting out like how you were getting into graphic design but you can go check out john on truth social if you want to see his pins um but yeah that is a lot of people make that argument because it is absolutely ridiculous especially like watching the videos from like the philadelphia children's hospital i think that's what it was um and then the boston children's hospital elizabeth have found a few other videos from different hospitals where they are talking about literally sterilizing and cutting up small children and you put that next to the oaths that they have to take it's like this just really does not seem aligned um let's see um what is this joe said i too i'm watching you all working as a software engineer i appreciate the fact that i'm like background noise for you guys is that like comforting in a way i don't know um here's another here's a random fact about me i cannot listen to other people talk while i work i i have to watch like our daily wire podcast i can't listen to them because i get way too distracted because i want to either focus on the podcast like i have to just like be sitting on my couch listening and then i get bored um i have to have like multiple things going on i remember the only way that i really became good at like understanding and dissecting and have an appreciation for shakespeare this is like a very weird and academic you know thing is i had to be reading the plays while like watching a you know a live version of them it's just like i have to have multiple senses going at once um so i appreciate the fact that you guys are watching or listening to me while doing something else because that's literally not something that i can do i can't listen to streamers i can't even do audiobooks as much of a nerd as i am it would be so productive for me people to walk around listening to books i would get so much more reading done uh i i get so distracted i miss hugh i have huge plot holes so anyway um does not work let's see um thank you so much bond color i appreciate it um uh i appreciate you uh oh my god you have made it so that i now can't ever attend a buffet without checking my belt pants first you guys know what he's talking about it's when i was younger um my skirt fell down at a indian buffet and i couldn't do anything about it because i was holding my tray of tiki masala um etsy oh my god amir guys amir is in the stream right now hello i love you i wish i could see you this week amir's going out of town and so i can't see him for a couple more weeks um amir said what advice would you give to your 18 year old self love you love you too um also if you've not gone and seen our shocking truth episode go check it out because it was super fun god okay um i'd probably say so i was it's kind of weird because i'm only a couple years like distant from being 18 but i do think a lot has happened in those two years um i was graduating college at right about 18. and the advice that i would give that i actually did receive um was take as many risks as possible i was very very scared to break up the routine that i had had for basically my entire adolescence and the plan that i had in place i am somebody that plans like 10 years in advance if i could have my life written out in my like hourly planner i would love it i'm not a spontaneous person and the the last two years have forced me to be so flexible i have moved six times i have left i have lost friends i have left behind friends i moved across the family from my family or i moved across the country from my family which i never thought i would do because we're all super close and i planned on basically living in a commune with my mom and my brothers um and so i was uncomfortable for a lot of the two years and i don't think i really reveled in that at all and i think that looking back i think there was a lot of growth that i'm doing now that i could have done in that time of really being like aware and sitting in the discomfort which i'm good at doing now um and i also think and i'm good at doing this but take as many risks because like at 18 you have your entire life ahead of you i still have my entire life ahead of me at 20 and i think that i got a bit in my head before taking the leap to like do all of these things of saying like oh this wasn't what i planned this wasn't what i went to school for this wasn't what i was intending to do when i was 12. like i'm i'm stopping acting after 10 years why am i doing this um and just kind of reaffirming that to myself two years ago and saying this is okay um so i would that would be my advice um like even okay this is sorry i don't know if i've told daily wire dm'd me that is how i ended up here uh this will be my last story and then i've got to get off of here but i opened up my phone i was working as a copywriter and a marketing strategist young americans for liberty which is a fantastic organization uh it's the former ron paul organization and i was working with them and i got this dm from daily from the daily wire account saying hey we've seen your stuff and we would love to talk with you about doing a show and i was like you've got to be like kidding me like this is not real they're trolling me i had 4 000 followers literally and i had just been tagged in prageru things and had sort of done some of my own videos but nothing big at all um i was not even known from acting really because i had been acting a lot in last few years i was living in boise idaho and i did nothing about the dm i responded i gave my email and i was so freaked out because i had just moved to boise i had just gotten a new house i was working at this new job at an organization that i really really cared deeply about it was close to my mom and it was i did not even want to submit the video of me react they had sent me a few different things to react to to see like how i would do on camera and then i had a meeting with like kobe and gracie you guys have seen them on camera um to kind of talk through this before they offered me the job um and i didn't i spent like two weeks and i didn't do anything about it because i was so freaked out and i was going i can't i can't take this risk i can't take the leap like i just left la i'm finally settled i can't i was exhausted um i think i just spread myself way too thin i felt like i was at my wit's end i had taken too many risks and i just wanted to slow down and my mom called me over to her house and she was like i don't know what crap you're working through but she was like get over it you need to like pull up your like pull it together deal with it and submit this because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and i don't care if you are uncomfortable right now but you can't turn down things because you were nervous about like how am i logistically going to make this happen if it is if you feel passionately about enough about something if you feel like this is a big enough opportunity figure out how to make it work um and so because diane told me to do it i did and obviously it worked out for the best but i was at such an emotional site where i didn't think that i was capable of doing this and i was gonna get in my own head and get uh get in my own way so there's your anecdote about what i would tell my 18 year old self how i ended up here um and this is all like nothing that i'm an expert on i do feel like i'm sort of an expert on being flexible in my life because i've just basically been whipped around for my entire 20 years i've never really had a ton of stability um and so i'm good at that but i am still getting comfortable with taking risks i'm still getting comfortable with understanding like when i need to stretch myself when i need to like kind of revel in that discomfort because it's all part of growing and i think obviously i don't know if anybody really becomes an expert at that but there's your motivational speech for the day jordan peterson who's that brett cooper make a motivational reel out of that um anyway um i'm gonna finish up here but thank you so much uh ahead of the table appreciate that um thank you so much timothy tapia you guys are so sweet i like i love coming on here these are so fun um john you're awesome let's see i'm reading all of these now um somebody said i'm watching you while i do underwriting for insurance it's okay nobody likes insurance but you know what we all need insurance we all need it and so again you are doing something that many people cannot do and that is a necessity and so as a result we appreciate it um anyway y'all i appreciate you thank you so much this has been a ton of fun we will do more of these streams uh

having a Christmas party for my entire team but I don't have a Christmas tree yet and usually I go to Costco I do something really simple but my team was like you know what you should go you should cut down one of those Christmas trees or go pick it up at an actual Christmas tree farm and as somebody that loves Christmas so much it's kind of appalling that I've never done that before so that's what we're going to do today come on foreign [Music] that one feels weird to be out like tree hunting tree hunting tree looking when it feels like it's like 50 degrees outside this morning would have been great because it was literally 20 degrees when I woke up because that one already been bought that one's cute [Music] somebody bought it they took it from me nope [Music] [Applause] [Music] why don't they smell do you think there's something where like you don't smell until they they're cut let's go look at the pre-cut scent matters it's like size matter scent matters I can't I'm not I don't know yet thank you I'm feeling overwhelmed I'm feeling overwhelmed I can't I like this that smells like Christmas that's too big I think [Music] or this smells more like it but it's this isn't spiky that's what I like can't have Spike I'm only going to do pre-cut because I care about snow maybe this middle row [Music] this is so Pokey [Music] this one's nice here about this oh yeah this might be it [Music] wouldn't you know you know all right I found the one sadly I'm not going to be cutting it out of the ground because I want a tree that actually smells like a Christmas tree and I learned that Turkish Furs do not give off as much of a scent this also makes complete sense and I didn't understand it until I literally had to ask him but if you're at a Christmas tree farm and you are trying to like pick and cut the smell of Christmas trees often comes from the sap which again makes total sense but I didn't think about the fact that that would be you know when you cut the tree anyway okay so I'm not actually going to be cutting it I just need to get it away from what is holding it down this ah yeah new tool [Music] s nice okay so they're putting my tree on top of my car I also picked out a wreath but then they told me because this is like a event experience thing there's a playground and it's for adults too he specifically said we have an adult zip line so I'm gonna go do it obviously what else would I be doing at a tree farm and if my team is new with me they're all fired [Music] thank you this is my like gymnastics [Music] here you go I thought you're gonna do one oh no no that was another life special thank you to Wildwood Christmas Tree farms for having us out here today it was tons of fun I sadly did not get to cut my own tree but I think I got The Perfect Tree for me I'm gonna go home and decorate it plus having an adult playground who's asking on the cake all right see you guys next time before you go make sure that you like this video if you have not

"WIaTkrpDGRA": "hello everybody happy wednesday i almost had a moment there where i wasn't actually sure what day of the week it was and so i paused anyway hello what the heck is egg my sexuality is egg you guys are going crazy is this the new corn i have somebody who's always in my lives who has corn and everybody does corn emojis oh my god now we're doing other things guys this is crazy somebody just said can we spam johnny depp yes that's what i wanted to chat about first and foremost is that johnny depp won on all accounts of defamation he won 15 million dollars and then there's a bit of a stipulation because amber heard technically won two million dollars but it wasn't on a charge against uh johnny depp if you remember correctly her counter suit was involving johnny depp and his agent because she felt like both of them had defamed her when they were responding to her defamation reminds me of the uh michael scott sip snap sip snap snip sap back and forth back and forth back and forth literally them anyway uh so she won two million dollars from him so that will probably come out of that 15 million dollar fund but guys justice was served uh this this has been a whirlwind of six weeks i feel like so much of my content and just content on the internet has been you know surrounding johnny depp and like i've said before i wasn't angry about it because i did feel like it was bigger than celebrity gossip it was the destruction of the metoo movement it was putting toxic femininity toxic feminism in the forefront of uh you know the national conversation i think it's incredibly important and i don't think johnny depp was doing this for the money the guy is loaded and obviously his career his career was ruined so we did lose millions of dollars over the past six years after this you know op-ed first came out but he fought for this trial to be live-streamed he sued her publicly um so that he could clear his name so regardless of the money that he won he has won in the public courts i hope that he gets some semblance of a career back because he deserves that i hope that his family can get back on track um but let's see pork chop sandwiches thank you joshua that was weird there you go it's a reference to one of my latest videos where i reacted to old memes it was really funny my oldest brothers my brothers are 12 and 14 years older than me and so my oldest brother is closer to my wonderful producer's age over here and it's okay i'm calling you old i'm calling you old anyways my brother immediately texted me and he after we watched that episode and he was like oh your producer's so sick we would get along so well he picked all the best memes these are the memes of my childhood so anyway they now have a relationship through me and are have a budding best friendship my brother actually sent me an email thread um an email thread with uh different links to other memes that i need to reference it's literally like my beginner tool kit like i'm now a walking urban dictionary and i have to use these ancient memes to reference around sheller is what my brother said anyway so yes pork chop sandwiches um we are best friends now via pork chop samus you sound like me guys one thing that you don't see i'm listening to myself and there's a delay on myself so i was confused it's poor chop sandwiches i think that you're just having a brain aneurysm listen here's the thing one thing that you don't see on comment section is that i am a chronic mispronouncer is that a word i do chronic mispronunciation there we go um and so there will often be we don't do a ton of like like i don't run through the show multiple times it's like one and done it's very off the cuff what you see is basically what you get but the things that i do have to redo is that i will sometimes be going on this tangent and i will be going um you know a million miles a minute and i'll get to it i'm making like a badass point i'm on fire and then i screw up like i'm the most basic word there was something a couple of weeks ago that i was so confident on and there were a bunch of comments people were like uh brett you pronounce that very incorrectly and apparently nobody on my team got it either but i've been my mother tells me and uh what was the word i don't want to say it pernicious i think i said predict and it's actually pretty pernicious oh isn't that it but we had a discussion about we had a discussion about it and both of us were like uh i think it's fine anyway any who um oh it wasn't actually my mother who said this it was a family friend um who texted me after to be like brett it was pernicious it's not ridiculous and he he you flattered my ego by saying um it's often the people that read the most that mispronounce things because i i see as i read things i have a way of like you know pronouncing them or whatever because i read a lot so apparently i read more than i talk to people i guess it's pretty on brand but anyway where was i going with this i had a whole thing oh i was making fun of you for mispronouncing this full circle happy wednesday everybody okay hold on um this is the generations uh o.j simpson trying to fight me on this i won't fight you on this i think you're absolutely correct i'm just waiting on this to be made into a mini series like the o.j simpson one uh let's see favorite songs genres and novels um i don't really know what genre i like but i've said it before favorite band is banned camino i also listen to valley a lot 1975. um that sort of it's like pop but like semi-indie but also semi-mainstream i've also heard that it's just called like stomp and holler not really sure but that kind of stuff and then novels i don't really have a genre but i have time periods that i really like so i like regency and kind of like gothic both of those uh really really interest me victorian era stuff um i also really like american novels around the time of the great depression like the turning point from the growing 20s to like going into the great depression i think that's really interesting you guys are getting my like academic answer because i was an english major but just in terms of genres um i do love like very intelligent mysteries not like a summer beach read but like agatha christie type stuff like psychological um like classic murder mystery things um and then just like a good like dysfunctional family drama that's like a very broad genre but kind of relate to those novels a bit but i think that those like family stories are very overrated but i think that you can suck a lot out of you know like the complexity of a family especially you know you know the dysfunctionality of it i think you can learn a lot and i think that those stories are incredibly compelling um and are very gut-wrenching and emotional so i really like those just like a broad genre let's see you just have a lot of verbal typos that's cool thank you ben i appreciate that i think my my writing is very clear usually although the other day i wrote a caption and i said i always say i said something like oh i came out of the shoot like this and i wrote shoot instead of shoot like shoot rather than like coming out of the chute um so sometimes i do slip up but i do i was raised by a woman who was you know like a grammar policeman grammar freak not freak i love you mom hi um but who really hammered all that stuff in we used to have a jar and probably should have it these days because i realized that i'm slipping up on some of this but we had a jar where my brothers had to like oh my god i just did it again this is it's all about using the word like incorrectly so instead of using it as a comparison using it as a filler word i was like doing this i was like doing that which my generation uses all the damn time we had jars where we would have to put in a quarter or something like that whenever she caught us using the word incorrectly um in its improper function so anyway i think i like to think that i communicate effectively and write effectively but i do mispronounce things and so that is literally the biggest blooper that we have i've had a lot of people say hey rick can we like do bloopers it's literally just going to be a compilation of me messing up words like me on like like i said working a million miles a minute and then i the train just halts because i screw something up let's see um what it says uh one word that i hear mispronounced all the time is etc everyone always says etc one of the things that really irks me that is understandable i have heard that thoughts on hip-hop are your opinions on it the same as ben i personally enjoy 90s hip-hop for his political message and urban intelligence that sounds super cool i probably would like it from a from like a content point of view and i would appreciate that purely just on like my listening enjoyment i don't really jive with hip hop uh i will listen to it in the car one of my best friends um listens to a fair amount of hip hop well honestly a fair amount of my friends do so i will i will sit and i will enjoy it but it's never something that i will actually turn on but i don't hate it i don't think it's like disruptive obviously i did it again like i said like i'm gonna have to put 25 cents in the jar for my mom uh anyway it's not something that i would turn on on my own accord johnny got a mega pint of justice today hell yes he did joe jersey let's see it uh it's just a joe biden moment nothing to worry about unless you suddenly feel the urge to ruin a great nation there we go that's what i'm going to call it it's not a brain fart it's just a joke but it's a joe biden moment do you have the names of novels you can recommend i have a highlight on my instagram story it's called get lit and i used to do this whole series where on fridays i used to read a book a week which i'm working on i'm working on getting back up to that but this job is demanding for sure and i also was in the reading zone while i was still in school so i was just like cranking out books i literally read a book a week so i would review every book that i read that week and that i would get you know book recommendations from other people if i had read the books i would sort of talk about them so there's a ton of recommendations in there fair amount of them are more politically leaning because i was reading a lot at that point but a lot of the books that i was responding to that my followers were sending in are non-political and most of the ones that i talk about i can recommend so go check that out but okay put you guys can chat i'll look at the main chat real quick um for this if i put together like a goodreads i don't know if people still use goodreads or if i had a book list i don't know if people would look at it or not but i've been updating mine so i could do something like that because people do ask me this all the time so if you want that let me know and i'll link it up but let's see oh my god i was gonna read all of this uh johnny depp stuff and you guys keep sending these in which is great i do love answering questions but i do need to get to the statements that they both wrote because they're wild uh where's your subjective i'm from texas so i should know uh michael says do you like prince um i i'm kind of ambivalent like i i just said like again sorry mom i love you i have to do that every time i say it now i'm so in my head at this point uh again it's not he's not something that i would turn on just because i like him but when i hear his music i don't want to turn it off it's just not something i would usually go for let's see do these super chats go directly to you or does daily wire uh get a cut they go straight into the uh comment section fund and it's you know split up between uh our team we have a whole group of people who work here for this show let's see mega pint time yes does your nose need to be slowly wiped somebody did that last time is that from the amber heard trial why are people talking about my nose again this was a whole thing last week guys somebody said love like wide-nosed girls or something thank you anyway i don't know somebody explained this reference to me please let's see okay here's a down payment in the jar for like all the likes i used to like that like so many i blame shaggy from scooby doo like really bad lol like seriously i don't have that much money i do think that it a lot of that language comes from the television that my generation watched growing up and i mean i can say that but i i what was that word uh but i still speak like this and i didn't grow up watching television so i'm not sure i just think it's our modern culture let's see miss start thoughts on john versus hurt opinions i'm gonna finish that up because i got derailed talking about my mispronunciation and books and that kind of thing but uh johnny one justice was served i'm happy about it i thought that this was an important case as somebody said earlier it is the o.j simpson case of my generation somebody gave some crime novel recommendations for anybody else who was interested ronald said if you like crime you should try uh back of beyond the highway and badlands by cj box let's see yo what is this yo ben this youtuber called the tabernacle has a video about you and michael he also follows vosh all right i'll look into that cavernacle c-a-v-e-r-n-a maybe i'll make a response let's see people who think men don't like intelligent women likely haven't watched the comment section brad cooper sips unite i appreciate it thank you okay wait now i'm actually going to get into these statements so guys the verdict came out at 2 pm central time almost immediately amber heard darts out of that freaking room she did not want to be there by any means she got in her car and she released a little heartfelt statement on twitter with some little heart emojis she says i'm going to pull it up screen share all right everybody see this here we go let me act this out the disappointment i feel today is beyond words i'm heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power influence and sway of my ex-husband and it's not like crocodile tears in here and maybe like snorting the cocaine that apparently she was doing in her uh during the trial um okay crocodile tears i'm even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women it is a setback it sets back the clock to a time when women who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated it sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously give me a break i believe that johnny's attorneys this is the important part succeeded in getting the jury to overlook the key issue of freedom of speech and ignore evidence that was so conclusive that we won in the uk i'm sad i lost this case but i am sadder still that i seem to have lost a right i thought i had as an american to speak freely and openly ma'am i said this on my instagram earlier freedom of speech allows you to write whatever the heck you want you can say something that might be you know that might defame defame somebody else you have that right but the freedom of speech does not protect you from being questioned from being critiqued from being criticized for having whatever you put out in the world thrown back at you to defend to you know gosh i don't know it's just arguing that you can defame somebody and not face the consequences especially when it was truly with mal intent and that it was a blatant lie and not face the ramifications like what planet does she live on that is the most arrogant and narcissistic statement i have ever read also setting back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up could be like publicly shamed and humiliated have you looked like you are a prime example of why the me too movement has been absolutely derailed it started in 2006 as a genuine movement to amplify the voices of women and men who had actually been raped who had actually faced true domestic violence that is important because that happens every day we all know somebody in our life who has been assaulted who has experienced that it is sadly much more common than any of us would like to admit that is a fact however it got derailed in 2016 when alyssa milano made it into this trending thing hollywood took it over they made a whole non-profit about it and it became this political arm they were basically like lobbyists they were able to sway part of the legal and the justice system which was already pointed against men i mean have you seen divorce courts and family courts they are they are never in favor of men we just me too pushed that even further and i'm not trying to be some you know pick me girl being like men are better and we need to do whatever no it's truly about equality setting a precedent that one gender is basically perfect and will never lie and the other gender is a toxic aggressor is absolutely wrong and is dangerous and it's not a way for it's not it's not anything that a society should be built upon um and i do think that you know gender roles in the two genders having these binaries uh is incredibly important to a strong society anyway so that what that her statement that's just it anyway the most important thing not the most important thing but one of them is that she's getting ratioed to high heaven she uh is only letting amber heard fan accounts respond to her literally this person says i stand with amber heard here we go is this gonna let me do this queen amber best of amber amber her daily best of amber i stand with amber heard so really it's like only people that amber heard follows or mentioned can reply does she only follow her own fan accounts can we talk about narcissism the quote tweets are really where it's at let's see if i'm not logged in on this computer right now yeah i'm not i need to fix this i got a new pc to keep in the studio and i haven't logged in on any of my stuff so it's kind of been i need to actually do that tomorrow anyway because i'll actually have some more quote tweets for you guys but this is important um carter is uh one of the guys who is on um my team on our team here at daily wire and he has a tweet that as we like to say around here is doing numbers hold on just you have to read this and i wish i could pull it up okay it's carter andrews oh my god why is it going you guys would love carter to be honest he's sometimes in here like modding my chat and he's sick but um here we go amber heard will always remember this as the day she almost caught captain jack sparrow he's at uh 55 000 likes right now and he only has 240 followers so guys go give him some love that's carter andrews on twitter i just retweeted it so if you want to go see it and give him some love because he is blowing it up and doing numbers anyway this was not the only statement johnny depp also did a statement and i have not read it fully so let's pull it up now he did a version on instagram where it's like typed out in a typewriter kind of thing and he has his real signature it's kind of hard to read so this person kind of transcribed it i've not actually read the full thing so let's read it together and i'm going to get back and look here super chess because i know i've been distracted going on my amber turd rant there's all these memes that were coming out more like her [\u00a0__\u00a0] the bed stuff it was so good there's just so many fantastic memes coming out of that still i don't think it'll ever die that's like 2022 in a nutshell you know 2020 we had like the train wreck that we had was uh why am i blanking out tiger king tiger king those are that meme like the glory days of 2020 was at the beginning of coven when we all sat around and watched tiger king and posted tiger king memes now the glory of 2022 kind of the same time of year is amber turd means anyway sorry johnny depp here we go six years ago my life and the life of my children and the lives of those closest to me and also the lives of the people who for many many years have supported and believed in me were forever changed all in the blink of an eye false very serious and criminal allegations were levied at me via the media which triggered an endless barrage i pronounced that barrage barrage see guys i'm telling you of hateful content although no charges were ever brought against me it had already traveled around the world twice within a nanosecond and it had a systemic impact on my life and my career after six years and six years later the jury gave me my life back i am truly humbled my decision to pursue this case knowing very well the height of the legal hurdles i would be facing and the inevitable worldwide spectacle into my life was only made after considerable thought from the very beginning the goal of bringing this case was to reveal the truth regardless of the outcome speaking the truth was something that i owed to my children and to all of those who have remained steadfast in their support of me i feel at peace knowing that i have finally accomplished that i'm so proud of him i am and have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and the colossal support and kindness from around the world i hope that my quest to have the truth be told will have helped others men or women who have found themselves in my situation and that those supporting me and that those supporting them will never give up i also hope that the position will now return to innocent until proven guilty both within the courts and in the media there we go that's the statement dismantling the metoo movement this whole thing where if a woman tweets something if she says one thing if the friend of a woman accuses a man of you know of attacking or you know assaulting this other woman then automatically it's the truth no that is not how the actual legal system works it is innocent until proven guilty we must take these things seriously and not make it into some political agenda sorry here we go continuing aha okay i wish to acknowledge the noble work of the judge the jurors the court staff and the sheriffs who have sacrificed their own time to get to this point into my diligent and unwavering legal team love you camille vazquez who did an extraordinary job in helping me share the truth the best is yet to come and a new chapter has finally begun veritas the truth never perishes that's in latin incredible what a man i love it um hold on i'm going to go back to these super chats now these are both just great okay here we go um oh i love this oh so many hearts for uh for johnny depp i love this let me go catch up did um joshua says wide-nosed seems insensitive let's call it a larger intake instead my larger intake nose joellen joe allen says do you play wordle i have a 94 day streak muscle arm uh no i do not i didn't really know what wordle was when everybody started tweeting about it and posting their little squares genuinely had no idea guys i'm so behind on so many trends i think i'm caught up on like i'm up to date on what i consider the important things but there's so many trends and internet things that go by me and i'm just i look at them and i have no idea but i think that that's semi-good because it means that i'm somewhat grounded in the real world because i don't need to be caught up on every single thing so i think it's healthy balance healthy balance but anyway i have thought that if i started it i would get addicted once i learned what it was so no i have not played but congratulations on your streak i see you have stream what games do you play well funny you ask uh i don't game very much but i am a gamer now i am a newfound a new a beginner i am a beginner gamer baby gamer i have played half-life i have played portal i will be continuing some of those it was really funny i was going back and rereading some of the comments from my stream y'all some of you loved it some of you guys were just coming at me being like this is so brutal some people were saying that sheller needed to stop helping me as much and other people were coming to sheller's defense being like he has to help her see i said like again sorry mom saying he's helping her because he doesn't want to get so frustrated because this is literally painful yes i warned you guys i said i knew nothing like i was starting from ground zero so you asked for it if you're frustrated and if you say that i'm a boomer or that i remind you of your older sister playing video games or whatever it is you asked for it um and see cat tic talks with the statement incoming pretty trashy to invoke foe to justify defamation um what is foe am i blanking on something here let me know uh please react to uh sham sharma show global meme review i will look into that um and i will let you know what foe means i don't know if you are reacting against the justice for johnny or whatever but i'll come back to them forge vampires it's a game i don't know oh i don't know interesting maybe i'm missing something here anyway what is this is anybody saying anything else on it i don't know okay um why should we care about any of this women in the media are still going to defend evil women and claim they are abused when clearly there was mutual abuse in this relationship where is johnny depp's army of therapists um like i said i do care about it because even though yes they are both dysfunctional you cannot look at the trial and you know follow it and think that johnny is perfect by any means but i do not think that he was an aggressor and an abuser he obviously has drug problems he also he obviously has you know alcoholic problem alcoholic um problems with alcoholism he is perfect he is not oh my god i can't even speak right now he is not perfect by any means but i do not believe that he deserves the defamation that he got and the attacks that he got um and so i do think that even though this is one case it does have the potential to impact this conversation and this you know cultural movement moving forward obviously it's not going to change things overnight nothing changes overnight especially in the society but i think that he publicizing this uh you know fighting for it to be live streamed and being so public about his fight for truth as he was saying in his statement i do think it will give um men and women who have been falsely accused the confidence to come forward and fight for that and obviously i don't know if the media is salvageable i think that they will always be a lying uh dumpster fire but i do hope and i do like to be optimistic and i do think that we should celebrate this as a win um because maybe this you know like i said maybe this won't change things overnight but this is a step in the right direction and it does show me that there are still people in the world that do value objective truth and that are willing to say the unpopular things and uh you know in the light of political correctness and wokeness and social justice so i do think that there is a reason to care i do think that there is a reason to have hope so i choose to have that let's see dan got here late why did you have to stream when i was out with my miss hi james how are you uh basically went on a long rant about how i mispronounced things and then talked about johnny depp and amber heard hope you're having a good day um i'm doing another stream on friday so you can jump into the beginning of that one i'm not sure what we're gonna do yet let's see uh what is this oh no this is a setback for the fight against women let's make it more credible by lying about me getting attacked so many people believe i was assaulted women now yes i love your uh that probably took a long time to type out so i appreciate that let there be rock that's good but see do you know that umbrella guy in his relationship with the jdah trial umbrella guy no i don't know who that is was that somebody that was on the stand there's all of these different like code names for some of these people i've lost track of all of them let's see uh hey i love your channel and this is off topic but a great book uh missing for uh 411 there are nine books it's all true stories about unexplained missing persons and national parks oh that is cool missing 4-1-1 interesting okay i'll look into that that's creepy i do love national parks maybe i shouldn't read that that's gonna give me the heebie-jeebies um you should play slime rancher for your next game maybe you've been the one who has recommended it before but that has been recommended to me on streams in the past let's see okay since you are a commander personality type thanks for remembering reid i appreciate that uh you've got to play xcom and xcom2 to show off your commander skills no idea what that means but love it and i do appreciate you remembering my enneagram type from that video um let's see okay oh pretty trashy to invoke freedom of expression to justify defamation thank you okay that makes so much more sense i was like what is the video game yes it is i mean that it's an incred like i said it is a cop-out and it is improves an incredible lack of understanding about what freedom of expression is and what freedom of speech is and all that it entails but are we surprised at this point with everybody you know saying that freedom of speech doesn't exist or you know it's not important did you see what they were saying at davos where a bunch of those elites were arguing that we need to basically rework and re-understand freedom of speech because maybe it's kind of you know an outdated idea and you know a it's an idea of antiquity basically no it's not like it is the bedrock of our country and the ideals upon which we stand so get over it but yes it is trashy thank you for clarifying i appreciate that uh i don't mean to brag but i just want a game of solitaire in a minute in 43 good for you i appreciate that i've never played appreciate that i said good for you that's awesome i have never played solitaire i don't know why i just said appreciate that what is this uh brett 1v1 me on super smash bros ultimate three stocks final def uh destination you would win i've never played that that's mario right super smash bros uh mario's in it oh okay is that the one okay wait i might have seen um i had a friend who played games with gamer uh is that the one where there's all the different levels and you're kind of like fighting and then one will like fall off the little like ledges and stuff and you go back and forth and you go like this yep that's the one cool yes have never played i will probably lose but you know what i'm all for a good competition um daily wire stardew valley farm needs to happen is that a game all these games guys you tell me all these things you need to preface it by being like this this is a game brett because otherwise i won't know and i'll think that freedom of expression is a game can we please get a minecraft stream somebody said you pronounced this wrong it's seismic i'm telling you guys i can't do it i promise i'm an intelligent woman like i said it's just because i read too much and i read the words in my head how i think that they should be pronounced thank you very much also your country is weird af not gonna lie greetings from austria hey i love austria i was there a couple of years ago beautiful country we are weird af you're not wrong where's the starship troopers movie review oh sorry starship cooper or starship cooper what is starship cooper is that a movie that i need to review that's james how are you james starship troopers is a movie it's a very great movie oh and though and you were saying starship cooper that's fun i should do that for the cooper troopers let's see time to buy some honey that you can throw winnie to distract him when he comes after you guys yes if you've watched my episode did you see that winnie the pooh is being turned into a horror movie my god like they have the right to do that that's fine winnie the pooh is in the public domain i don't really mind but god it's so weird this entire society is so sick no offense if you like horror films but it's like why go after a beloved children's character and turn it into a horror thing can't you come up with something else that's not going to make me have nightmares i don't do well with horror stuff i really don't should i tell i'm gonna tell them about my recurring dream do you know about my recurring horror room that i had we're listening okay i think i might have told you i've told somebody on the team guys i'm really i'm gonna go deep here i i've had a recurring dream i haven't had it in a couple of years but starting at the time that i was four it would start out in the very first house my family owned in chattanooga tennessee and we moved into this very small house in a cute little neighborhood while the permanent house that we were moving into my mom bought one and then it was being renovated and ended up selling that one when it was a whole like real estate shebang we were doing big renovations so got this little house we lived in for a couple of years um and it starts there and it i would start dreaming and the house would be completely empty and this very very small asian woman and i like that's i don't know why it was an asian woman but like tiny dressed in all black with a bright red scarf big glasses kind of gives me what's the character with the big glasses and the bangs from the incredibles mrs whatever uh yeah i can't remember her name but when you're describing it that's what i was saying yes so it's that maybe it was her actually with the red scarf um and she would chase me and the entire dream was me running from this woman but she could teleport and i couldn't and so i would end up like downtown chattanooga and like at the flatiron building and she would be teleporting in no matter where i went and i would and nobody else in my life could see her and i remember one point in the dream i was like banging on my dad's office like door in downtown chattanooga in the bank that he worked and he wasn't listening to me i would go to my mother and i had to like hide in a cupboard basically to get away from her and i swear guys this dream happened all the time like it was recurring and then it stopped for a while and i had it years later i don't know if that's the reason why i don't do well with horror things because i had like nightmares but i'm also incredibly gullible and i don't do well with jump scare so i think that all put together uh is a terrible combination add in my fear of birds if you have a horror film about chasing people with lots of jump scares and birds go ahead and kill me now you can't like you would not if that was a maze maze at universal horror nights i would not survive my brother at one point um was very funny we were at universal studios and going through one of the haunted mazes and i was terrified and uh my one of my brothers was in front of me and the older one was behind me and my the one that was in front of me is my middle brother and he just wandered off let's read and he was just like i'm fine i'm just gonna go on so now i'm exposed by myself and i turn around to get support from my other brother and he has four teenage girls clinging on him who have never met him before in his life they apparently like ran and like screamed he was probably like 28 at the time screamed lodged onto him so my brother was taken by a bunch of squealing teens and then i had to finish it by myself and then we got out of the maze and they were horrified that they had been clinging onto this random man's arm and i think they like screamed and ran away i don't know how i got on this topic really i was talking about winnie the pooh uh anyway that is my whole stick about horror it is also why i will not be playing any horror games even though sheller says that i will be and that is torturous but i have a few months to prepare that wouldn't be until halloween oh my god somebody's talking about bird games come on guys let's see um let's see it's interesting how amber heard cites the 1a regarding her speech yet counter sues for defamation so only her 1a is projected speech also destiny 2 game is a good shout i don't have much on youtube but i do stream on facebook thank you real tribal gaming for putting game in there i appreciate it you got me but yes it it she does have this very one-sided view that only her you know first member rights are protected but again that is a very if we are going to be politically divisive right now um that is a tactic of the left where it is their whole ideology is incredibly hypocritical where it is and it's also a very elitist point of view where it's like rules for me uh or rules for the not for me where she wants her speech to be protected she wants to be able to you know say anything about anybody else but the moment that you speak poorly about them um you know all hell breaks loose it's the same thing where people on the left will constantly you know criticize cancel go after violently you know verbally attack conservatives anybody you know right of center and then the moment the conservatives turn around and say like you know we actually do have some you know criticisms of whatever the left loses its mind is violence it's oppressed it's oppression it's racism it's bigotry it's all of it it's like come on guys everybody has the right to say all of this like it might not be pleasant and i would like it if we were semi-cordial but one side cannot constantly just be calling you know you know the racist flag or whatever so yeah it's a pretty common tactic let's see uh i liked the one con under this video winnie the pooh said i love murdering people and eating honey and i am all out of honey ah that's horrifying that's just terrible i don't want to watch this movie to buy some honey that you can throw oh oh i already read that one but yes good comment can i leak any upcoming wire movies will you cameo uh we'll see but guys the movie that's coming up tonight 8 p.m eastern time matt walsh's movie what is a woman i watched it finally last night it is i truly think we had a whole you know celebration at the office today jeremy was talking about this ben um ben is in town guys i might be putting out something with ben um we actually were in the same room together you will see that sheller's nodding his head we're not the same person i'm i'm like bursting the bubble when we post this um so yeah we we might be breaking the internet today when everybody sees us together yeah guys the proof is coming it is the proof is coming anyway uh but the movie comes out tonight 8 p.m eastern time exclusively on dailywire.com you must be a member to see it we have a couple of uh discount what oh um we have a couple of uh discounts for memberships going on right now a couple for 25 off i think that they're linked on my twitter if you want to go check them out i probably should check that code so i can actually give it to you hold on i wanna make sure i'm gonna do actually could you find that the discount code in case anybody wants to join hold on wait here we go use um oh if you click the link uh in um if you go to what is a woman.com you can get 25 off of your memberships to be able to see uh what is a woman but anyway premieres tonight 8 pm eastern time there's a backstage live with all the guys right before it and then that will not be the only time that you can see it it will then forever live on dailywire.com but truly what i was trying to say before i went on my ben tangent is that i truly do think that this is the best content that daily wire has ever put out it is heartbreaking it is funny classic matt walsh humor but it is it is such an important conversation one thing that i've said and one of you know the thing that i admire so much about matt is that he interviewed people on both sides of the trans issue people who are very in support of it i mean the doctors the therapists all of that but he also interviewed people who were critics and he took the same approach with both of them he asked the difficult questions to each of them he never changed his demeanor depending on who he was talking to he acted more journalistic than basically any person that we have in mainstream media today i mean it is brilliant i highly highly suggest that you watch it if you are able to uh it isn't just an incredibly important piece of this conversation anyway that's my plug for our movie uh that is the most recent one that is coming out as for my involvement with anything i will keep you updated anyway kingdom hearts it has money the poo i'm guessing that is another game let's see oh you are literally describing edna from the incredibles yes edna there we go what is this uh untitled goose game is a game where you play as a goose and run around a town in convenient humans well

sheller he is back you were sick last week i was so he was back he is back he had the rhona yep i had that's embarrassing that's embarrassing i'm just kidding it's my second time there you go there you go anyway he's back he was moderating the chat from home so he is back on the mic bobby is getting a break he is outside in another part of the studio working on a video that we are shooting in about an hour yeah with a very good friend of mine that might rock all of your worlds actually i really don't know it is going to shock mine that is the only hint that you are getting you know you might have seen some stuff on my instagram story but one of my best friends amir odom is coming into the daily wire studio to do this with me i am so excited you guys might know him from instagram but if you do not follow him already go subscribe to his channel i think he's gonna start posting more soon he used to post a lot and i think he's gonna be back on the train uh but he has a fantastic instagram so he will be in shortly in literally just an hour so i'm so excited to see him so this will be a good way to distract myself um from prepping for that video alrighty so we put a poll on my community page asking what quiz you guys were interested in because i saw the comments and we were talking about the feminist quiz that i did i've done some personality tests and i am genuinely a sucker for online quizzes um i i always loved doing the oh my gosh i need to move this around hello there we go um i always loved doing the buzzfeed quizzes that was a big thing for me in middle in high school and that sort of thing but i did see some comments from people saying do some legit quizzes not the buzzfeed ones so i did jordan peterson's personality test that will be coming out shortly uh and then now i'm gonna figure out how much of a psycho i am and i have um i actually have the chat pulled up um on another screen because usually when i move from screen to screen i can't see your chat and that bothers me so now i'm back so i can actually talk to you guys while i'm doing this test um let's see if this isn't bred cooper back in front of a live audience if you don't want to be in front of a live audience while browsing the web protect your privacy by using code cooper on expressvpn yes guys it finally happened so nitrogen fume no name they're always in here talking about expressvpn doing that sort of thing i am finally officially officially sponsored by expressvpn it's very exciting because i feel like i am truly one of the daily wire hosts now because all of us are sponsored by expressvpn i'm using expressvpn now i did my first expressvpn ad read the other day super fun so anyway what we did we have peaked this is it there's no going up from here i don't care if i hit a million or anything above a million this is it so thank you expressvpn um okay let's do this psychopath test all right so here we go so it this is not a buzzfeed quiz guys promise uh these tests were devised by professor kevin dutton from the university of oxford he's a best-selling author and an expert on psychopathic personality so this is based on a book that he has written and i'm very excited people kind of throw around the term like psycho now it's like oh my god she's such a psycho whatever so i am actually interested to see what happens i have not looked at this i have no idea what's going on if anybody would like to take it along with me you can put in this url or just type in like kevin dutton uh psychopath quiz i'll give you like two seconds you want to pull it up we can do it together um somebody said can you tell embarrassing stories from your vacation please i don't have any really except that i got very very sunburned can you see that i've started to peel a little bit right now i have some makeup covering up my face but i looked like a tomato to be honest which to my credit and my brother's credit we went through with his friends like four i'm not kidding four different bottles of sunscreen we were out there for a while but i was lathering up apparently did not work so that was embarrassing because i thought that i'd gotten ahead of it i apparently did not and got very sunburned but i am pale when i was born my mom said that my skin oh by the way guys my mom is actually live on the live stream right now she usually watches it later but she is here with us live i did text her because oh she did not respond diane i know you're watching text me back she actually her cow had its baby we talked about this a couple of weeks ago the cow had the baby but i have not actually heard whether she named the baby cow or not and we had been talking about that so if i actually if she texts me back and i figure out the name i will share it with you all it's very cute i have some photos of it i should pull those up so anyway diane is here everybody say hi to my mom as well okay now i'm actually gonna take it i gave you 40 extra seconds so you could pull it up as well we can see who is a psychopath um let's see oh let me get these really fast okay anyway that's my one embarrassing story sometimes you just gotta be a psychopath shake things up a little yeah there you go that's the right attitude spice it up be crazy why not first uh time livestream big fan did you enjoy the daily wire board game i made and posted it on twitter lol here at the awesome work yes oh my god i did enjoy that that was very very funny if that actually could get made i would 100 play it um just to make trolling the delicate snowflakes a little easier thank you so much joshua i really appreciate it all right guys all right we're doing it we're doing it everybody pull up your quizzes okay see where you sit on the psychopathic spectrum oh god okay read each of the following statements and rate how much you agree with each one try to be as honest as you can oh this is five minutes this easy guys jordan peterson one it took a while i was filming for a hot minute okay see i you rarely catch me making any plans i'm far too spontaneous disagree i'm like an erotic planner i'm not somebody guys that can just do a spur at the moment like let's just go let's just go i'm like no what about the food what about my dogs what about my house what about all these other things and i've i whatever i have a feeling you're going to be a psychopath god okay well don't jump the gun here i'm just i'm just predicting now okay so that's what sheller said grade a psycho is that just because i have a crusty white dog that's part of it 100 all right okay hold on uh next might i want to go next what is it is it doing it to anybody else oh here we go okay i'd have no problem cheating on my partner if i knew i could get away with it no disagree okay if i got a better offer i wouldn't mind canceling long-standing plans it depends on how good the offer is does that make me a terrible person no i would say moderately disagree if it was something like absolutely exceptional uh if it was something absolutely like net like once in a lifetime maybe but usually i'm i stick to my plants but i'll do i'll give myself wiggle room i don't get bothered by seeing animals injured or in pain no disagree i do get bothered when i was driving back from florida while seeing my brother i saw what i thought was a dead cat a dead kitten in the middle of the road i had seen here's the situation i had seen a little cat on the side of the road a little kitten drove past it and i was like brett you gotta like go back and if it's still there you can pick it up i don't want it running around i came back there was an animal legs up in the middle of the road i was like dear god it's like the cat and i should have stopped earlier i can't believe i did it i was about to start crying it was not it was just apparently a like dead possum and that still is sad but i missed it the first time but it was gonna be worse if it was the kitten that i had driven by the first time and taken five minutes for my conscience to really hit for me to turn around anyway long story short couldn't find the cat disappeared in the trees okay it would be fun to drive fast cars ride roller coasters and go skydiving yes absolutely agree love roller coasters have been skydiving twice my car is huge and kind of a tank and doesn't go very fast but it'll be fun if it did i think it's okay to step over other people to achieve my own ambitions i would say moderately because i think step over is sounds bad but i also think you have to have a certain you know what is the right word for not competitiveness but kind of an edge to you to really i don't know some people would disagree with that i don't that's one thing i was talking with one of our execs here the other day about how a lot of people when they argue about like the wage gap and men succeeding in you know the workforce because they have these masculine traits it's like why do they have to be totally masculine if i want to succeed in my career i can be aggressive if need be and i happen to have more of those personality traits i'm not going to like stomp all over people to get there but i will be assertive i'll make it happen i don't like that there's not a middle ground here um oh they want to know sheller are you taking the test in the background we need to know if you're going to be a psychopath no yes take it pull it up pull it up pull it up all right all right all right there we go while you pull it up let's see um i'll answer some questions while we do this to avoid me having to answer this question uh brett you should look at the controversy uh concerning maya hawk concerning her music video it was pornographic the daughter of ethan hawkin uma thurman don't understand why sex was the foundation of the song i have not seen that um don't really even did not know that he had a daughter that was doing music and entertainment stuff so i will look into that thanks so much what are your opinions on technocracy what is that no idea hang on okay oh he's i'm catching up okay okay okay i'm not sure i will pull that up let me see uh if you were in a food fight would you throw a pie or squirt a ketchup bottle in their face or if those were my two options probably squirt the ketchup bottle seems more satisfying let's see hey brent chiller thank you for the videos i'm a 21 year old conservative male and it is hard going to college in this crazy lib era it's hard to be so outspoken about tried views without being an outcast absolutely agree it is very difficult and it's so weird that you sort of have to come out as not a lib on college campuses and it's just very very weird so i appreciate you are outspoken in your values whatever they may be i just think as in general as a generation we have a problem going against the grain and truly being principled and standing strong on any values regardless of where you land on a political aisle unless you are you know extreme far left and then you can say whatever you want people are just going to like blindly like clap like seals um so anyway many props to you uh she did say she has problems with empathy lol love your channel red appreciate you calling out the drag queen child abuse uh yeah and i want to be honest about it because i do think i have become an empathetic person i think part of that is me just being very socially aware and wanting to be a good friend wanting to be a good family member you know whatever but i also think you gain empathy through life experiences and i it was not i think blessed is the wrong word i dealt with a lot of family things at a very young age my brother died when i was very young i've talked about it before i had a very very turbulent childhood with just family stuff and because of that it just forces you to step back and realize holy crap i have no idea what anybody else is dealing with you know behind closed doors behind like what goes on in their family you truly have no idea and so i do you know make an attempt to empathize even if i absolutely disagree with somebody and don't like them because i really have no idea what they've been through what they're dealing with currently and so i think you kind of have to strike that balance so you can still be a good human and i have said it before and i was talking to my mom about this on the phone last night i do you know i will repeat the fact that i i i care more about being kind the nice i care more about having like courtesy and connecting with people rather than just blindly being nice for the sake of being polite i guess but it is something that i've had to work on because naturally i'm kind of like i don't really care whatever like emotions are not good for me i don't really want to whatever that was a long answer um anyway yes sheller is now taking the test let's see a leftist quiz brett be crazy in the results uh hey datadev how are you yes guys uh fans of the daily wire join the unofficial discord invite is daily wire datadev is always in here promoting it um so jump in there done the test doesn't give any results what good god all right well let's see this could be all a bust um all right i'm gonna do this one i'm very persuasive and getting people to do what i want is a real talent of mine i don't think i'm particularly good at it that's moderate need something middle ground my ability to make quick decisions means i would means i would suit a dangerous job i do not make quick decisions at all i overthink everything and i'm pretty indecisive in many ways once i make a decision then i go through with it but the whole process of getting there oh i go back and forth it took me like six months to pick out a rug for my living room when the people around me are crumbling under pressure i'm usually the one with the cool head moderately agree i'm often stressed but i think i handle it well but i'm not just naturally cool someone gets conned who cares they're asking for it conned karma i guess maybe i don't know i'm really to blame for things going wrong it is usually the fault of other people around me no i mean it depends on the situation but i prefer to take responsibility what calculate your test do tell something about yourself okay gender preferred no female i am 20 occupation oh youtuber just put actor come on well i know but i wanted to see if there was anything that was more specific but they're probably going to be like oh my god she's an actor she's insane um don't need to put that on the internet education undergraduate degree favorite news source where is the daily wire leftist rag prefer not to say prefer not to say what is this some bs favorite animal koala piranha whose favorite animal is a piranha is that any of you guys i'm sorry if i've offended you piranha is still better than crusty white dog do you see what i have to deal with on a daily basis my dog is so cute and he does not understand that rocky is an angel sent down from heaven to comfort me in times distress from sheller rocky is an insult to sylvester stallone no she is not where is dog okay puppy i guess i would do that all the other ones are weird favorite music oh this is interesting um out of these probably country what do i have to do go what is this [Music] mine's doing the same thing oh my god do i is it because it's not secure i don't know i want brave what is this guys anybody else get it to work unpopular opinion sometimes kindness means being an that is true yes because i think being kind also means being honest sometimes you don't want to just you know be mean to somebody for the sake of being mean but i do believe that being kind means being honest and because often that is in people's best interest um somebody says does rocky eat eggs raw yes she does actually she's on a raw diet she is of course she is [Applause] it is the reason why my large dog has lived to be almost 14 years old and pyrenees like are supposed to live until maybe they're eight or so uh-huh so rocky is also on a raw diet she's gonna live until she's like thirty and you're gonna have to deal with this rocky three so we've got a lot more life left with her and what kind of dog is it is like a poodle terrier mix how long do those live for um terriers i mean our old terriers guys how long have your terriers left my terriers my brother had one that lived to be about 22. oh my god okay listen that just means we have so much time for you to bond with rocky you're gonna be my producer forever okay this is very upsetting why didn't it says all done i don't like this okay what if i went back psychopath and this is upsetting mine view latest results what is this where is mine our survey i rate your big dog 10 out of 10 small dog gets a participation trophy though what did we uh do to deserve not getting an ar range day then on instagram oh because my brother yeah well it was pouring rain in florida because i am an idiot and i said sure i'll come to florida um in at the beginning of hurricane season and so we had you know pockets of sunshine but the range we go to with him down in pcb is all outdoors and so that was not high on the priority list i really did want to go sit on the beach with him so anyway did not get that sorry about that uh yes james you did tell me this is ridiculous should i do the emotional intelligence one since we were just talking about empathy yeah let's do that i hope they give me a result let's see what this okay okay fans wait but here let's do this uh fans psychopath scores most of them are men guys all psychos how psychopathic are the readers of the financial times daily star the sun that's interesting i want to see daily wire we're not going to be psychos at all because we're based uh the most psychopathic people prefer fish the least psychopathic people prefer cats what sheller's a cat man he's a cat man i'm not a psycho i guess he's on all right my mom just texted back she said no name yet for the cow i need to work on that mom we need to work on that um okay let's see i am going to do the emotional intelligence i haven't pulled up okay this is from greater good magazine let's see uh tell your producer that i would love your crusty white dog she seems adorable and loving she is adorable and loving thank you very much uh if it was running the whole time why did you go through four bottles of sunscreen because on the one day that it was not raining it did not rain on saturday until about one no oh actually it's it was up until three but here's the thing i love my brother but he put me through the ringer on saturday he wanted to go to the creek he wanted to have a creek day so we all loaded up in the back of my car got a bunch of his friends put all the food in the back and we drove from the beach up into panama city we were going out like in bay county getting to the creek and because it had been raining so much the water level was so high so all the places where you get your canoes and that kind of stuff was shut down my brother or being my brother was going this is stupid i'm just gonna get in the water anyway i don't really care so we had to go to an area where you could you know park and get in everybody was saying the water's too high the water's too high then my brother said all right let's just drive another 30 minutes we've already been driving like an hour and 20 minutes by this point let's drive another 30 minutes now we're gonna be two hours away from home and from the beach to go to the state park entrance where everybody floats that's going to be open we do get there everybody who wanted to float the creek who needed to rent you know canoes and that kind of thing had ended up going there so it was super busy and then my brother remembered by the time that we got there that because it was the state park you couldn't have alcohol there and my brother desperately wanted to sit in his float and drink a white claw so we reached we turned around drove two hours back and so by that time i told him i don't want to do anything else i want to go sit on the beach for however until it starts raining and then for the rest of the day it was raining we played mario kart and that sort of thing and then friday was totally raining that's my explanation for why we did not go to the range because for that little span when it was not going to be raining i wanted to sit on the beach and enjoy it there we go okay that was a very passionate explanation um first time catching live so many questions so little time uh is there a way to send you an email with all of my questions you're awesome uh know that this is probably the easiest way i have been distracted on this one because i am doing this quiz but once i finish with it i'll be here and can answer more questions then um i'll buy a code it's not a dog if you can drop kick it that's a rat okay well depends on how strong you are so is the definition of a dog relative to your strength and size that's a good code to live by really oh yeah that if you're a huge person no no the the other one the person that that said that that makes sense and maybe my brother's dogs are not actually dogs so my brother has two german shepherds in a doberman and they are very very well trained he's ex-military and so he takes no bs from them and i'm kidding when he was training them he could grab them by their necks and they would go whack down into the floor if they like did something wrong and they'd be like pinned down or whatever and they're so well trained now but that man can those dogs would go flying if he chose to drop kick them um he does not because he's not a terrible dog voter but so it is weird if they're very strong you would not be able to um okay do the political compass won instead i vote on the name calberta mom uh james says calberta should be the name uh i have done the political compass one we filmed it we have not released it yet i'm saving it for a rainy day for when i'm out of the office or something like that i need some evergreen content okay here we go let's do this oh this one isn't too crazy long how well do you read other people oh gosh all right you're welcome to join these if you want i'm on is it going to make me log in or register no i don't think so it's if you want to save them okay what do you think this is this face is expressing [Music] embarrassment yeah right okay incorrect fear really no the problem with this is this is someone acting yeah we're not actually looking i don't like this at a photograph of somebody actually in fear yes this is like oh my gosh pretend you are in a in a horror movie yeah they're they're basically making that emoji face you know that's weird 0 out of 20 i hate the fact that i'm already failing this face is expressing politeness she looks stiff this is not flirtatiousness that would be so bad okay politeness incorrect hat that's not real joy this is rigged this is rigged this is rigged this is uh somebody's saying cringe face i knew it was few people knew it was fear apparently you have more emotional intelligence than sheller and i do maybe this is maybe it's not us maybe it is us that's what i meant to say yes could be this is just this face is expressing constipation uh and just anger i'm now i feel like i am answering in the court like for what they want correct wow i don't think that that looks angry at all that looks like a toddler being upset um somebody says nugget my 15 pound jack russell terrier is taking great offense to this small dog discrimination we had the terrier that lived to be 22 uh was jack russell that was my brother's dog 22 years damn what is this somebody says name the cow vegeta because no one has something sheller understands i'm scared to read this out loud because i feel like it's so hold on let me see it sometimes i have to have him look at him before reasoning out loud but see how do you insert a pivot table in excel i don't know i don't i've never used excel i'm very bad at it my knowledge of excel is just going down into the little cells and i can just do the x and the y axis and that's about it one of my best friends though is an excel whiz she works in data and so she teaches people excel and that sort of thing and it's fascinating her one of her proudest moments is she can do everything without a mouse all that stuff do you know what that is well i'm going to disappoint the person who mentioned vegeta i don't know how to say that either but apparently it's a character from dragon ball z i don't watch so i'm sorry i'm sorry oh that was bobby that likes dragon ball z yes other producer he's not here right now but he would probably appreciate that let's see okay okay this fate what is this this looks like my friend's dad [Laughter] this face is expressing it's boomer face that can't okay well the head is down but that does not look like shane that's like happy shame sadness embarrassment amusement incorrect that's not embarrassment that's not okay well you don't have rubbing in my face people are saying it's vegeta all right okay this face is expressing uh pride probably pride and prejudice correct good gosh this is okay uh surprise let's see how fast yep all right here we go wow i'm so good at this now this face is expressing in contempt contempt yep wow i'm guys i am so emotionally aware this face this person this actor is doing all of the toddler faces let's do disgust yep all right this face is oh um wow she's flirting with me through the camera uh maybe that's how it's probably that right right yep okay interesting apparently when you flirt your head goes to the side guys that's how i do it oh you got your wife i did wow you just only talked to her from the side profile that's it this face is expressing uh looks like she just ate a warhead maybe um this is not that's incorrect pain no well i guess eating a sour candy would be again this looks like my friend's dad uh this is also looking like a toddler i think that this would be somebody like the fact that you said boomer face okay uh i have no idea what this one is i know what it is it's compassion no it's not okay is it is that like oh i'm empathizing with you let's see wow okay all right this face is expressing amusement right yeah yep wow i've only gotten 8 out of 20. faces expressing interest interest yep wow somebody asked how do you how do we send you videos to watch on your podcast um you can dm them to me but my dms gets so convoluted and messy all the times so make sure that when you send it send a message that says like four comments section you can also tweet them at me like tag me in them that's a better way um but those are the foolproof also tick-tock if you tag if you see things on tick-tock directly you can tag either one of my accounts and i usually go through and i can find them that is a good way okay this place is again with the toddler things maybe set this is a sadness yep all right somebody says look up your personality types on personality database to see historical figures famous human characters with your same type i think um gosh what is it what is the it's 12 personalities or whatever the myers-briggs site whatever when you ever can't even speak when you google myers-briggs the first one that comes up they have that sort of thing but i'll look that up because that would be cool let's see he says side profile can't believe queen liz has been flirting with me all of my life on money there you go james exactly so he says good lord woman veggie okay okay there we go there we go all right somebody says hey brett he's a 10 but he doesn't like deep conversation thoughts um i would say five because if he doesn't wanna have you know a deep like if he's not just wanting to sit around and talk about philosophy all the time that's fine i think that i'm an intelligent person i'm pretty academic i would love to have those kinds of conversations but i'm also not the most oh i am a pretty serious person so if he is more you know lighthearted or whatever that's fine but i also would like to have that level of intelligence so i don't know maybe a five no idea there was a funny one today that i saw and it said she's uh ten but she's stressed every day i was like ooh that's relatable um okay this face is expressing oh is this desire that's weird i don't like that i'm moving on open open whip tongue sticking out oh god that looks like my dog this face is expressing embarrassment let's do that oh incorrect shame so okay face is expressing politent maybe that's politeness i think that one looks like the normal it just looks like somebody's smile this face is expressing oh gosh i have no idea [Music] yeah embarrassment i don't know why i did love this again looks like a sour candy this is maybe guilt i don't know indirect pain okay this face is expressing is that flirty again is she do we think that she is turning her head enough to the side for us i don't know why i was waiting for people's voices to come in and respond i sometimes do wish that you all could be speaking at the same time they'll just do a huge zoom call with everybody that would be chaos but i would enjoy it i would say it's either compassion or flirtatiousness what about satisfaction it could be let's try it incorrect no it's love that's what oh wow all right guys when you're in love with somebody you need to lo your lower eyelid needs to be tightened if it's not it's not really love break up with them what is your age 18 to 29 female woman oh god gender non-binary no um what is your south where's the southeast okay and what why do i have to no i want to save and see my results i'm not putting in how much money i make i can't do that oh my god it's not working what is this she's showing i got expressvpn what is this name for cow marilyn monmouth what is this um oh my god wait what is something's happening do you see that it's like the bars on there all right will you pull me off of the screen real fast so i can actually answer this we won't let me go through without it um let's see okay is anyone surprised that the female ben shapiro is great at segwaying into ad reads uh it is harder than i anticipated and now that i've gotten myself into it i is something that i kind of have to keep up it's like oh brett is so you know i get all these comments it's like oh i loved that that was so fun that was so funny and now i feel like the pressure is on that it's like oh god we sit in here and it's probably the hardest part of doing the show is figuring out where i want to slip it in and sometimes it comes like today was pretty natural i think like i didn't even tell sheller when it was i was like oh this will work um but sometimes it's very difficult because they're two completely incompatible stories or i don't really want to attach the sponsor to something that i'm talking about if i'm talking about like an absolutely gross person or a terrible situation i never want to be you know like well you this person needs clear skin so it's kind of delicate to figure it out um okay let's see um is this actually gonna give me i'm not gonna sign up for your newsletter oh i didn't even need to do that it just gave me my number score 12 out of 20 not bad average reading expressions apparently i need to improve my emotional recognition skills with practice i'm not going to sit on this website and practice my emotional skills no i'm not at all um i got 17 out of 20. how are you more emotionally intelligent than i am i don't have a crusty white dog we're really going back to that uh okay i'm just gonna go over to super chat now and i'll just do a q a thanks for sticking with me with i'm very upset though that the psychopath one did not work because i desperately wanted to know how much recycle was this other one was kind of stupid but i was very excited about the psychopath um okay ooh where is this i need to catch up on things um okay please brett please like oh oh v why am i still not pronouncing it right i have no idea what dragon ball z is v gee like why are you laughing at me i'm not even gonna attempt it anymore i will watch something from dragon ball z and i will figure it out but i am doing this for you i am trying to say it correctly for you but i apologize that my it's anime right my anime knowledge is not up to par i'll work on it for you let's see uh can i recommend a band called uh kaleo also let's see i will look that band up these people are either actors aliens attempting to integrate or robots what you may not realize is that these are also synonyms yes that is actually i do wonder if there is alien life out there if elon musk you know goes to mars finds life there there's aliens whatever i would love to see something where they actually try to integrate or what they think of us even just like our political system especially america's because i say it all the time but i do think that politics is reality tv show and i would love for them to see imagine them sitting up there watching aoc faking being handcuffed beautiful brilliant stunning and brave your ads remind me of the truman show that's a great movie sometimes i feel like we're living in the truman show people are still see i'm not sure everybody knows how to pronounce it because everybody is giving me different uh now somebody else is saying that it's pronounced differently this is i'm not doing well on here um pork chop sandwiches that's for you yeah um are you going to make a video about all the politicians getting arrested at a protest last night yes we filmed it today that one should be out uh tonight right i believe yep so that one will be out tonight we talked a lot about aoc also funnily enough they were the capitol police said that they were arrested but she aoc specifically she posted her arrest paperwork on her story and a lot of people were quick to point out to say that was a citation you basically got a ticket you weren't actually arrested you got you know brought into you know wherever you had to do that paperwork but you were not arrested so i think you'll have a different definition of it but yes that video will be out later we talk about her we talk about how prison mike surfaced at the protest and a few other things the memes that came out of that were fantastic uh the alextein aoc timeline is not something that i expected for this year but i'm also loving it let's see uh this has been interesting first you are a 34 year old boxer now you're 20 i'm 21 and i work at chick-fil-a so yeah that is i do get dms and or like comments on here and that kind of thing and people are going i don't understand like i google you and it says that you're 34 and you're whatever like i don't understand because for some reason there is a boxer whose name is brad cooper and he's 34. and are wiki pages or any of those weird auto-generated fan pages where it's like information about brett cooper how old is she where did she live that kind of thing um which are all auto-generated they have kind of i think they've gotten their signals mixed up so they will mix some of his information with mine so obviously guys things you read on the internet not necessarily true but we should all know that by now uh but i do have people say i don't understand like i thought you said that you were gen z are you lying to us no i'm not i'm actually gen z i'm actually 20. i promise um how will you celebrate one million interpretive dance like matt ps love that sheller is a cat guy getting all of the support um let's see vegeta did i get it right that i think steve you gave me if that is correct you gave me the best ex pronunciation pronunciation well i was going to say what do you call it when you space out the and you put it into uh phonetic yes yes it was the best phonetic example yes there we go um okay uh i am not sure how i'm going to celebrate 1 million we're working on it i want to do something fun uh i have mentioned before somebody on an all access live said brad if you you know when you hit a million will you get a tattoo i jokingly went hahaha um my mom immediately called me and said i'm not allowed to do that which i should not agree to doing any of that online but uh we are going to do something fun i'm not exactly sure what i don't want to announce it until it's fully set in stone i also i think in my head i have a bit of imposter syndrome not really with you know the work that i do like i feel very confident in you know giving you all good content hosting the show that kind of thing but with how fast it's grown it's taken me back just because it was not anything that i expected so i think i'm still wrapping my head around the fact that you know we might hit a million very very soon so i'm thinking in advance about it but i also am the kind of person that i think i still would get self-conscious about that and go oh like oh that's kind of weird like well i can't believe that's happening uh so anyway when i actually have something concrete i'll tell you guys because i do think it'll be fun and i want to include you guys in it because this really is not about me it's about all of us and all of you guys being here so i want it to be fun well we're going to get cookies in the office that that is the that is the most important thing yeah oh um whenever we hit a milestone we get crumble cookies i order a couple dozen it's very exciting because crumble changes their flavors all the time so it's a big team extravaganza the whole team hangs out and we eat cookies i actually did not get any for 800 because i was out of town when that happened so i need to i also don't think do we do anything for 700 no i missed the last time i think the big milestones are you know 100 000 250 thousand five hundred thousand and then you wait wait yeah i think the last one we did was 500 yeah but i do i do like any excuse to order cookies and considering they're on my dime i'm not i don't think it's a bad thing to be like that's true yeah ask people if you have hey can you order whatever so maybe i'll get some cookies to make up for those but i'm very yeah then here the office will be eating cookies um let's see okay what is this hold on i missed some of these i'm fully looking at the chat now so if you want to send in questions on super chat i am here and i will answer them i actually have a question for the chat oh so like i am just sort of getting into anime or anime whatever and i have a question what show is best to start with dragon ball z or uh avatar the last airbender go okay am i gonna have to watch these with you we can okay because i did talk with bobby on the last life and there were a bunch of people that were saying i needed to yeah yeah uh we'll see what people say all right i love that there's now an argument about the pronunciation of this word i also see my bangs slipping and it's stressing me out i just looked at myself for the first time the bangs are a very big thing with the show it is i do i do a check beforehand i make sure that they're all you know set in place if you guys are super fans of the show just keep an eye of on her bangs like the continuity of the bangs during the episode they might shift yep on occasion so they'll be sheller just pointing at my forehead being like fix it there's a shadow already okay if elon musk makes it to mars creflo dollar will have to find a way to preach the martians the prosperity gospel uh let's see do you think the psychopath one fails on purpose to turn you into a cycle when you can't get your results christopher you might have hit the nail on the head is that how you say that i think i said that so slowly that i might have messed up the phrase but christopher you might be absolutely correct that is the better way to say that um because it is turning me into a psycho uh if you want another quiz you can go on i side with quiz i don't know what eyesight is i'll look that up do you know what that is oh gosh this moved sometimes every once in a while it goes and the chat moves okay so red i'm a conservative on the autism spectrum do you have autism add adhd ocd or any other condition um hi ian thanks for being here i do not or at least nothing that has been diagnosed i guess and there's a lot of people that they might live with that but it has not been i've not been prescribed anything for anything like that have not been diagnosed um i was in there this is on a different kind of spectrum but i was in therapy for depression and anxiety for a fair amount of time when i was in middle and high school um but no i am not that i know of let's see um let's see what are the movies that made you want to get into acting thank you for the fantastic uh content uh thank you so much tommy i really appreciate it you know it really was not movies at all so you guys know i did not watch television growing up and that also i was not we did not have tv but i also did not watch movies i was a theater kid and i read a ton of books and so it wasn't really films and like i loved filmmaking and that sort of thing that made me want to act it was it's all for me it's all based in stories i love stories i think that storytelling is the best way to change people's minds to reach people to connect with people emotionally you know i love ben's you know facts don't care about your feelings that sort of thing but at the same time often feelings don't care about your facts we can spit spit facts at people all day long but if you don't reach them on a human level if you are not able to convey your message in something that is compelling that reaches them if you think about the logos ethos and pathos that you learned about and you know freshman year english in high school pathos is so important there's a reason why there are three of them and they kind of work hand in hand and you need a couple of them in order to really convey a message and convince people to persuade people that now i went kind of down a different rabbit hole but i love stories and i've always been fascinated by them and my medium that i always loved was books and then i started doing theater and that is really what made me fall in love with acting i loved being able to put myself in those characters shoes um it's kind of like the atticus finch quote it's like you don't really know somebody until you you know walk or put on their shoes and move around a little bit so i loved that being an actor afforded me the opportunity to do that i also think it helped me with my empathy massively going back to what we were talking about at the beginning forcing myself to have to understand a character's given circumstances and what they were going through huge so even people that don't want to act that are not interested in acting about trying to be an actor going and taking an acting class going and engaging in art taking an improv class it's huge i think for human development just being a good person so anyway long-winded answer uh all this vegeta this would be easier if we were taught the international phonetic alphabet yes it would be hey brett the psychopath test worked for me maybe try it again quickly also really love your content and wish there was more to watch well we're hopefully doing more what we are doing more uh so we are doing uh first of all i will try it again it might be because i'm on brave browser and they block a whole bunch of stuff so maybe i should try it on chrome that'll be it anyway we are doing a new part of comment section basically it is called off the clock i got the name from you all because i said i needed some ideas for my own version of like a nick at night or bonus content so we are going to call it off the clock we have done one episode that really wasn't branded yet but it's just basically going to be me doing the content that i it doesn't really fit into the normal comment section show which is very fast and news oriented social media news viral content that kind of thing so it'll be like the personality tests me finally really learning how to ride a bike i'm going to do i did the embarrassing stories which should be out soon i also want to do the bucket list thing and that will tie into the fact that one of my goals this year was to start working on my pilot's license so that could be a type of thing that we do but it's basically me doing the content that i want to do that doesn't necessarily fit into comment section so that will be four episodes a week four additional videos and it will mostly be coming out on weekends so that you guys have weekend content that's that's the goal right now dope so that is the plan and one of the ones that i'm filming today with the mirror that will be like off the clock and i'm very excited for that one it's gonna be wild okay um thinking of cows have you ever read the 2017 peta article that stated the drinking milk is the symbol of white supremacy yes god people are so stupid people will literally take a crumb and turn it into a crop a cup a cupcake a cupcake to push their woke political agenda it's really ridiculous see favorite black mirror episode striking vipers i have never watched black mirror so i have no idea it's a great show i've heard it's good there was one episode that i've been told to watch which is where uh apparently you have like an app on your phone and you um break people yeah that's uh nosedive that's the one with i think it's called nose dive it's the one with bryce dallas howard i think it's episode one of season three okay it's very good there you go i heard it went woke i haven't watched the most recent season so i don't know but that's too bad because i had heard that in the first couple of seasons it was actually not politically incorrect but good it was yeah very biting social commentary all right guys my mom texted me hello mom she said tell that person that we have a beautiful sheep who is named marilyn monroe i think over the person who said marilyn monroe what did you say monmu maybe i think that was what the idea was anyway so we do already have a sheep that's in maryland that's a good point mom okay oh my necklace keeps shifting how to make brett go insane challenge her to become a leftist tic talker for a day i would actually love that that would be very funny i could dye my hair for a day actually no mom not gonna do it promise i'll just put on a wig fake piercings i did have somebody dm me and say or they posted on their story and tagged me in it that's another good way for me to see stuff if you post on your story because it automatically pops up for me um i said you should do a goth makeover and get your family's reactions so mom if you randomly get a facetime call from me in the next couple of weeks at work pick up and i might look insane and i'll be recording your reaction um what do you call it when you mix alcohol in american literature tequila mockingbird there is actually a book and it is written by somebody who i know tim fetterly um he wrote a book called tequila mockingbird and it is a book of literary inspired inspired cocktails if that you are into that sort of thing go check it out because it is very nerdy and very fun let's see when you hit one million cosplays ben shapiro and host the show or go out in public and ask people what they think of ben shapiro that would actually be very funny man i'm coming to florida i'm taking over the show he's in israel right now he's in jerusalem speaking at cpac israel which is very very cool and it was very really sweet i watched part of the speech and the crowd was so excited to have him here or have him there it was very fun uh the hoover dam is having a fire crisis i did see that video that was insane i don't know is it a fire or was it an explosion maybe those are sort of interchangeable but i did see the video of the explosion i don't know of anything else going on let's see thank you so much g raven and [Music] oh guys all right we have a birthday here we go hey brett it is my brother jake's birthday today could you wish him a happy birthday happy birthday jake your sister erin she is the greatest sister i hope you know that i hope you have a wonderful birthday have a ton of fun i hope you eat cake go get to hang out with your friends everybody wish jake a happy birthday in the chat uh dragon ball z are two great starters oh dragon ball and bleach are two great starters for you sheller that's what somebody said okay uh opinion on the hunter biden search history leak is that connected to the icloud leak i haven't looked into his search history or anything like that i've been slowly keeping up with everything um i don't know enough to say whether it is all you know real or not i'm inclined to think that it is but i'm not educated enough on the topic to speak about it but i would be interested i've said this before i'm not terribly interested in the videos of him being coked out you know drugged out whatever i think that that's kind of gross and kind of sad and i would rather focus on his you know international dealings the corruption within the family rather than just him being naked and gross i don't want to see that on my feed all right start with dragon ball z but watch it before dragon ball highly recommend it okay what is this what is this did you oh producer editor question did you see a rise in likes when you cut brett's smile off at the end of her be better outro and left it on her angry mom face um that's a good question i don't know if it's like a if that's like uh we we cut it off at a certain point or if it's when we re-recorded it and now it's different so i don't know um i have not been keeping track of that though so we can look and see get back to you guys but it's also hard because i think with how fast the show is growing it is semi-difficult to look at like oh if we change something you know how is this impacting you know the show in the long run we kind of have to look at you know just a seven day span of how are things performing just based on a few days ago because if we look at it over the past month it's like well we gained hundred thousand subscribers so obviously we're going to have more yes a month the way we usually do things is every week and we'll judge from the past seven days yeah so it'd be interesting to see so i don't know who knows thanks see see this is what he does we'll be filming he goes bangs push it back uh would you ever do a video reacting jokes reviewing jokes reacting to jokes i did want to do the video um it's kind of the video template i guess where is the try not to laugh challenge i have no idea whether i would actually be good at it i would like to think that i would be good because i'm an actor and i can hold myself together but depending on the video i might break who knows i think it would be better if i did the try not to cry challenge and you showed me a bunch of videos of cute little animals that sort of thing that would also probably be worse at that to be honest i do think that i am i'm not a stoic person but i can hold myself together really well but there is something about i guess it's just a woman thing maybe who knows but i do see videos of cute animals and if it's like a dog doing something it's like there's a vid there's a movie that is about kind of forget what it's called i remember seeing the trailer on amazon where it's the the dog's owner waits for him at the train station uh yeah the one with richard gere um yep hashi or something like that yes yeah i saw it i cried okay there we go i cried at the trailer and i hate dogs see it's not just rocky that he hates but i could not even bring myself to watch the film because i sobbed at the trailer so that's where ah that's where i land on things let's see have you ever heard of tyler zedd if you have i'd love and many others i'm sure would love to see a co-op i've heard of him but i don't know his content i'll look it up see you should do a segment on the youtube video there on first um i will look at that let's see start with avatar i also recommend i'm not even going to try to pronounce that shell or you can look at it it's from um sayani reese would you be interested in doing a video about politics in brazil about uh lula and ooh how do i pronounce this bonson bonsonaro dispute i did a editorial piece on some of it but i my knowledge is not very deep but that would be interesting i have not expanded much into international politics other than you know what america is directly dealing with but i will look into that because that would be interesting just even for my own understanding well scenarios very based though really yeah that's cool no idea let's see i think i missed a couple up here oh if elon does get us to mars and we do find alien life i bet you my lifestyle you see elon we'll try to have kids with the female aliens oh his dad already did with his step sister twice so why not yeah that family you know you look at nick cannon and you go nobody can have more kids in the cannon nobody can beat that rate and then the musk family it's like hold my hold my beer and watch us and i like the fact that nick cannon then commented on elon musk now having 10 children and was saying all right well i guarantee i'll have three in the next year it's like how many baby mamas do you have my friend but hey if he's being a good father go for it i don't know how you have the time for all of those children but you know whatever it's your life let's see my birthday was two months ago and i think that calls for cookies by the way i love the show in the content all right we're getting cookies because it was alex was alex's birthday two months ago that is the occasion let's see um uh what is the weirdest thing you had to do for a role when you were acting um oh well i think you guys if you watch the video where i'm reacting to some of my shoots the or scenes the one in heather's right my character attempted suicide and i was laying on the floor or on the concrete like that that wasn't weird but it was not necessarily comfortable because i was in that kind of contorted position for many many hours late at night actually early in the morning it was like 3 a.m when we were shooting that i'm trying to think of if there was anything other any anything else that was super weird i had to do some weird stuff in acting classes but most of my shoots were pretty straightforward learning how to fence was fun um acting classes are the worst i have you do some really stupid things in there i mean i love them but they do make you do very weird things my first kiss was in an acting class like your first legitimate my like first actual kiss and i was so stressed oh my god because you have to do it in front of everybody and everybody is silent and they're all watching you and god and he was i think it was probably his first yes i don't know how old i was coming like yeah okay so it wasn't like an improv no no no no no thank god no we were assigned the scene and the act teacher was like oh are you comfortable with this something you know me wanting to be you know whatever i was like sure sure ah whatever my mom actually might remember the exact age of it because it was a big deal it was very stressful i remember writing to acting class with tanner buchanan who is actually he's in cobra kai um and he was in uh he's the man which is or no she's all was that oh she's all that uh which is the new addison ray film so he was in that so anyway tanner was one of my really good friends growing up but i remember he picked me up and we were driving to acting class because he's a few years older than me and i was like tanner i'm so stressed i have to kiss this boy and um it was so stressful but yes acting classes are so maybe that was it i mean i got comfortable with it but that was very very uncomfortable that wasn't the weirdest thing but it was not comfortable by any means and it was not i don't think it was cute i don't think it was good i don't think i pulled it off i was so uncomfortable so anyway there's your acting story for the day um let's see a dragon ball z is more for great fights and avatar is more for the story so it depends on what you like i prefer bleach great fights and story oh okay so dragon ball and bleach are different i thought when the other person was saying that they were the same one there are some people in the chat saying that avatar isn't actually anime um i don't how like how is that not anime there's another question for the chat there we go you can let us know okay um oh yeah somebody's saying it's not technically yeah ooh somebody else said brett what are your thoughts on man buns it's your hair do whatever you want with it i don't think it's the most attractive hairstyle for guys but also it's not my life i don't care um it's douchey sheller won't give you his thoughts about it um fullmetal alchemist is a great one and cowboy bebop there's one pick one can't be you're going to the beach probably camping if i had the option and camping in like woods and mountains not on the beach i just don't like sand i really don't like sand okay let me catch up i had to go back up and then now i'm moving back down oh avatar is american-made that makes sense i didn't even know that that's how uh uninitiated i am with uh with anime i had i would have no idea i thought about uh my though when you say avatar i think of the blue people in that movie yeah yeah i don't know what that is that's why they're the crappy uh because they made a live-action movie of avatar the last airbender but they had to call it the last airbender and they called it that because of james cameron's avatar anyways that is one of the worst movies ever made literally the last airbender anyways no everything you said was just gibberish to me okay well the chat's gonna understand there are you shelter's here to connect with you guys okay um i'm a dude and you encouraged me to use skin care there it is i hope you use promo code cooper to get 15 off of your order with nimmy uh no that's very exciting i love that good for you let's see uh leah says i was homeschooled what was your favorite thing about being homeschooled other than getting to wear pajamas all day it's the best um i would say my there's so many things i loved about it guys i got into it i didn't get into a fight i just got pissed at some people on twitter because there was somebody a conservative who was saying hot take we should ban homeschooling and a bunch of these other douchebags jumped in there and we're going yeah like it's so stupid like well you what i was like you people like that is so against what you know the right wing whatever people who support freedom like how dare you get in between how dare you put the government in between parents and their children that is what we are actively fighting against every single day so i got a little angry then but anyway um probably that it afforded me just on a grander scale the freedom to explore and really dive into all of my interests i was not confined to four walls for eight hours a day and then was forced to just you know cram in my extracurriculars after i had finished all my homework and you know seeing my family whatever i got my schoolwork done you know whenever i could but the focus of my education i wouldn't say was primarily on real world experience but it was heavily focused on you know getting me into the real world i was volunteering i was playing a bunch of sports i was doing theater i was dancing i was doing competitive gymnastics i was playing tennis i was sailing i was i mean i was so so engaged in the world outside of school i had a huge array of you know friends who were different ages had different backgrounds that were not just you know coming from the same school district basically so i think just on a huge scale that would be it it just gave me so much freedom to explore and figure out what i actually loved and was interested in and that is something that i don't take for granted and that i'm very grateful for um and that's the fact that i know i knew what i loved and what i was interested in from a very young age and i got so many more years to develop those skills and to follow those passions and i didn't have to wait until i got to college or until i graduated to you know all right now i'm gonna go get a job in the in the field that i want like i was working in that field at 10 years old and it's very very rare for people to be able to say that and some people are going oh well you lost your childhood whatever i would not change it for the world i loved it so that's probably my favorite i'm gonna wrap it up soon here because i think amir might have just gotten here i'm very excited to see him let's see i'm wondering if we should have brett do a show where she faces her fears the first fear is getting stiffed by joe biden uh i've said it before really the only thing that i am afraid of is birds and that was i had a meeting on when was it tuesday was it yesterday yeah where uh our intern alyssa she's amazing if you're out there alyssa watching i have no idea i think she's in a meeting right now she did a pitch deck of new ideas for you know this off the clock stuff and uh live streams and one of the first ones that she said was brett does a show with a bird on her shoulder so maybe we'll actually do it she loves birds so she's excited about it but who knows um any advanced species with the ability of interstellar travel will see us as we'll see us as infant apes you are not wrong that makes sense yes let's see oh there's so much stuff about anime i hope you're watching this what is this okay good let's see my mom has 14 siblings one set of parents with 15 kids holy crap your grandparents are saints that is incredible um okay you have somebody saying it's not anime what is the story with the knee and the sweet baby gang is ben intimidating what is the documentary that jordan peterson did on mental illness i'm not sure the name of that ben is not intimidating he is very i was nervous being around him at first but i think just not because of his reputation but just because of how well known he is and how much i respect him um but not intimidating at all very very kind very very warm he

clock video we're gonna do a comment section we're actually gonna do comment section now where i read comments in my own comment section on the videos and somebody was saying you know i've heard terrible things about the political media world and especially how they treat women that sort of thing i hope the daily wire is not like that and i was you know with full certainty able to say like there are exceptional exceptional people here um and it has been a very welcoming environment with you know incredible mentors incredible people on my team who are you know experienced and confident and just very welcoming so just know that if you are a fan of daily wire if you are consuming this content or other content it truly is coming from very good i don't mean good like oh they're talented

rest of your wednesday and i will see you all on friday bye you", "9RSL-2Doh3s": "welcome back to the comment section you guys know the deal um i was looking at this chat and my producers were trying to explain it to me morbid time is that gaming no somebody said you said it was cringe a show um it's uh it's internet joke for the that great movie that just came out morbius never heard of it it's the jared leto movie comic book movie that's probably why i don't know anything about it yeah you know i hear it's really good was that sarcastic no okay oh my gosh i should just watch the trailer if it's going to be better than she-hulk then maybe i don't know i guess we'll have to ask everyone in the comments yeah they think it looks better than she-hulk guys comparing morbius to she-hulk what what do you think um let's see first of all i saw we talked about this last time i saw top gun loved it the only other thing that's out right now that i want to see other than our new film that is coming out next week with gina carano tara on the prairie shameless plug that was a seamless transition um i wasn't even attending that but i also do want to see the new jurassic park thing i don't even know if it's going to be good but i love jurassic park it's going to be terrible guarantee well i'm gonna go see it anyway i'm so loud in my own ears right now there we go thanks so much uh but i it schaller is saying that it's gonna be terrible everybody's saying morbius morbius is worse they're both cringe she-hulk has no muscles she at least has more muscles than me y'all in our all in my most recent all-access live actually i don't know if it was my most recent maybe the one before last which is we do these live streams for daily wire members that are like smaller and we go in depth with like more political and like personal questions that kind of thing but somebody was like oh could you like do a gun show cause ben always does like a flex and somebody said no she can't she has noodle arms and i've liked really taken that to heart like that hurt more than the person on here that was like you got a wide nose or whatever like i've come to terms with that that's fine the noodle arms even albeit it's true but i was like man like i used to be a rock climber and a gymnast like brett you gotta work on that if people are saying you have noodle arms let's see um sherwin says top gun was more than awesome that's funny that's good i like that yes i thought topcon was fantastic um brett please opinions on stranger things season four guys i have everybody's putting everything you guys are like spamming the chat with this i have bad news and i'm gonna get into portal momentarily um i have watched maybe half of the first season of stranger things is that bad it might be so i would have to watch the entire series in order to do that i know that there's like some speculation that one of the characters is going to be gay or something like that and so everybody's he's totally gay he is okay well fantastic love that um check that intersectionality box um but i i've only seen like the first half when did it originally come out before it season four is that like 2016 2017 i'm trying to remember who i watched it with i think it was like my like senior year of high school-ish friends sort of thing but i i know they were all super into it i tried to watch it could not get through it was not my favorite thing so sadly i feel like if i did i could watch it if you guys would like but i don't think i will have any opinions on it i mean that could be entertaining it's like i've never seen it before and i don't know what's going on season one was 2016. i was right cool all right that makes sense that makes sense okay um i'm going to pull up portal we're going to play for a bit and i read all your comments and you were angry at sheller for helping me so much and it's probably because he does not want to sit and deal with the uncom discomfort of watching me struggle and look like an idiot but also he's paid to be my best friend that's true so he kind of has to that's what i said i did i did a recent dick talk and we were like introduced it's like that um the full house intro and you put like funny captions over like what everybody at your work does or whatever and so his was like paid to be my best friend he's my producer but a joke because it just means that he spends all of his time with me working on all of you know comment section stuff this and as a result i do spend a fair amount of time with you yes yes you do and so as a result if i ask you for help i expect him because i don't want to look foolish anyway let's see oh my god okay do you guys want to hear this yes nitrogen fume you might have just one tonight noodle arms and a dorito nose i guess you really are a snack [Laughter] oh y'all it's good that i have a freaking sense of humor i'm not sensitive oh god that's good they blink and says stranger things is poo poo oh billdozer why why do you hate me i don't hate you did i do something to you i love you i don't know who you are but hello i can tell that my bangs are falling i need to push these back um what is this so dems are saying you need to be 21 to buy an ar i've heard ben say that you should pick a date when somebody is an adult and stick with it uh does this work for alcohol i completely agree you know i don't really think that bumping up the age three years is going to do anything but i do think that it is incredibly hypocritical and you know inconsistent to say like oh well they're they're mature enough to do this now but they're not mature enough to do this because also the dems are saying they wanted to reduce the voting age to 16. so it's like all of these activist progressive gen z's you think they're mature enough to vote because they're going to vote for you but they're not you know they're not mature enough to have a gun they're not at that age not you know they're not old enough to you know join the military i just don't think that we should be moving around this like age of adulthood pick an age if it's 18 if it's 21 25 at least be consistent that is the thing that is chaotic because they're moving it's the classic unprincipled i was going to say fallacy but it's not technically a fallacy but it is them being on principled and changing things around to be out of convenience and for their own agenda so yes i agree with ben on that 100 um uh as a conservative from europe the only u.s talk a conservative talking point i disagree with his gun ownership coming from a gunless culture i don't see the need for anyone to own them other than trained professionals like cops i do hear that from a lot of you know cultures where there are not as many guns i think that it is something that is so ingrained in american culture and you guys can jump in if you want but um american culture and history um that i don't real i could never see america without you know the second amendment um and i my personal opinion on it is if we look at history and disarming citizens when we look at you know socialist empire not empires but you know socialist countries communism the first real step for when those governments were able to come in and take over was the government starting to take away guns banning them that kind of thing um and so as a result i do think that they are important and at this point we are you know we still have the right to defend ourselves and i'm not willing to give that up yet but i do know that a lot of people in different places don't really see the importance of it as an american i definitely do as a woman i definitely do because i do think the guns are the great equalizer but yeah do you think it's like inherent in part of our culture i agree and that's why i'm proud to be an american nice nice were you waiting for that i've been waiting this whole time i love it okay let's see hey james uh i am doing great how are you i'm happy that it's friday it's been a long week i don't know how you guys i feel semi-drained but also not like i'm happy to be here but it's just been a long week um as every week is basically but we have exciting stuff next week i have another guest coming next week which is very exciting he is somebody that is in a world that i don't know much about so that's going to be entertaining uh and then in a couple weeks we have another guest also sort of from that world i'm doing lots of athletic things sports ball anyway so you're going to see those in a couple weeks so we're planning all that stuff i think it'll be fun uh anyway all right i actually am going to play portal i know you guys are being like whatever but i got distracted and was answering super chats i always feel bad because

figure out where what like i might maybe i supposed to end up in that room let's just try let's go for a ride oh almost you have enough inertia what's inertia like force um i'd say i still don't know where i'm supposed to land so so go through there but just from this ledge there you go oh okay i'm still up am i upside down now no oh i'm just higher up oh god okay um so now i want to be even higher then i want to go backwards probably there which means i need to jump again yeah make sure you press right click on this that's left click so look back up and then oh wait i did the other one's

yourself more running has never been my strong suit just in general when you hit w press shift as well what does that do it might make you run is it it's not shift i have to like touch a keyboard right now maybe you can't run in this game i don't remember okay okay oh yeah i'm gonna get back so do i i don't press this so i run and then i jump yeah you're gonna like right when you get to the ledge then press jump ah damn it a little too soon okay all right okay great all right this is gonna be the death of me literally quite literally ah all right backwards this is stressful and then i have to jump off of it yes go too living no i get nervous i don't want to be too late but i mean being too early is not helping me at all right now so okay do i you got this okay i believe in you yeah

little too late it's that jojo's song it's like it's just a little too late i don't know uh that's actually more from your era is it not real it was actually my you look super hyped today though you're wearing the white shoes so hey white shoes man makes me look cool uh michelle stars wears these like dad slip-on shoes so i've made fun of him for that but he wears white tennis shoes sometimes

wasn't gonna quit i have to save yes oh current game wow that was like an adrenaline rush that last one we i was like incredible oh did it not go not pressed escape oh and then i thought okay i'm like sweating hello i'm back on this oh no hi guys okay i just need like a second to breathe hold on you've been through a lot i have been i was in a testing chamber for god's sake yeah okay hello oh my god let's see um nitrogen fumes is the entire point of 2a so that i personally can live out my fantasies of being john mclean shouldering an m9 m9 let's say i'm 19. that's not the thing uh that's fantastic i support that you should play dying light one or two don't that um one uh let me get one guess on who the guest is gary v that would actually be entertaining you should play portal 2 with ben it could be hilarious we actually should see if any of the guys want to play games i don't think any of them do game i think all of you you ben matt uncle you guys should play counter-strike hello that is but i can do that i would like to see cleveland yeah play a game do you guys know andrew clavin oh that would be just precious 100 that would be fantastic he was in today that'd be great okay all righty ignore the ones mad you asked for help like none of them ever visited a game's wiki page before it give me a break thanks ben i appreciate it you're always on my defense all right given your performance please in all capital letters play doom eternal do what that is yeah she would get murdered in that game i don't think she's ready i think that's what people want let's see okay the theme behind the old valve logo was open your eyes close your mind but it also made it look like they wanted to control what goes on in the mind yes it also just looks like a plumber got murdered and a valve got stuck in his head i don't really i appreciate the symbolism who was it that said the symbology of something it was something i was making fun of but they were like the symbology of this it was some celebrity anyway the symbolism of uh that is very cool but i do think that it looks like a polymer was uh terribly murdered was that what's her face that said uncut jazz oh julia fox no somebody else that one is good though right guys you know her first the genre of her first book is just my first book instead of myself i'm cut jobs okay this reminds me when my mom tried minecraft wow you know what i thought that it was low when it was like oh this looks like my big sister doing it but now listen i'll take i'll take it people call me mommy on tick tock so i feel like here we go again basically uh i think the perfect game for brett is goat simulator does that mean i get to play with farm animals basically guys have you hold on i need to take these off for a second give me one

the keys uh so anyway this is exciting let's see uh james hey james again uh this makes me feel like trying to teach math to my younger brother you get so close i want to give them the answer but needed to figure out himself that's actually a good analogy that is um neurodivergent says will you ever stream at uh 1080p yes very soon i don't know what that means but that's cool i think right now we're streaming at 720p that's why i have sheller here to give me support in my video games and to help me with the all the other stuff um let's see you should play green hell it's a survival crafting game i will say everything in the game wants to kill you oh my god it helps if you understand real life dangers of a jungle well y'all know me just swinging like an ape in the in the trees so i think i'd be great at that um there was there was a time that was i mean i grew up like partially in appalachia on the side of a mountain and so i spent i was not in the jungle but i was the weird kid that was like i would just go sit not in like my lawn or anything like that but i had like a tree a very specific tree in like the forest behind our house and i would just go like sit there with my jane austen because as you know i was not playing video games i was not watching television because i was out loud in my house so i was the nerd uh playing with my imaginary friends reading jane austen under a tree in the forest so if that will help me with my jungle survival then i think i have a lot to offer let's see it's been a while since i've seen a human actually looking at the keyboard and mouse yes it's a struggle but here's the thing i actually anytime that i type on this keyboard specifically and i really only do that when i'm here in the studio and i'm like working on the show and that kind of thing or playing games it feels so different than my crapple and i said crapple for you sheller because you know i know you hate it but it feels so different i learned to type on what is this called this thick boy he's got some heft to him this keyboard your mechanical keyboard yes but i i'm not as fast on it so i do look a bit idiotic when i am typing on it regularly uh weighted companion cube i don't know what that is but oh was that my cube yes oh nice um oh the pain i'm proud of how far you got but right now i just feel sorry for when you get to the last level greetings from brazil love your channel thank you so much i appreciate it um let's see what are your thoughts on the capital riot hearings in washington dc for the january 6th uh i have not been following it i am going to catch up on the first couple of days over the weekend um from the folks that i've talked to thus far has apparently been boring and nothing eventful has really come of it uh i think that that commission is a bit ridiculous so i'm not sure but i do want to make sure that i'm kept up in the loop but i can't really talk on that right now but over the weekend i'll make sure that i have some info for you guys um how do we send you videos to watch on your channel oh my god the comment went away hello where are you um you can tweet them at me dm uh if you put like like in all capital letters like for you to react to or something like that at the front it makes it easier because i check my dms every couple of days and so it helps like filter out if it's something for like the show um you can also there's a reddit page and if you want to link stuff there i'm not a like an admin on that thing somebody else just made it but i could do something where it's like there's a thread if you want to drop videos in because i really haven't gotten something that's like a good system on tick tock though um i do look at what you guys comment and tag me in on tick tock so if there's stuff there you can put either my like new personal one i have a personal channel now channel um personal page that's redcooper with an underscore and then there's the comment section one so you can tag me in that and i'll usually see it so all of those mediums but i usually i've been using a bunch of like um shorts and tick tocks from you guys so i really appreciate it let's see um i would love to play minecraft for the daily wire reviewing music while playing raising awareness and music's impacting the mind singing voice acting telling people to love their enemies love it that sounds good you should create a channel like that or something that'd be very cool somebody said shoot a portal to the other side i hope i did that i hope i did it correctly do it for the free cake i don't know what the free cake is but i do love cake um this is so painful to watch that i'm starting to lose my brain cells that's me every day that is me every day i know that i'm so painful to watch i do lose brain cells i also make my team lose brain cells because i'm like guys look at this crazy person and like doing this stupid idiotic thing and then they have to be part of it so anyway um dad flip-flops annie thinks you're dogs and you're thinking all right sheller james wants to know if you wear dad flip-flops and he's commenting on your shoes and he goes and he thinks your dog is ugly weird logic

hard drive says 400 babies is that a power thirst reference yes it is i did a whole episode on me reacting to old memes that i didn't know existed like the best memes of the last 20 years basically it's what sheller grew up on um and so one of them was power thirst so the kenyans and 400 babies um anyway so yes if you want to go see that that was my brothers my oldest brother who probably plays these games his very favorite episode that i've done he texted me who was like oh my god your producer's so cool we'd be such good friends and then he literally sent me an email with a bunch of other memes that i need to like reference for sheller i need to be up to par on that because i have not been um but anyway so yes that is a power thirst reference indeed let's see if you play csid legit die oh if you play cs i'd legit dive cringe hard game to learn but it would be hilarious i don't know what that is but strike what counter strike that's the game oh okay yeah well everybody's dying of cringe apparently somebody said bring your scrappy dog yeah i know we're working on it i do need to come up with something fun i'll just bring her but here's the thing she looks ugly right now not not

smells she does not smell guarantee your dog's smell no if i if i pet your dog and i smell my hand i'd have to wash it like 10 times okay that's most dogs though no no no no that is that dog okay now the dog that actually smells is my 14 year old dog but that's just because he's like geriatrics oh god okay okay i'm just kidding i'm just kidding ugh uh will says do you only have one monitor yes i

infiltrated your studios yes i think you were the first one actually james who you put it in the chat at one point and i was like what does this mean what am i talking about crapple and then sheller

are we at now i don't know one point we might be at one point or not one point eight point five i don't even know we've gotten to at this point eight point six all right we're almost there we're almost meeting you argentina let's see i need answer why are daily wire conservative men playing mario kart instead of real men games like call of duty halo or battlefield i don't know do the guys play mario kart uh have they only the cox and then no i meant to the daily wire guys have they played videos or they've done it carter probably does oh my god our meme king just got roasted in this video um i actually don't know if any of the the wire hosts play those games i don't know if any of the i'm sure i mean folks on our team definitely game um but anyway um all right guys i am going to wrap this up now because it is four o'clock here so i need to start wrapping it up i okay i'm actually very excited for monday's episode because this crazy woman reacted to matt walsh's documentary what is a woman and it's kind of hysterical so i'm going to go back and finish watching that um because i think we're going to do that for monday and i kind of feel bad dedicating an entire episode to this woman because she has kind of a sad youtube channel but it is literally hysterical she did not even watch the i shouldn't have said she's reacting to what is a woman she literally just saw the trailer and was like oh my god i was bombarded with transphobia yeah and guys if you guys think that lena dunham is sexy i mean your preview for monday anyway okay that was you said that not me anyway guys um that i think that'll be monday we'll see what else happens over the weekend uh tonight we have a couple of fun segments coming out including one about tim poole who just got swatted for the ninth freaking time and then britney spears because i wanted to pepper in a little bit of pop culture for you guys because there's been a lot of heavy news going around and a lot of intense stuff so hopefully you can enjoy a bit of crazy celebrity whatever anyway y'all hope you have a great weekend have some fun i will see you all next week we will game some more and we will talk more about my radiant farm animals up close and personal alright bye guys i will see you later", "rJvUxpl1kbA": "what's up guys hello i am one minute late today i have not checked the chat to see if anybody was uh giving me crap for that yet but i'm sure that there will be because you guys are incredibly punctual uh how is everybody i think my chat is moving very slowly something's going on um i'm in my tennessee jersey right now because i just had hershel walker on the show it's not gonna come out today it'll be out next week because we had to film it later in the day so don't have time to edit it um but he was in the office we had a great time i'm i'm so excited for you guys to see this herschel is running for senate in georgia he is so sweet we had a ton of fun i learned and you guys will all learn that while he is fantastic at football and he loves football he didn't grow up watching football and he i feel like if you had the definition of athlete the picture like a picture of herschel should be there because the amount of sports that he's played is insane we talked a lot about that but because they played for georgia i had to pull out the tennessee one and he actually really loved it i expected some drama but he was like i love your jersey you look great in orange i was like thanks hershel anyway so that's what i'm doing but i feel like i should be wearing a warriors jersey since they won the finals last night um and that's sort of my team it has been my whole family's team so i feel like i'm giving you know a hint of sport but the sports that i actually follow i'm not really uh leaning into right now sadly but yay goers i posted that video earlier this morning we're on a new posting schedule you guys let me know what you think um but we're doing one at night when we were doing two episodes a night and then we're gonna be posting one during the day just so we can space them out a bit give the people some content at lunch when you're on your lunch break or whatever um so we posted one about uh big dogs pretending to be fake klay thompson which has been his thing for like the past seven years big dawgs as a youtuber like an og like prank dude just got banned from chase center because he was impersonating clay uh so go check that one out that one was already posted we'll have our comment section episodes out soon but i wanted to talk about how chris evans is a beta um just put it lightly the left and people on social media who adore him like to say that he is the better chris because there's chris hemsworth there's chris evans and then there's chris pratt everybody hates chris pratt which is stupid because i think he's an angel but they all hate him because they think that he's obviously like homophobic and christian and conservative whatever they love to hate on him um i was very happy to see um that they are not removing him from guardians of the galaxy and that that will you know not happen thankfully i'm glad that you know marvel has his back but people like to hate on him chris hemsworth i think they're like on but everybody loves chris evans because chris evans is a beta and he's like like why put in the caption the left wing like favorite white knight he's just idiotic so anyway he is playing buzz lightyear in disney's new movie light year which is just like what they have taken from tim allen like we had tim allen and now we have freaking chris evans which is idiotic but there is a lesbian kiss in light year this new movie and all these muslim countries and a few in china said we're not going to show the movie unless you remove the kiss they originally were going to they cut it out and then they got some backlash so they put it back in so all these muslim countries they will not be able to see the film whatever now i don't care if you have one lesbian kiss in there like i truly it's not my like we all know disney's crazy so they're probably gonna put some you know whatever lgbtq something into every film these days i'm just kind of like immune to it at this point but it is a trend especially with disney that they like i'm seeing you guys are talking about it here but you can't beat tim allen yet you can't love chris hemsworth he is he's great but i still prefer chris pratt but anyway um it's a trend with disney that they censor lgbtq stuff they censor people of color in their films to make it more marketable for another audience and i think that they are maybe realizing that that has not been too great for their leftist brand i think they've been able to fly under the radar a bit because they removed it and then they put it back in so it's just not going to be shown in those countries i'm not exactly sure what they've decided to do for china i'm guessing that they will just cut it and be very quiet about it because there's a huge disney market in china but they just always censor that stuff um and so i feel like financially they have to do that but they haven't they've only been talking about the muslim countries uh so we'll see what happens but uh chris evans i'm pulling it up he's trending right now because uh chris evans is calling out anyone who has a problem with the same-sex kiss in light year so i thought we would just watch um this video from variety here it is okay here he is look at this stupid little face all right here we go guys something else we reported on was the removal and then the reinstatement of this kiss between alicia and her wife disney kind of put a line in the sand saying we're putting this back in but also we are not going to remove it from any other territories in these places that you know would have a problem with it what did you make of the company making that decision it's great i mean i and as great as it is and you know i've been asked the question a few times it's nice and it's wonderful makes me happy it's it's tough to not be a little frustrated that it even has to be a topic of discussion that it is this kind of news the the goal is that we can get to a point where it is the norm and that this doesn't have to be some you know unchartered waters that that eventually this is just the way it is that representation across the board is how we make films and so hopefully that that you know it's look it's an honor to be a part of something that is taking those steps but but the goal is uh to look back on this time and just be shocked that that it took us this long to get there okay i don't know about y'all but he literally just said a bunch of fluff that's literally okay having representation across the board that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the fact that disney parrots themselves as being like the most woke the most progressive we have our not-so-secret gay agenda that's literally what their execs said but they consistently on record cut things out so he's is he saying that across the board in all of those countries everywhere that he wants like lgbtq representation we need that to be the norm do you do you want to go to any of those countries and try to say that chris i don't i don't really think that's going to fly it's going to fly here in america apparently because that's what's happening but if you're making these grandiose statements about wanting this to be the norm and disney's taking a stand whatever no we all know how corrupt disney is and if they're going to lose a bunch of money by keeping that kiss in they're not going to do it again my guess my guess because if you look up like disney lightyear kiss tons of stories and they're kind of making themselves the hero here i'll do it right now let's see um disney lightyear kiss muslim here we go yeah so they're all over and they're basically you know pointing at all of these countries saying like how awful they are how backwards they are and they're making disney the hero for putting the kiss back in it oh or whatever it's like a pride month stunt and sure it's like good i'm glad that i guess you're keeping the integrity of the film or whatever but this literally is for their publicity because they have gotten you know flack for shooting near the uyghur camps uh for uh mulan uh removing or making john boyega really really small in the star wars poster what are some of the other ones that they've done they removed another kiss from uh uh god what was the doctor strange they removed some stuff from doctor strange because that girl wears the pride pin and then her moms are lesbian a bunch of other stuff like they are on record they do that consistently and i feel like they've they've started to get noticed so they're making this a whole ordeal like i said they're not talking about china yet and china is a really important market so i don't really know um but anyway that's been i hate disney i hate disney okay i'm gonna go back to your super chats because i uh have missed them uh up until now okay here we go hey james nice to see you hey i just saw daily wire entertainment looking for ideas here's one mickey mouse as the copyright runs out soon that's true it does yes so uh the winnie the pooh copyright just ran out and we saw what happened with that they're making a horror movie out of uh winnie the pooh but yes mickey mouse's copyright is running out um that's happened before and they usually they have such strong like powerful lawyers uh disney every time that it's happened before has been able to go back in and like readjust the laws but there's something different happening this year i'm not i don't obviously i ended up not going to law school so i don't understand anything about copyright law but um it's there's something where it's like they've like re-upped it so many times that now it must like it has to go into the public domain i don't really know how that's gonna work i'll be interested to see what happens but um that would be really funny if we if we took mickey mouse for our own hunter says what is the best part of working at daily wire um probably the fact that every day is different which is nice obviously i come in and i do you know my show every day uh you know i have sort of a routine uh we do these you know live streams twice a week but the content that i'm talking about the people that i'm working with people i'm interviewing you know that sort of thing it is new every day with the news cycle and as a result i'm constantly interested in different things i'm constantly learning about things reading you know staying updated on the news and so as a result it just keeps me entertained and excited i'm definitely somebody that gets bored in a work environment very easily if i'm not pushed and challenged and able to like tackle new projects and we have a pretty strong hustle culture here honestly because we're very mission driven and so as a result like we're constantly on to the next project always working on something new and so for me personally i think it works for my personality type because i like literally it'll be i'll start a job and i'll be like oh my god this is the greatest thing ever and my mom jokes with me about it and then three months in it's like oh my god i'm doing the same thing every single day i'm so bored i'm over it i hate these people whatever i've been here seven months now and i still love it and i do i do think that it is because one the hustle and two everyday is different so it keeps me entertained keeps me excited uh alrighty joe jersey uh got my jeremy's razors because smooth legs aren't just for male models anymore i hate hairs love it got guys if you have not gotten jeremy's razors go place an order give your money don't what does jeremy always say he says don't give your money to companies who hate you give it to me instead there you go you can give your money to germany boring uh but yeah the razors are arriving to people now it's very exciting people are posting a lot of pictures of seeing them because i think people were confused when they saw the commercial there was this whole you know thing in the car i was reading all the comments obviously comment section and a lot of people were saying you know is this a joke like this commercial's crazy like is this really real no it is real the razors are arriving it is very fun so i'm glad anybody who has purchased them glad that you are receiving them all right let's see pork chop sandwiches sheller do you see that yep there you go you had to take all that time to say that one yep let's see um and actors political views don't affect me whether or not i enjoy a movie i'm used to all of them having garbage takes yeah that's very true honestly um i think i'll still watch a movie with chris evans in it but when he opens his mouth i would prefer to hear chris pratt talk so i think that's kind of where i come from uh let's see it should be tim allen they use the excuse that tim allen is the voice of the toy but the character from the show that he's based on that's a lie toy story um uh that's a lie toy story is the show woody's program tom hanks voice is it yes that's correct i mean i would have loved to see i mean i guess he's older now and they probably wanted to make him younger they probably could also argue that but i mean tim allen is just iconic but hollywood has definitely pushed him aside in recent years i was impressed that last man standing went as long as it did but i also was bummed because i loved that show during coven they were all wearing masks and feeding into all of the bs and so i stopped watching it at that point because i didn't want to watch a tv show where everybody was wearing masks and talking about kovid while i was living in the midst of it i don't know if any of you guys are fans of uh last man standing but um yeah just let me know because i stopped watching it that i don't even i think i watched the first episode of that season saw they were wearing masks and oh you have a take i was just going to say that i'm actually an extra in one of the episodes you are guys my producer yeah which one i've watched all of them except the last season i i think it was like season seven or eight all i remember is obvi obviously um jay leno was in the episode okay yes and someone was getting married and so i was at the wedding oh was it uh crap was this uh mike's like parents or the one of the one of the in-laws like got remarried his mom or her mom that's probably it yeah maybe i want to go find you in that all right let's see um did you do the pandering is frankly insulting to gay people tbh yes it is it's like because they it's the same thing with all of the race stuff they take the you know minority vote for for granted and it's it's just idiotic um it's like you are you're not capable of like having your own representation whatever we're going to pretend to like uplift your voices we're going to pretend to you know give you representation whatever but actually when it comes to money we don't actually really care it's all just for minuscule brownie points on social media but if you are actually looking for any kind of empathy or acceptance you're not going to get from those big corporations because it's all about money um yeah when they say representation what they really mean is pandering and patronizing yes you are not wrong uh paul says dang is going to get to a point with disney where i allow my future kids to only watch the chinese censored movies there you go i mean you guys if you guys have been around for a while you know that i was not allowed to watch any disney at all well number one did not have television was not allowed to watch tv until i was like late teens so only a few years ago and barely watched any movies i was just you know outside reading books had a very not off the grid childhood obviously but was just not using a lot of technology as a kid um but i was not allowed to watch any disney stuff i saw a couple of the classic films but did not really associate them with disney i thought that they were just like random like cartoon animated movies had no idea that it was all under one umbrella uh didn't know anything about the princesses wasn't allowed to have any disney paraphernalia literally and it wasn't even for political reasons at that point my mom is like yeah the beginning my mom at the early in the early 2000's realized a shift when the new leadership with disney came in um and it just became so corporate and like they were trying to infiltrate every aspect of a child's life from you know their pencils to the diapers to the backpacks to the the parks growing like crazy the films got more political their tv shows disney's channel just got really bratty that kind of thing uh it was not the influence that she wanted on me so did not even have that which triggers a lot of people like when i posted that when all the disney like nazi secret gay agenda stuff came out when i posted that anecdote about not being able to watch disney people lost their damn mind my favorite comment was somebody said sounds like you had a miserable child and now you're having to or you sound like you had a miserable childhood today you're trying to push it on other people it's like no i was actually a pretty happy kid like i literally didn't know anything and you're only confirming my argument when i'm saying that my my mom was worried about disney taking over my life and you at like 30 years old are freaking out that i didn't watch it like i do think that it had some kind of hold on you sir it was like some man so anyway i don't really care that i didn't watch it so i don't know who knows what disney will be you know doing when i have kids but at this rate probably won't be watching it see although they banned the movie in our country saudi arabia we can still watch it once they release it on disney plus there we go all right enjoy your lesbian kiss in that movie if you choose to watch um uh anthony ree there we go i just read that out loud for you what's up thank you for the super chat i appreciate it uh okay went to the zoo today and played with a ball python and a bird eating spider my gosh your thoughts on snakes and spiders uh they don't bother me honestly i'm not too literally guys the one thing that i am squeamish about is birds so much so that my mom thought that you know when i was getting older and i really expressed this deep-rooted trauma that i have with birds she gave me crap for it because she thought that it was just me trying to act like a silly girl basically and find something to be afraid of because i really am not squeamish like i was at dinner the other night and there was a spider on the table and i was like sure i'll just grab it and like whatever i ended up squishing it but i was like oh fine i'll just get it whatever my brother uh caught a black widow for me at one point when we were back in chattanooga and i kept it in a jar with like a cheesecloth over the top of it for like a week or so i don't know how long however long i was able to keep it alive by my bed my brothers all had reptiles and snakes and that kind of thing so they don't really bother me that much like i genuinely am not squeamish about that stuff um i don't really know why but i'm not it's literally just birds so snake spiders they're cool don't mind them um i was i was the kid that would like go around and like try to catch frogs and bugs and stuff like the praying mantises we would always have those in front of our door in chattanooga so i'll try to catch him let's see brett what did you think of jordan peterson's commencement speech at hillsdale this year if you haven't seen it i highly recommend it i started watching it right when it came out and i don't think i finished it so i will go back and uh re-watch it he's incredible um so i will definitely do that he's one of my favorites shamelessly asking for a shout out for damian damien is that you neurodivergent is that who i'm talking to are you damien anyway what's up damien shout out uh from your friend here hope you're doing well we're having a great friday let's see okay roll tide love it there you go i've a ton of my friends from home went to bama so yes roll tide there you go even though i've never seen a bama game i think i've maybe been to alabama's campus maybe once when i was four years old if i see somebody in like any kind of bama gear i will always say roll tide just because it's like you feel like you're part of something like i'm such an imposter i would be in la and i would see somebody with like the red baseball cap on and be like real tight they'd be like oh yeah roll tide then you should walk away you never speak to him again but i felt like it was part of it okay jamie says hey bread opinion on pineapple pizza also hi to rocky rocky says hi back even though she's not here we had a dog in the studio today because i had tyler fisher on the show who is one of the stars of terror on the prairie which is our new daily wire film if you have not seen it go check it out fair warning it's a western it is real intense lots of violence but if you're into that kind of thing go become a subscriber check that out i think we might still have our discount code going i'm not exactly sure uh it should be in gina chrono's instagram profile if it is we still do have it going so we got a good deal if you want to watch it but tyler is in it he's a comedian he's a great guy so he was on the show as well i had two guests today it was super fun but he brought his dog in with him and she's precious and she's also sort of a doodle she's not a white crusty dog exactly but she is part poodle anyway so i will say hi to rocky i'm going home to her momentarily very excited uh pineapple one pizza i don't personally like it but i don't think it's an atrocity people who lose their mind over it saying that it's atrocious it's like no i okay here's the thing my favorite pizza which some people will hate um is macaroni and cheese pizza have i told you that yeah they okay they're agreeing the boys are agreeing um in uh ocean side so oceanside is like part of san diego um one of the beach towns ocean side i'm pretty sure it's an ocean side maybe it's in la jolla and no no it's an ocean side because la jolla is below san diego so it was oceanside there is pizza place called pandora's pizza i used to go there all the time uh they have a macaroni and cheese pizza it has bacon bits on top chives it is insane it is so good i don't know if you guys have ever had it um but so that's i say that people are like oh that's so weird the texture so i can't really give people crap for putting pineapple on their pizza like i literally eat a heart attack on a pizza basically so anyway oh let's see uh disproportionate movie making uh equals quota what happened to the stories yes i absolutely agree with that when i was trying to figure out if i wanted to stay in entertainment or not i started moving over to working in production which had always been my long-term goal i wanted to go into producing so i'd done a few internships but my last internship uh at the end of my college career which was supposed to turn into you know a full-time job with this company and i love love love this company they are academy award-winning they do incredible character-driven kind of indie gritty stories just really finding the good in humanity like they are a lot of the stuff that they did was not conservative but things that you know people right of center that just like normal common sense americans like good values the stories were semi-edgy and gritty but they always had like a tinge of hope at the end and it you know i don't know it just left you feeling inspired in some sort of way even if the story was you know gritty or intense or whatever so basically just a normal movie yes exactly literally a traditional normal movie the best parts of hollywood and i loved working there and i was like oh my god like i hit the jackpot with working here blm happened we started having diversity quotas and my job as an intern was i was doing this and this is also during coven was i uh was a development intern so i worked with people submitting projects to us and i was kind of the in between between the like people pitching the agents and that kind of thing and our producers i read all the scripts first did uh mock-ups of all of them um you know wrote the synopsis my thoughts on it whether i thought that it should be pushed on to a producer whatever and i was kind of decided whether you know our producers were going to see it or not so i caught everything and i kept you know pitching and pushing forward these stories that i thought were really narrative driven and the feedback that i kept getting was okay we need a native american story we need we need one with a black girl we need this like oh we're we're scrapping like sixty percent of our projects cause we don't have enough things that are like women led or that you know are led by people of color and we had some incredible incredible films that were gonna be made and they were being scrapped because they weren't fitting quotas and we were gonna have too many like white men leads or whatever it was such bs and it became such a drag and ended up not taking that job um post college that's when i decided to go to law school that was kind of the final straw for me was i was like i don't think that i this is gonna be something that i can really survive in because i hated it it went from being something that i really loved and was passionate about and was very proud of the projects that i felt like we were you know putting out in the world because i thought they were good for audiences um and so i just couldn't you know balance that out with you know my interests and my values so that's why i'm here but anyway so yes the story's out the window now it's all about quotas which is too bad let's see james let's see you should cover how xbox official twitch account uh just say was streaming a man and drag to their audience of under 18s what ew we pull that up early i can look it up here should i look at this hold on don't share my screen yet let me see twitch i'm scared of what i'm gonna twitch drag xbox oh god i'm scared oh dragon i don't like this i don't like this at all all right i'm going to do this another time because i want to actually find the one because right now i'm just getting weird twitch stuff that's popping up like drag queen twitch i don't i don't think any of us really want to see that to be honest i personally don't let's see um last night i was at the bar started talking to a guy and you know what he told me he said that he could get express uh three months free from expressvpn when he uses code ben love that what's up no name happy to see you here guys i might have my own expressvpn code soon so no name when you send your obligatory comment every single live stream which i appreciate like you and james you guys every like without fail i appreciate it you guys are always here um you're gonna have to use code brett because it's coming so get stoked expressvpn um one of the newest sponsors gleeman uh speaking of disney have you seen the travesty that is the obi-wan kenobi show are you a fan of star wars all the good iep is under attack right now no i have not so i have seen what i now know is called the ot um see how cool i was when i just said that my team over here has their head in their hands literally listen i've seen them it was a long time ago my mom loves star wars i think i've said this before so she showed me the ot but i don't remember the ot i'm gonna say that as much as possible now yeah we're gonna watch them though we are we're gonna have a team bonding event we're all going to go over to sheller's house because he has a very big fancy tv and he has the extended versions or whatever before george lucas went in i don't know what they're called don't don't laugh at me the original version the originals okay um probably on blu-ray because he loves blu-ray no no no it's a video file okay sounds good really big high bitrate okay great nerd that's such a nerd anyway all of us bobby over here in the corner we're all gonna go over and we're gonna watch star wars for my own uh education so no because of that i'm not the biggest uh i haven't watched any of the extra stuff on disney plus i don't have disney plus so i've not seen obi-wan kenobi i haven't seen mandalorian any of that all i know about the more recent star wars things is baby oda and i even think the baby yoda is overused doesn't mean it was cute for like a week and then since i'm not in like i'm not invested in it i was like i don't i don't care that's fair thank you that's a hot take i might just get slammed in the comments for that uh anyway but no i've not seen it let's see why do companies switch from the ukraine flag to the pride flag and gino not a homophobe or whatever but it's the grooming part i don't like yeah exactly and i you're i feel like these two are kind of two separate you know conversations first of all they're moving on to whatever the next thing is that's going to get the money from the left it's all woke pandering and patronizing they're wanting to seem as woke and as progressive as possible so that their audiences can feel good about supporting those companies and whatever the trendy sjw thing is they will they will adapt their logos basically to fit that narrative basically whatever cnn tells them that is important they will uh they will follow and no i i not a homophobe i do not care what goes on in your bedroom do not care who you love whatever my issue and this is with gay people and straight people is if you're trying to talk about weird sex stuff with small children and that includes gender theory and all of that it includes putting your four-year-olds in pageants or putting them in dance competitions where they are barely wearing any clothing and like twerking on stage a lot cuties all of it is weird we live in a hyper-sexualized society but sadly i do think that more conservatives and people like right of center a lot of people just like general common sense are the ones saying hey this is weird i want to stop that and because most of those people are right of center they're i think people on the left are turning it back on like oh you just hate gay people it's like no we just don't really like any of this at least i don't um and it's so weird that like this i talked about this on the show today like why is this like grooming stuff in the drag queens like drag queen story hour why is that the hill that they want to die on like exposing children to naked men twerking exposing children to like for preschoolers reading books about i can be any gender i want and like i know what my sexuality is you are literally six like i you go pick your boogers whatever just don't think about being attracted to somebody else right now like don't that's weird um so it it just feels like they get so defensive my favorite thing one of their tactics is that if you point out that something might be grooming or that something is like hey this is sexual this is weird they point it back to you and they say oh my god you are the freak because you are making it sexual you're pointing out the sex stuff that's weird and then they switch it again and they start adamantly defending it and saying oh no it's fine it's like we've already established that there's something sexual here and you're blaming me for it and now you're going to start defending it like pick be principled my primary critique of the left is i would have more respect for them and i probably would have you know respect for like old school democrats because they had more principles modern day left the radicals all of that they switch their beliefs they change their principles depending on what is convenient if they at least stood for something i might have more respect and could have you know whatever but the extreme and that's really just goes for like that one percent the crazy people all that um anyway so that was a rant sorry about that uh i used to watch disney sitcoms as a kid and they are so mean they lowkey promo bullying yes oh my god thank you okay and also the relationships with parents number one the parents usually look like idiots i'm probably gonna get flamed for this but i disney channel i would the only time i would really watch it was when we were at hotels and i would get like oh i have a tv for the first time and i can watch the disney channel even then my mom really didn't really let me watch it and looking back i'm glad that she did because i was kind of resentful for a bit because the parents are usually absent or they are idiots and they provide no boundaries for their kids and they're like whatever like running around letting kids get into nonsense the kids are mean to each other they have no respect for their parents there's no structure whatsoever so no wonder gen z like expects that that is how you know their parental relationship should go how hostile they are the online aspect of it just makes it worse and also as gen z is becoming parents and like younger millennials i was watching a tick tock the other day where a woman was saying like my kid doesn't have a bedtime i don't make her do chores i'll do her laundry for her um i don't really ground her that kind of thing it's like okay she's gonna get into the real world and it's gonna chew her up and spit her out because you've never held her accountable for anything because you're too scared that she's gonna feel unloved and you know like suffocated no i'm very glad that my parents were strict that my mom was strict i mean she like laid down the law but there was also a mutual respect because i always understood she was great at explaining if there was a rule or if she did you know ask me to do something she always had a reasonable explanation for it that i could understand that i respected even if i didn't want to do it um and so yeah i do think that disney honestly i don't want to be you know saying disney causes all of our problems or whatever but i do think that they helped create that culture in my generation um let's say you have to ask when is there going to be merch i need something to wear under my yes weekend a sweatshirt working on it um we just have a ton going on here and our ecom guys and our designers they are cranking out stuff for all of our other projects so we have some preliminary things uh just wanna get it right so when we do it'll be a cool drop it'll be very fun so i will obviously keep you guys updated for now we have that stickers we wanted to have something on the website but i will have merch soon i'm sure see peter says what do you mean you don't like birds it's a falconer this hurts my soul bsl from ireland double ps i used to be pretty lib now uh more mod thanks to you and daily wire lips have gone insane thank you so much peter i really appreciate it hello um i've always wanted to go to ireland that sounds fun you know for you peter i would go i would go see a falcon i would i would be very afraid i'm not gonna lie we had um an eagle a very famous eagle come into the office when we were shooting the jeremy's razor's commercial uh he's the one that like flies in at the like super bowl and all that stuff and he's the one in the iconic video with trump where he like went like this to trump um and i'm not kidding i was like semi shaking but i did get a cool picture from him so that was cool and that was great and i survived but i if i had the opportunity to meet a falcon because kind of one of my i don't i wouldn't say sticks i was about to say like shtick i don't think that's the right word to use um but a kind of a phrase that i use is i'll try anything once if it's food if it's whatever if it's an experience i'll like jump out of a plane i'll go do whatever i just like like sucking the mirror out of life as much as possible so if i got the chance to meet a falcon to go do something hell yeah i would go do it would i be afraid yes but peter i would do it i think i just have like childhood trauma from birds because we used to have ducks and i think probably one of them tried to kill me maybe that's it i don't know anyway yes libs have gone insane uh glad you're here welcome to this safe haven of common sense regardless of what you used to be or what your ideology is now welcome let's see um oh peter oh again he sent another super chat thanks peter triple ps your meme editor is just chef's kiss they are not in the room right now but they are sick we've got two of them they're awesome uh before jay uh joining daily wire do people still tell you that you looked like ben a couple of them but it was not as constant obviously because i wasn't associated with him at all but now that it is now that i am it's constant um it has it's slowed down as of late or maybe i'm just not noticing as much because i've just been getting a lot of comments about other things but at the beginning my gosh when i was first getting introduced to the whole daily wire community and audience it was constant no toppings on pizza belongs oh no topping belongs on pizza other than cheese the rest of personal preference the most clear example of that is pineapple yeah cheese sauce whatever go ahead that's fine i will say my brothers were super weird they were very picky eaters they would do pizza with no sauce they also would just do butter noodles is what they would say so my mom would have to make them pasta with just these are the twins uh with just butter and parm and then their pizzas they didn't want sauce on it so it would just be like cheesy bread basically anyway let's see when will you have your own show on spotify did my administration uh did my administration's inflation destroy those plans possibly oh joseph sleepy biden oh that's your account name that's funny uh we are just on youtube as of right now um if i do have a podcast sometime in the future that'll be on spotify but we're keeping this show on the uh web for right now so you can just find it here but i know i do get damn some people saying like i want to be able to like listen to it in the car or whatever so i do feel like this is a difficult show to have that you know work with just because of the memes and the you know clips that i show uh so i do feel like the format is better and i communicate more effectively on youtube but if i do a podcast obviously you guys will know and it'll be on spotify let's see here's five bucks for my birthday tomorrow homeschoolers rock everybody all right we always wish somebody happy birthday and do some shout outs everybody tell jonathan happy birthday it is his birthday tomorrow um thank you for the super chat i appreciate it and yes homeschoolers do rock love to have you here but yes guys say happy birthday to jonathan be nice see when you uh since you rubbed shoulders with the quartering when

just insane um by the way i'll you guys will obviously be in the know when i'm able to do that kind of stuff let's see brett check out invasion at dinner by gravity well films it's on youtube we shot it during the lockdowns mostly conservative team i played rupert collins in the film you write that down invasion at dinner by gravity well films love it if you're a conservative filmmaker anybody if

show earlier on truth he replied to my post saying hey you're that guy in black uber oh that's so cool i love it i know you okay so the guy i need to give a shout out i can't i don't have the capacity to like pin things right now but the folks that are always here in the super chats john james and no name literally every single day you guys are amazing and like you're great i also feel like john is more i feel like i know you guys john is more moderate and has like moved more in that direction after being a leftist and so always appreciate his opinion no name is always in here with the expressvpn and james is always posting funny stuff and telling me to watch things and he's from the uk so anyway those are the dudes that are in here all the time i appreciate you guys but that's very cool uh no name says uh who needs star wars gina carano yeah exactly guys somebody commented on one of my posts uh when i at the red carpet with gina and they said disney is quaking right now and i was like heck yeah it is because we got her and she's sick she is so beautiful so wonderful incredibly kind and well-spoken and i'm very lucky to have her as a mentor and as a friend because she really is exceptional she also is so soft-spoken and sweet and then you like kind of take a second to step back and you realize oh my gosh she could kick my ass like i could be dead right now but she's just so like soft-spoken and wonderful so anyway she's great uh hopefully we'll have her on the show soon we gotta figure out what we're gonna do but she's gonna be on all right any tips on a no-name guy trying to pitch movies to daily why i love the film industry and prefer how daily wear goes about it i'm not exactly sure um but we are pretty interactive on our daily wire entertainment and bonfire legend instagram pages that's just something that i've noticed from like the outside um but and there's a lot of people that meet in those comments sections dallas sonja is our um is the head exec producer at uh bonfire who does all of our films here and he does a lot of things in his posts where he'll say like all right if you are you know creatives introduce yourselves in the comments you know connect so a lot of connections have been made there i would check that out um he does a very good job of trying to foster a community online even though he's not that you know they're in person not able to really do stuff outside of that you know full hollywood model that happens in l.a um and he's just a really kind mentor and so he tries to foster that on that instagram page so i would check that out that's all really i can say lee it says brett i'm moving to australia next week wish me luck i'm nervous you're awesome uh your friend the center left is haley i remember you telling me that uh that's super cool i hope you can hug a koala for me because everybody knows i love koalas i would like i want to go to i want to go to australia and hug a koala so bad my uh explore page on instagram i'm not even kidding you guys is mostly koalas and i'm not mad about it i'm not mad about it it's better than all of the like drag trans stuff that is on my tick tock because i mine for content there so as a result my for you page of my algorithm is like horrifying stuff so i prefer my instagram stays like happy soft squishy koala lounging that's how i feel um just got flagged by big brother what is that oh do you say something in the trap that got you banned sir did you get suspended bobby did you suspend somebody my chat mods are on it today um fan base name other than cooper simps please i think i think they named i think you guys named it isn't it cooper troopers maybe i feel like it's weird for me to be like oh my like my audience is named this i think that's odd i'm just i'm waiting for you guys to authentically decide on something i'll put some i'll put it on a murt on some merch stuff um but i don't i want it to be real and authentic i don't want to name you all i don't wanna i don't wanna but miss gender i don't wanna uh miss fan club you i don't wanna oppress you um anyway but i feel like it was cooper troopers that started within my all-access lives that i do for daily wire members and they all were calling themselves cooper troopers and then i think it moved over here as well so maybe that's it uh i saw the chicken coop at one point uh there's so there's been some things um some people on reddit are like simp army rise up or something like that so they're those that's the cooper sims or whatever i don't really know guys whatever you want i just want you to feel i need to get on my like best like diversity equity officer voice here i just want you all to feel affirmed and included and loved as part of this audience and so whatever name makes you feel most appreciated i can't do it that was like borderline school counselor well that's that's what i that's what i feel like i am i am the diversity officer in like a woke hr department or like a administrator school administration what else could i say um i'm just so happy that you're here and if you ever feel triggered by anything that i you know i say please just like please let me know i am just here to make sure that you feel seen and represented and whole and if you don't i will i will post the bigots on facebook so that they can all get attacked by the i don't know where i'm going with this anyway there you go that's my impression of the day of a diversity equity and inclusion officer oh that's the other word that i missed uh inclusion i want you to feel included anyway so yeah guys let me know what the name is uh i take back what i said so long ago base cooper is now brett cringer uh gotta tune him or the cop uh pop culture the gaming is a start though yeah i know but i kind of own it like i never hid the fact that i was a horse girl i never had the fact that i was musical theater kid never had the fact that i was homeschooled and didn't watch television so if you are surprised by this not my fault i'd say i think i've been pretty open about it you can't it's very difficult for me to hide the fact that i'm a bit eccentric right you don't hide the fact that you have a crusty white coat okay well we don't need to bring the dogs into this shell we don't need to do that that's just like an attack i need to talk with the diversity exclusion inclusion officer because my dog is being oppressed at the moment one thing with the lgbtq the alphabet people is that they don't realize that they're reinforcing all these negative gay stereotypes by exposing kids to drag events yes no they're not all yes and he says not all gay people are creeps and obsessed with sex exactly which is what is so infuriating and i think what infuriates a lot of my gay friends one of my best friends is gay and it's like he refuses to associate with the lgbtq community now because so many of them the politicized ones are just crying all this stuff from the mountaintop and making the very you know normal wonderful you know people look like you know crazies and they're not but the fact that is the thing that is so weird is that the democrats and all these people that are just trying to please everybody and be progressive as possible are latching on to that going oh that's what all of the lgbtq people want and running with it no it's not that's not what they want that's not what a lot of america wants like literally just leave people alone like the identity politics stuff it is just it's gross anyway someone says uh you'll meet all of our adair manor and limerick you'll meet all of our american bald eagles other eagles falcons and owls you'll love them uh we'll get you doing some archery too that's peter in ireland listen what what if sheller what if we went to ireland and i faced my fear of birds with uh with peter here and i do archery yes all right great all right cool um i guess i have to run that by the people who pay for my stuff but at least it's good that'd be fun i mean i literally i that would be terrifying but i would do it maybe i can do something in ireland else i can go like speak or something but anyway that'd be fun good content let's see um it sucks how i came out as bisexual when i was 15 and that was 12 years ago i don't relate at all to what the lgbtq community is now it is so creepy now i used to be liberal now i'm conservative yep that's i mean you are basically reaffirming what we were just saying it is this new wave of it's like the third wave feminism but for lgbtq stuff and it's just there's a lot of people that i think are walking away from that whole you know identity and community and you know political thing because of that and it's i mean it kind of works for us because it helps people are who are more you know right of center and who are i feel like have the right mindset about politics but like the dems really it's a terrible strategy because they're shooting themselves in the foot i mean you guys saw with myra flores in texas she just uh won a seat in the 34th district in the rio grande valley it is a seat that has been held by a democrat for the last 140 years 150 years her district is 84 hispanic she won she was born in mexico she immigrated here legally her husband uh is also mexican and is a border patrol agent like and she's a woman and she is shattering the glass ceiling like she is everything that the left should want but they are silent about her they're not even silent they're saying that she is like a white christian nationalist a white christian nationalist because she does not fall in line with their agenda they have taken these you know minorities people that they call oppressed for granted thinking that they will automatically have their votes and they're focusing on all of this like the drag stuff they are walking away from their base by focusing on this ridiculous crap trying to push this bs in schools and with kids and all of that saying that if you don't support it you're a bigot and they are alienating these people that they you know claim to support and that they think will obviously or will always have their votes um so maybe i think that the tide is turned turning myra was also the first republican that elon supported and voted for and he's putting some money behind her as well so exciting stuff uh okay hi brad greetings from nottingham england home of the fabled here robin hood and the greatest club in the world the nottingham forest fc if you've been to england and if not why pints on me i have been to england in 2018 i believe i was in eastern europe 2019 so i think 18 or 17 i was in england um didn't do too much i was actually supposed to study uh abroad in england but that was during cove it was my junior year and it was canceled which is a bummer because i had always wanted to study abroad i was going to do a whole shakespeare program because i am a nerd obviously part of it was going to be um i was going to be living in stratford bonneville which is where shakespeare's from studying shakespeare there with a few academics and then going and doing some stuff at oxford sadly did not get to they offered to like do part of it online which i was not no absolutely not uh so i have been england have not spent a ton of time there was hoping that i would have set more by now but we'll have to go at some point let's see i just got snapchat for your content keep up the work good work yes guys okay so you have you have comment section on youtube you can follow my instagram i'm also on twitter sometimes i post funny things i don't really know we also post stuff on tick tock i have my own channel now but we just got approved for a snap show on snap discover if you still use snapchat um i thought it was dead for a bit and then now it's completely i feel like back again especially with all the new stuff like the amount of people that watch our daily wire stories on uh snap is absolutely insane so anyway some comment section stuff will be up on snapchat we'll hopefully do some specials for that so you can go follow it there it is just at the comment section with brett cooper it is on snap discover go check it out if you're interested let's see um just wondering how is gina chrono in person she seems really sweet and funny and a person uh for a person who could definitely beat up most people yes she is like has major stage fright does not like speaking in front of people is so so kind so sweet like i we had been dming a bunch and i texted her and we had been in touch for a while but i never met her in person until this week and she just like rushed in while we were getting ready for the red carpet give me this huge hug she is truly so wonderful um really a class act and it because of how kind she is it just makes it even more horrific the things that you know disney put her through and that fan base did to her because she is truly so lovely and so i'm very happy to have her here part of this team and like i said as a mentor and a friend she's wonderful let's see um oh yes james says i also remind that american football is just rugby with extra steps yes you are right uh of course uh with all the years democrats doing nothing for inner cities and black communities why uh is there no thinking of let's try something else and see what happens i just feel like it's photo ops and that's all yes it is it really is they um i think a lot of people are waking up i mean like i said that's what we're seeing with um a lot of the hispanic community um and i think that there is i don't know the dems really they do have a hold on those communities just because their communication is so good but they really have a lot of empty promises um blexit is candace owens's org she does absolutely incredible work she actually goes into black communities actually shows them you know what the private sector what non-profits can do exposes a lot of democrat lies and has done incredible work um so yeah it really is and the kind of the way of their like reverse racism where a lot of democrat policies just reaffirm the things that they try to fight against so they're saying oh you're so oppressed and we're gonna like everybody else is your oppressor and you you know have no opportunities because of the color of your skin i'm like that's not really uplifting or empowering at all that's just reinforcing a divide that you are apparently you know supposedly against the same thing with a lot of their social security and their economic policies where rather than providing people with the tools to get back on their feet to get clean to get a job to whatever they kind of keep people in this you know cycle of poverty and dependence upon the government and it just makes them more powerful but it really really hurts the people involved and i really don't care i don't think that they care about those communities at all they just want the power and they do want the photo ops and the money um so i think it's across the board an issue let's see oh my goodness this thing just moves so fast what is this uh brett your producers are failing you it cost me another five bucks to have them add color to the super chats fix it you just got yelled at sheller what's new that's what i do every day every day um no name says

actually lgbtq rsuv xyz plus yes exactly i saw it was actually funny there was a tick tock it was with that dylan guy who's now the like i'm on 100 days of being a girl like eight 97 days of girlhood or whatever and he was like prepping for pride month that was trying to rehearse saying lgbtq and it was all of these like gay people in the comments being like oh my god yeah the numbers are getting so long like eve or the letters are getting like so long i can't even you know keep up i was like hey listen even the gay people can't keep up with how many you know letters we have to say might as well it's like um justin trudeau messed up as a hysterical video of him not even being able to say all the letters so we should just say the whole alphabet that's it you're my new favorite daily wire my b days in two days but nothing makes me happier than seeing others happy so here's this also any thoughts on andrew yang appreciate it christian guys we already wish jonathan happy birthday christian's birthday is in two days you know what to do wish him happy birthday i hope you have some fun plans over the weekend um angel yang is interesting i think that he first of all i hate hate his universal basic income stuff that is economically idiotic and would never work and i think would not help human like our society and culture at all especially with how lazy it is it would also tank our economy we are also we are already in massive amounts of debt we saw what the stimulus did um and they would really just try to pull it from our taxes so why are they taking money from us just to redistribute it and give it back like that's socialism in a nutshell redistribution of the wealth uh so i don't agree with that but i do appreciate the fact that he is willing to step outside of the democrat party even though it's not even though i don't really agree with the things that you know he all of his policies i do admire people like him and you know tulsi gabbard and that kind of stuff that are willing to say hey some of this stuff is insane i'm gonna you know remove myself from that but all in all not the biggest fan of him but i don't think that he's the most corrupt person i think that there are worse uh but i don't think that he is the most intelligent by any means um i just sounded like um uh annie from the office there that's my singing thing um on a more serious note i heard about ben talking about the difficulties of publishing books as a straight man how hard would it be to publish your daily wire it is my dream to publish um a fantasy novel i'm not really sure most of our stuff um is done in-house like with our we are publishing our um you know our host books and jonathan isaac and that kind of thing it's a very new department so that's not really something that i'm educated on um oh my goodness where am i going senator kennedy said it best welfare should be a bridge not a parking lot yes exactly i don't think that we need to get you know totally rid of the welfare system i think that there are times when you know people who are severely disabled you know veterans people that really you know are not able to work or you know come on come upon hard times um obviously there should i think that you know there it's fine if there's something in place but the system that is in place now it allows people to just live on it survive on it um i remember being in um you know la and we would finish on tv shows and i would have you know my co-stars or people that i was acting with immediately like the day that we would rap they would be you know filing their you know social security paperwork i was like you just made actors make good money for doing very little to be honest and it was like we we get paid well enough that you know you don't have to work for a couple months while you get a new job that kind of thing and you're immediately just going oh well i'm technically unemployed so i'll get some extra cash from the government so i can blow all the money that i just made on like a new purse or whatever it's like at least understand personal finances have some kind of responsibility and realize you were mooching off the government and you know exploiting a system so anyway yes um watching this while enjoying a good rancher steak heck yes use code cooper get those two 18-ounce ribeyes for free with free shipping with your order wink there we go good ranchers what is my what is their phrase um good ranchers american raised american i always forget it i'm messing it up i'm a tarot i'm a terrible sponsor uh it was like raised right i don't know i'll get it i usually do my little wink um let's see so you had matt walsh on the show when are we getting more content with knowles he all knows is the glue that holds the daily wire together he really is he's an angel uh we are prepping and conniving about some interviews with or not interviews but some video ideas with him i really want to go do something with him outside of the office i think it would be really fun just because noel and i are genuinely friends we get along very well and so i kind of want to go like make him go do an activity with me or something but yeah it's just a timing thing at this point yeah we have so much going on especially with the ryman show coming up so we need to get it on the books trying to schedule things pretty far in advance but don't worry we'll have them on i gotta get ben on at some point too i think that'll be fun let's see you're going to do a video on ezra miller yes we have one that will be out on my facebook um soon i will probably do a um comment section thing on it if you guys don't follow me on facebook that's where a lot of my not editorial videos go but i do uh big debriefs on like cultural topics and things going on in the news that sort of thing don't really fit under the comment section umbrella i don't really talk about comments there but i'll do you know some reactions i'm talking about the ezra miller basically just a breakdown of something that's going on so it's red cooper daily wire i believe is my user or the username or whatever on that facebook page that's where a lot of those videos are um go join the boomers up on facebook we have a great time so the ezra miller video should be out soon on that one i actually think bobby over here was working on doing final edits on it let's see um just change the acronym to narcissism just get everyone in there yeah honestly that's not bad um what is your general position on transportation do you like high seed rail would you prefer uh more robert moses style investment in highways um i feel like i would probably just stick with highways as of now because the high speed rail is going to be wildly expensive and i also just don't really like p buddha judge so anything that he talks about i'm like basically um obviously i do think that um like government does need to you know i do i am okay with my tax dollars going towards you know maintaining roads taking care of that which is ironic because the roads in nashville are not taken care of at all uh so it's like where where are you spending my money actually um but i don't really i i'm not too i think that we have bigger problems right now and i'm more worried about all of our overspending that i would not be in favor of us taking on some other like huge transportation project it's not in our best interest at the moment i would rather cut down our spending do some rand paul thomas massey plans cut our spending get us back on track and then maybe we can re uh you know adapt take a look see if you know that would be in our future but right now absolutely not we don't need to be spending any more money all right guys uh it is 4 p.m here do you know i remember you guys i told you about this my car got sideswiped a couple of weeks ago and because of biden's america just like with the dog grooming i was not able to get my dog groom so i had to groom her myself um it took until now i think i actually got it sideswiped literally a month ago and i've been driving around without a mirror uh it's in the shop right now so i'm gonna go pick it up and i'm so excited about it because i finally got an appointment literally my insurance they said we can't even get you an estimate for a month and a half and then when i was trying to make an appointment outside of the dealership just to like save some money and do something that i thought would be faster it was like we could get you in july 15th i was like i'm gonna drive around without a mirror a driver side mirror until july 13th they're like we could drive another car it's like i'm twinning you think i have like two cars laying around oh yeah my weekend car no like i need this to get to work so anyway i'm gonna go pick it up i'm very excited i don't really wanna know how much it's gonna cost me but i'm glad that after a month i was finally able to do that so um anyway guys thank you so much for being here hope you had a great week and i hope you have a fun weekend everybody happy father's day if there are any dads in here you guys are incredibly important fatherlessness is real in this country is an important part of our sadly you know depressing culture so if you are a dad thank you so much for what you do go thank your dads uh i'm probably gonna go see mine in chattanooga maybe this weekend so anyway uh happy father's day to all the guys out there and i will see you all on monday alright bye guys", "WRwkPf8d59Q": "what's up guys happy tuesday welcome to my live stream that is apparently going to be about lena dunham because i woke up on this fine tuesday morning and was bombarded with a horrifying photo um i was enjoying sitting here reading the chats about people saying like oh my god one person said groomers are back in style so lena dunham is like crawling out of her cave and that kind of thing uh i thought that was a good one shane sent me a super chat and said can we all agree that just a little hate is needed in situations like these we can't all be lovey-dovey all the time literally as i was trying to figure out i was like should i talk about this i was talking to my producer and i was like should i bully lena dunham well it's like you guys know like she's not just insufferable but she's also been like very blatantly racist about people she outed her sister like i think her sister's some kind of queer or whatever and she like made her come out of the closet or something like that there's also something in her book a very explicit passage where lena's like talking about how she was like exploring her sexuality as a child and like involved her sister in that and like wrote about it in her book and so people were like did you molest your sister like and there's a whole thing and it's just very and she almost like she didn't apologize for anything it was just very very weird um but i do want to i'm so sorry but i do want to show you this photo that was posted um it was the the thing that really has taken storm is this yahoo life article that was written about it it says lena dunham poses poolside in a bikini just stunning this is actually on friday i didn't see it until this morning though um and so this is oh yes sorry here we go hey here's the lena dunham child abuse i was trying to like get my facts straight like you don't want this article to be written about you and here we are okay so avert your eyes listen i don't i don't i don't i really don't care if you want to if you want to put on a bikini that's great i want you to be happy or whatever but like oh what what what is this and she blocks comments she was deleting comments that were saying like oh this is a bit um i don't know and she like has like comment filters on but this just stunning what are we doing here here she is um somebody else are people are saying just stunning now i want to wear a bikini um anyway here's oh my god here's more there was also another one she does these things where they're literally here's the thing she posts these photos intentionally for shock value and almost every one of them has a caption like i'm ignoring the haters and i'm doing it and i'm putting on the bikini and i'm taking this photo so screw you all it's like she knows that like nobody wants to see that it's not like she's in a bikini like at the beach with her friends and she looks joyful like she's having a good time every one of these photos that she posts she looks pissed off and it's like a screw you to her entire audience like i can't believe you don't want to see me listen if you were hanging out with your friends like having a nice time i would scroll and go like okay lina like maybe you are doing mentally better than you were in previous times but no you're still trying to like make the internet deal with all of this look at this like seductive shoulder action like put it away put it away this just my god um so it's but also the fact like this is so bad i'm sorry but on like the mobile version they have like the just stunning why did they just zoom in on her face like listen if i was actually trying to make a point that this was like a beautiful you know photo i would take a photo like she has things where she looks like better like this like that's not an ugly photo she looks she looks lovely there just like that's a nice little whatever feather thing's going on her face looks nice why just zoom in you got a little under boob you got the zoom it's just like come on guys you did her dirty somebody said um does the media ever fawn over fat dudes like this no they don't it's this weird like part of third wave feminism where it's like we we berate men who are you know overweight i mean i guess like guys with like dad bods are sort of in right now in that whole thing so that's different but like overweight guys they're not glorified on like runway shows you don't see them in magazines but there's this whole like angry feminist thing where it's like i'm going to be fat and you're going to think i'm beautiful and if you don't then you're a bigot and this is it's like oh my god i watched a tick tock today of this guy who apparently was that he was telling a story he was at a gas station and i also promised i know i'd like see super chat's coming in i'm gonna get back to him i promise but there was this guy and um i actually just put it on my new i have a new personal tick tock where i'm just kind of like off the cuff reacting to the stuff i see i think it's just brett cooper underscore pretty sure but anyway you'll see it uh but i'm i am wanting to react to it later today anyway this guy's telling a story and he is at a gas station and there's a woman and she's like carrying bags she has a baby and then she has like a smaller kid and then another kid behind her and he like offers to open up the door and apparently this one was like i don't need any help from you like whatever and then they get into this like argument and the woman is basically saying that he's like a sexist for thinking that she can't open the door like by herself that kind of thing it's this angry feminist you know behavior like lena dunham where it's like i'm going to like me posting a picture of myself is a screw you to everybody who might think that i'm unattractive like whatever it is so gross and it's like obviously when i see like my friends and like girls and you know in the media and that kind of thing they're like where are the nice guys like why aren't guys gentlemanly anymore it's like well because you all treat them like crap because you say that if they you know hold a door open for you or you know are wanting a quintessentially you know attractive woman who is healthy who takes care of herself then apparently he is a you know misogynist so we've really done it to ourselves honestly um let's see what else is there a different definition of stunning i don't know about oh that is tough as they say on the golden girls oh let me see um as they say on the golden girls gravy isn't a beverage uh what the f is this fake or are we that far gone no we're that far gone this is when we need jordan peterson back on twitter there was a new sports illustrated cover and he went nope not attractive or whatever and everybody got so mad at him and then he left twitter again and it was obviously like he didn't say it with the right amount of like nuance or whatever but like how much nuance can you have on twitter so i don't really like i don't hold them you know i don't i don't really care but everybody got angry at him because he said that this like very overweight woman on the cover of sports illustrated was not pretty or something like that which i actually thought that she was her face was super pretty um it was a great photo it was just kind of weird that like on the cover of sports illustrated it was that um and so there were with a little more you know time and a better medium he probably could have explained it better but no we are that far gone where it's like the best way to take care of yourself is to lock yourself in your home with a mask on to you know take a bunch of experimental vaccines and you know not leave your house eat a bunch of junk food uh and become overweight because apparently that's healthy i don't even know okay um i'll actually get back to these chats now let's see um what is let's see what is going on we went from paul says we went from showing ankles to kids wearing thongs creating life is portrayed like it's getting a massage and a oh creating life is portrayed like it's getting a massage and abortion is desensitized if this was the old testament we'd all be dead by now uh shaking my head yes oh my god yeah like i think about how in so my ninth grade year i went to a public school um horrible time didn't i left quickly after that i went back to homeschooling but i remember like showing your shoulders was still like oh like that was part of dress code and i remember everybody was so angry about it being like they're you know i can't believe that they're saying that we can't show our shoulders there were literal like dress code protests and that sort of thing at this high school where i was going and i always thought it was so ridiculous but like i laugh at that situation now thinking that people were so you know worried about shoulders it's like do you see the things that like 12 and 14 year olds are parading around wearing now like this entire we live in a hyper like gross sexualized society and that's why it bothers me when i see you know people on like either side of the political aisle just like targeting the other for this kind of like sexualization where it's like people on the right are only talking about you know the drag queens and that kind of thing and the whole like gender theory and then you know people on the left are just pointing fingers at conservatives and like making it they'll there's like this one photo that they always post of like this family with like a bunch of like trump gear on and there's like a woman in like a bikini or whatever they're like look at you and you like took your kids to hooters it's like i don't care whether you're on the left or the right or you're gay or you're straight exposing children to any of that is just gross and creepy i kind of got off of the lena dunham train but i think it's all like sort of connected because it is still like an arm of like the woke sjw crap it still is gross it is still hyper sexualized even though i don't really know why anybody would sexualize that photo that she posted uh it's just a hot mess let's see well person says well thankfully i just took two pepto-bismols i'm okay now since we're talking about the nasty lena donna oh god ben says lena ruining a perfectly good taco tuesday i was sad we didn't have tacos day at work but we did have this thing called like taziki tuesdays which is where we have like greek food so that ended up being good too um james hi james how are you honey do i look fat in this no but also yes oh my god child molesters should be in prison not showcase their fat rolls on yahoo yeah that's yeah that's kind of sad that we have to make that comment there was another oh my god like i said this was not the first photo let me see if i took a screenshot of it like i said every one of these i'm again i'm so sorry for what i'm about to show you but every one of these photos that she does in a bikini where she's like showing all this stuff off is a screw you so i avoid your eyes if you don't want to see like and the caption was something like i'm back you can't like stop me from posting these it's like no we can't but like the fact that you know that people don't want you to should be like a sign of something my god um is a woman spoiler alert i'm pretty sure it's not that thing in the bikini stunning is correct i'm practically in a coma looking at it okay all right you win i wish that we could like we pin like top you won tonight officialpacer1.com that was fantastic uh benjamin says thanks for ruining my date by showing me that photo brett is that danny devito oh my god this is so good you guys are better than most of the comments on those things because i wanted i thought about doing it tomorrow for a comment section and like diving into all of her like weird crap but people were just being like oh like that's kind of weird you guys are actually being funny so you guys are giving me the content that i needed um lena dunham made me gay oh okay is this a game thing uh indica or sativa by the way indica or sativa am i saying something that's bad or weird i have no idea sometimes i worry guys because i'll like i don't know if we're talking about a video game or what we're doing but you're like what do you think about this i'm like i don't know like what i'm reading out loud but anyway um call a girl beautiful 1 000 times and she won't think twice call a girl fat just once and she'll remember forever they say elephants never forget you guys are saying everything that i'm thinking you know it is funny the color girl fat just wants to remember forever i was maybe gosh oh no i just hit my computer um i was maybe 12 or something like that and so you know in the middle of puberty whatever and my mom was making some joke in the car i don't remember how it came up but she was like just wait and i think it was something like uh oh do we need to get you like a i'd like grown out of a shirt or something maybe it was something like that i don't know um and i like made some joke about it i don't know how it came up but anyway i was sitting in the car with my mom and she was like just wait until you're a teenager and i'm going to say anything about your clothing and you're immediately going to be like mom you think i'm fat and i laughed it off and i was like ha ha we would like have jokes about that because she was like listen like i did it too like you're gonna you know your body's gonna be changing all of that and then sure enough i'm you know in high school or whatever and she said something like oh like is that jacket like fitting weird and i was like mom you think i've gained all this weight um anyway that was just an aside but um if you are a teenage female out there i see you and i support you basically um let's see uh james says it's like that article recently oh it's like that article recently a headline said that plus-sized women don't find overweight men oh no i keep scrolling so fast sorry james plus-sized women don't find overweight men attractive women are plus-sized but men are overweight yes well women get the benefit of the body positivity movement because again it's sort of like me too the body positivity movement started out as a genuine social i don't even know what you call it a movement awareness whatever for like love the body that you're in it's you have stretch marks it's okay if you're like you're like it was basically you know providing some kind of humanity to this like post early 2000's where every supermodel was like 511 and a stick and had like the thigh gap and was you know starving themselves that sort of thing because that's also not healthy if you are you know just genetically very skinny that's a different thing but trying to be that skinny i would argue that that is just as unhealthy as like letting yourself go and being overweight because you are obviously denying yourself nutrients that kind of thing and both of them you know require you know taking accountability taking responsibility for your health getting the help that you need whatever so it started as a genuine you know we're just going to love love the skin that you're in and now it's been corrupted by this sjw agenda which is like i'm 400 pounds but you must love me because of the body pause not that you must love me you must think that i'm like sexy and that i'm like the ideal woman because the body positivity movement whatever it's like sure you you're a human being you deserve love like you are you know obviously but to say that that's healthy no it's like it completely denies science you are obviously still a human being and you have people that love you and that kind of thing but they would be doing you a disservice if they were like oh well because of the body positivity movement like you can be you know ridiculously overweight and very unhealthy um but yes but women get the cover of the body positivity movement that is not tacked onto men men are just overweight you are correct uh good point james girl says lesbian here normally don't even expose that nobody says straight here but i've never received hate from the right only from the abc mob because i vote red and i love my guns can't stand i think for me absolutely uh well i'm very happy that you are here and that you don't vote based on identity politics just being able to like step outside of that mob and like the group think of whatever your like identity is like i think that my identity politics would just be as like a gen z female and then like coming kind of coming out of hollywood and obviously that doesn't have anything to do with like my sexual identity or any of that but you are kind of in this group think mob world and having the confidence to be able to step outside of it is just huge so mad props to you we're happy to have you here love it um joe jersey says i'm 40 and in great shape i still rock a one piece just saying yeah it's like i don't know i also the one piece like two piece again wear whatever you want i really don't care it's like your body your life but like why are four-year-old girls in bikinis there's no need for it there really is not it's just like make the ch it's just it's just weird if you're an adult do whatever you want but like with kids i'm like that's just those parents like you are literally asking for attention like you only put on that bathing suit to like get your like you're asking for attention it's just creepy so again it's the same thing of like little four-year-old boys where they wear a little shirt that's like mama's hunk heartbreaker like all the girls love him i'm like he is four no girls are loving him and if they do that's weird anyway let's see marie hey marie how are you um a girl that i knew on my feed would post how fit she was hated on me for trying to give her good feedback for gym cardio she was celiac or diabetic and took photos eating pizza all the time very overweight crazy yeah well there's a lot of people in the world that you know know that they might have a health problem or whatever and obviously will not do anything about it but the moment that you offer any kind of advice i was about to say like criticism but it's not even that of like hey here's something that worked for me then they think that you are attacking them that you are some kind of bigot i mean it's just this whole it's a societal problem truly let's see uh been watching you your vid since the first youtube short keep up the good work it makes you feel like i'm watching a conservative um as mug as oh my god asmon gold twitch stream i don't know what that is but i love it yay twitch i think that's probably some gamer thing but anyway thank you so much juan i appreciate you being here that makes me happy um adrian says uh i've seen lena dunham in a bikini i could stay and blast my brain and not get the image out of it well yeah it truly leaves an an imprint a large one if you catch my drift oh yeah mary says she openly wrote and bragged about touching her sister she's vile she also said that she wish she could get an abortion in women's rights march yes she's disgusting that's the that's the line in her book um that's part of this article that i had pulled up um like oh my god like i'm not even gonna go there but it's and the fact that there's this vox article is like is this scene like child abuse and experts have weighed in like i don't know if it's because like she was like touching her sister or whatever i don't know how you would like you know classify that or whatever it's still weird and it's not something that you publicly brag about as part of exploring your sexuality that's just like keep that private nobody wants to know that's weird and your parents needed to like wrap you up and like fix you and some i don't know it's just crazy all right anyway back to these chats but yes mary that is what um that is what that line was oh i lost my place again james this is the solar eclipse don't look as burning my eyes yes so anyhow the left called conservative science deniers with the rhona stuff but they're not science deniers when they say fat is healthy well exactly because they pick and choose as like most political arguments with them it's like they you know have the moral higher ground on all of these subjects and then they have no principles so they are easily swayed by emotions easily swayed by what is popular easily swayed by what will get them you know more bang for their buck with like taxpayer dollars all of that there's no consistency they don't actually care about the science they just care about winning their agenda um uh indica and sativa are the two main subspecies of cannabis well you can tell that i'm not a stoner if we're talking about wheat here because i had no idea uh i no idea i have no knowledge of any of that so cannot inform you all on that at all let's see is jeremy's razor's a scam all of a sudden there's no talk about it at all and i thought we were supposed to get them by june a bunch of them have already been shipped out uh the first i don't know what percentage of them but uh the first big set of them went out got almost three weeks ago uh so they should be coming out so people are already getting them uh but we just have a ton of other projects coming out right now june is a big month for us what is a woman just came out tara on the prairie is being released with gina carano in just a couple of weeks we announced that earlier today when the actual date is um i believe candace uh has given a date for her documentary we have backstage live in nashville if you want to be here in person we still have tickets for that available i'll be doing some stuff with that you can also meet me at the meet and greet um but that will of course be you know live streams you guys can watch backstage as you usually do if you are a daily wire member um anyway so we just have a ton of projects we are promoting right now but jeremy's racers is actually happening it was such a huge success that like everything internally was like oh my god now we have to like run a razor company uh but yes but people are getting the razors so don't worry let's see brought to us by the same people that voted for sniffer joe and giggles oh my god did you guys see that picture of amber heard and kamala harris and somebody said look it's a picture of shits and giggles that's like the most horrifying cringe photo on the internet um how do we fight back against these groomers continuing to expose them truly um and like this is it cracks me up that this is where i point people to but seriously the things that like alex stein does on twitter that libs of tick tock lives of tick tock is just a powerhouse like she does more investigative journalism and not just like exposing people but she actually calls the school boards if there is you know a drag queen performing she brings it to the attention of the parent she pro like she blasts out that information far and wide she doesn't just stop with the video she says here's the email of this person to call here's that and so i think that is huge um also getting i'm thinking about like you know with the groomers in schools and that kind of thing we talk a lot about you know federal politics and what joe biden is doing that kind of thing but what is going to impact your children in their like local public schools in your community is these you know these local elections being involved with school boards going to school board meetings even if you're not you know a parent with a kid in school going and like figuring out what are these people learning what are they trying to push what are they teaching because that is all going to impact the culture of your community so finding ways to get involved with that but yeah follow what those folks are doing on twitter especially libs of tick tock and just continue to expose them and throw it back in the groomer's faces as much as possible let's see someone just said that homeschooling is lonely i'd like to address that homeschooling is only lonely if you're doing it wrong it doesn't have to be lonely brett could probably work that more eloquently um yes so i have said this before and it's probably one of my most controversial takes i would say because a lot of people disagree with it but i think that if it's done correctly homeschoolers often end up being better socialized than students in like traditional school environments and hear me out on this um when you are in like the brick and mortar school environment in most cases especially with public school you are going through these 12 years k-12 if you don't move with exactly the same sect of kids every single year it's the same demographic it's the same you know you're the same age usually it's very homogeneous with like your race and class and that you are just not exposed to a lot of you know external social environments your extracurriculars are most often through your school system through things in your area when you are homeschooled if you know your parents are doing it correctly because the thing is with homeschooling you are not only taking on your child's education but you are also taking on their socialization which i mean it's what parish should be doing regardless but you don't have a school to fall back on which i honestly think is a better situation as i'm about to explain but because i was homeschooled i had to do extracurriculars outside of you know my school uh what is it called your system what is your like county your district district your school district um and so i did you know gymnastics and that you know pulled in from people from all across the city i did you know tennis with a bunch of other people i took art classes i did tons of volunteering i did community theaters as a result my social life as a young person was incredibly diverse and i hate that the word diverse has been you know adopted by the left in a very weird way because i do think it's very important for young people especially you know diverse diversity of backgrounds of race of age i think age is the most important thing i was around younger people older people i was around tons of adults which is weird to say about a child but because i was doing community theater i was volunteering with my mom at different you know organizations i would go and hang out at my dad's office and be around you know his you know co-workers his you know secretaries that kind of thing um i was constantly having to interact and be social with people who were different than me and i had to you know learn how to be socially adept in these situations where i was not totally comfortable because it wasn't the exact same people every day so as a result i had an incredibly diverse array of friends i met fascinating people that i still you know keep in contact with today and i do think that it made me better socialized now it wasn't that i i will be honest i didn't have a super tight-knit close of friends that i went through k through 12 you know with and i think that's okay like i didn't you know i wasn't you know best friends with the same four people from the time that i was you know in kindergarten i still know a lot of those people but because i moved around a lot and i did different activities and that sort of thing which wasn't the case but i was more socially adept i was more comfortable you know walking into a room you know getting a job at 15 i was more comfortable you know going up and introducing myself to adults i was more comfortable networking i do think that it is why i have had many you know um the career opportunities that i have and that i have had is because i you know was very comfortable walking into a room and saying this is what i have to offer like i want to work here i want to you know be involved so that's a very long-winded and like answer to that um but i was not lonely by any means um i often was busier and around more people than my peers in public school so that's my kind of dissertation on it and obviously homeschooling is not right for anybody but my biggest you know the thing that i if i can you know change anybody's mind it's that if you have you know the ability to homeschool if you are interested if you are concerned about what's going on in our school system and the one thing that's holding you back is that social aspect i would at least like to be able to convince people to reconsider and just think about it and you know be creative as a parent your job is to be innovative to get your kids into you know the programs that they want to get into get them the resources that they need get them around people who will make them grow um and you really you have to take all of that on your shoulders if you are homeschooling them and so it's an incredible responsibility and i'm very grateful that my mom took that very seriously when she was homeschooling me so anyway i can talk about this for hours anyway um on a lighter note about uh lena dunham jeremiah says get to boobs ratio is way off oh my god juan says you and the daily wire gang have to have a show down here in miami now the ben is our neighbor where every gas pump has and i did that sticker i know that would be really fun because ben is down there so we could do a that'd be cool to do a backstage live in other cities we really have just done them i think we've only done one and they've all been here in nashville at the ryman so maybe we'll maybe we'll move who knows not move like where we are but maybe we'll do them elsewhere i don't know acknowledge the super chats please don't be so self-involved literally i've been answering these for the past 15 minutes you probably uh sent that when i was reading by lena dunham so i hope i am pleasing you now by reading the super chats uh my my cat barfed when you showed the overweight woman yeah uh dated dev says love your content but keep it up by the way if you're a fan of the daily wire join the unofficial discord oh that's cool there's like a daily wire discord if you guys didn't know it is uh at dot gg slash daily wire if anybody is interested there's your plug for that thank you so much data dev i appreciate it let's see soon there's going to be a hooters plus waitress as well be plus size male meals and drinks will be huge portions that's the most like america thing i've ever heard that's um he said i've been being my whole life and i've lost the weight i can tell you that obesity is a form of depression people use food it's comfort and a drug to feel an emptiness inside that only jesus can fill um it i mean it absolutely is a i don't know if it would be like a side effect or a symptom maybe both of a you know a bigger issue but i do think it's true because when you take responsibility for your physical health and you make the changes that you need you know to you know live a healthy lifestyle and that sort of thing better mental health does come with that that's why you know when you're in therapy when you're asking people about like asking actual professionals about you know what can i do for my mental health if they are a good professional they will not just shove some drug on you but they will look at first your lifestyle and say are you you know are you spending any time outside are you doing any grounding activities are you walking around with no shoes on and actually like feeling connected to something other than just like a screen and a tv what kind of what kind of food are you eating um one thing that a lot of people don't talk about is that uh sugar and glucose is not only what like cancer feeds on because it breaks down into carbohydrates and cancer feeds on carbohydrates but it also creates massive brain fog again so if you have somebody that you know thinks more broadly than just pharmaceuticals you know if you are you know dealing with any mental health struggles you know your you know psychiatrist or whoever should also be able to say like can you like cut out processed sugar can you eat something that is more low carb can you like get that crap out of your head because it is awful i don't know if it's with your like um like neurogenesis stuff and that kind of thing but it really is awful for your brain and so all that being said yes i totally agree it is both a symptom and a side effect of i think a bigger issue um oh some no a lot of people are jumping in now with the uh in daika and sativa close enough they are the forms of mary jane okay cool you guys just know a lot more than i do apparently let's see um oh no i scrolled too fast where do we go okay maybe that's worth illustrated models into sumo wrestling maybe she is maybe that's her sport that would be fascinating to watch it's going to be a new like ufc thing is going to be like body positive girls fighting listen we already have like the um aren't there like like small people oh that's gonna be the new thing i guess small people fights sumo wrestlers blood wrestling now we got that oh yeah we're adding on that's jello by the way that's my producer let's see okay um when a man wants a woman who stays in shape he's misogynistic about when a woman wants the same she's applauded for having self-respected boundaries yes exactly that's one thing my god okay again back on the feminist stuff if you have you know if you set high standards for a partner if you're a woman and you're saying you know i want a man that looks like this i wanted to make this much money i want him to treat me like this i wanted to be ripped i want to do whatever and you don't turn around and take accountability for yourself and say am i leveling myself up to you know become you know be at the level to attract that kind of person like that's so narcissistic and then to be upset when that kind of man is not interested in you is absolutely bs like if you are you know wanting that for yourself do the work level up and don't just scream and like you know you know i don't know just be angry at men and call it you know misogynistic and sexist if they're not interested in you no they probably just have self-respect and boundaries um that's why i've been doing a lot of ranting on feminism today i hate third wave feminism i truly do let's see uh nathan says brett ontario voted conservative what this is amazing even though 60 of ontario voters didn't vote including me is that uh surprising that so few voted no not at all i mean that happens in america as well do you know what the percentage is of people that don't we have a kind of a sadly low voter turnout but i think a lot of you're looking it up yeah we'll see especially in local thanks federal more people turn out but if we are talking about like um the different states and that kind of thing there is a much smaller you know what it is sheller's looking it up oh he has it okay so this is and from npr okay despite record turnout 80 million americans didn't vote here's why does it say because they're like upset about our failing systems of government yeah basically yeah both sides of the aisle don't trust that their vote counts which is yeah and there's a lot of people who are you know not informed don't know don't really understand things about you know state and local elections who don't feel like but i mean i do think that that is the media's fault because we spend so much time talking about you know federal government um and screaming about you know like the big gop and the big like democratic party that kind of thing big dnc um that i i don't i think people lose hope in local elections and don't see the significance because like i guarantee most people aren't reading like their local newspaper aren't keeping up with local politics but they are you know reading the new york times they are looking at you know washington post oh my god have you guys seen what's going on the washington post right now that's absolute chaos um they're reading those so they're just getting you know angry about big you know foreign global and or federal affairs uh so i think there's a lot of people that just don't know a lot and don't trust that their vote locally does anything so that's my answer for that marcus says fine you will call fat girls beautiful but the next time i drop an epic dad joke i better hear a genuine gut laugh back deal there we go exactly exactly um jack says i love your show and it's a gay conservative it helps i do not like the bs mob mentality any of the groups have what my parents do thank you um thank you so much jack i really appreciate it i'm glad that you are here with us yeah i'm proud of you for getting away from the alphabet mafia mob because they're crazy uh lena admitted that she taught her sister how to do you know what yes it's so she's so gross she's so gross my god let me see remember men you can pretend to be women but you will still need to get a prostate exam until 40 at 40 until next time oh yeah that's true uh we need to make politicians scared of voters again yes we do we absolutely do uh greetings from sweden hello sweden greetings from nashville thanks for being here uh will you ever release your own documentary if so what would you expose i was literally talking about that the other day i was like oh my god every other host has done a documentary like the clock is ticking i got to figure something out um i'm not really sure something that i am very interested in that i don't think has talked a lot about on the pull like conservative side and this is not like saying that i'm doing a documentary or anything but it's just something that i would love to see more conservatives talk about is this mental health crisis especially as it pertains to homelessness because i don't think that either side does a good job of addressing this problem um i prefer the right side of the political aisles like policies as it pertains but i don't think we do a good job of addressing like this issue in our like society and culture um in the same way that i think that the left uses a lot of empty like fluff words and pretending like they're caring but their policies and you know the social social security system and all of that really ends up just keeping people in a cycle of poverty that is very unhealthy um and i have a lot of personal experience with you know family and homelessness so it is definitely a very personal topic to me that i would love to see talked about more so maybe something like that i don't really know there's a lot to expose there's so much corruption so we'll see um fat is healthy you ever seen a fat 90 year old no i have not that's a good point let's see uh hey brett please ask lena to do a somersault in the indian ocean us who live in africa are going through a drought and need water you guys are killing me i love it um no name hey no name how are you i knew it i was wondering where you were because usually you uh send my v the vpn plug at the very beginning of the super chats being up so i appreciate this he says something something expressvpn plug use code ben for three months free there you go exactly one of these days i'll do something with expressvpn and that day maybe no name i'll give you like an actual shout out i'll be like this is for you you're finally getting it you can use code brett um anyway if i were 400 pounds i would identify as lena dunham yeah well oh god um let's see and i keep scrolling down i was not homeschooled as well as you sad i mean i i am very sorry um because i do know a lot of people that did not have you know the same experience and who wish that they had been in a more traditional environment and i do think that it's important that then you know families and children have those conversations of like okay you're 15 now are you liking this setup do you want to try something else that's why i went to public school for one year because i was worried that like i was missing out on this really important quintessential time in my life like i had watched in like movies and stuff and like oh my god they go to prom they wear letterman jackets everybody's like so happy and like dancing through the halls oh my god no that's not what it is at least in my experience it was terrible like i got great grades i made you know good friends but i was so bored i didn't get to do any of the things that i was interested in and i was just like talked at for eight hours a day like wasting my time while other people screwed around that was basically my experience but i do think i was very grateful that my mom was saying you know she was like okay cool if you want to try that if you want to make sure you're not missing out we'll figure out a way to make it happen you don't need to be homeschooled this year um and then again she was i mean she was still very involved and knew what i was learning and looked over the curriculum and that kind of thing so it wasn't just like an offhanded approach um but uh oh my god somebody who i'm looking over at the normal chat and there's like the same question being asked so many times what is this oh do you ever just sit down read your story for the day look at your team and say guys what's wrong with humans this is also a question for the rest of your team we do that literally every day every morning like literally i my brain melts most days and then i don't want to have to do it alone so then i force the entire team to sit around and listen like especially the stories that i don't pick i'm like okay guys i'm not we're not doing this but i do need to like show you this awful photo and they're like brett please like don't make me watch that and i'm like no no we're gonna it's like the terrible like trans tic tocs that i don't end up using but that i think you watch yeah those tick tocks though yeah if you guys haven't seen my like the youtube shorts and that kind of thing that's where the real bad stuff is yes it is yeah katie's in the room right now and she uh she does a lot of she like helps post with the like all of the shorts and that kind of thing so she comes up with the names and so she has to watch all of them and i'm sorry for that it's very depressing not really i'm not actually sorry because i don't want to be alone um anyway that's it um just signed up for college classes broadcasting journalism with a minor in politics at messiah university congratulations i hope you have fun i am such a nerd so i like there's a lot of people when you tell like a more conservative leaning person you sign up for college classes and they're like oh my god the higher education system it's so screwed up i'm like i love academia so have fun keep a good head on your shoulders you are intimately entering into a war zone with that major i will say uh but we need uh people with common sense in there so major props to you let's see why are we ignoring the most important news of the day strawberry frosties at wendy's i don't think i've i've maybe had like one frosty in my life so i'm very sorry is this gonna make people angry if i don't this is a big thing do i need to go after work and get a strawberry frosty i think that's what i'm gonna do all right well we're just gonna take a field trip apparently jonathan says how do you feel about feminism societal roles of women i mean i've complained a lot about third wave feminism i i don't have a problem with feminism as it is in the like dictionary the definition that it was a movement to ensure that the sexes had you know equality in society and you know under you know the governance of law that kind of thing which we do have now like i think that um the vindication of the rights of women women uh by mary wollstonecraft is like that is the epitome of like a feminist text and that's like super nerdy and it's uh probably it's from the 1800s 1700s i believe um but that's like true empowered feminism it was women saying we want to be able to get an education we want to be able to work if i you know want to have a job before i have kids i want to have that right that totally agree with totally on board with i'm very grateful for the rights that i do have um but this whole third wave movement is not about equality it is about you know putting women above men saying that men you know for all of the years that the patriarchy exists or whatever uh that they must basically pay reparations with now the role that they play in society um and that they are inherently toxic it's just a terrible way to move forward in society it's the same thing with like critical race theory where we're teaching you know white kids that like you are inherently an oppressor you need to sit down you need to be quiet that's literally what somebody i've been watching videos of these teachers that are saying yeah part of my curriculum is like just you know take a back seat be quiet don't talk because you are the oppressor and then telling you know black and brown children that you are you know inherently oppressed and you are a victim it's a horrible horrible way to create any kind of productive and happy society because you are you know separating people you're putting them in these ranks um and so it's the same goes with like third wave feminism so i don't have a problem with you know like i said the dictionary definition of feminism but i think that we've gotten there it's like why are people still screaming about it and like the societal roles of women listen it's your life do whatever you want if you want to be a stay-at-home mom i love that that's incredible if you don't want to have children and you want to have a career that's also not my life so go for it i have you know friends that are doing both that have aspirations for both i do have a problem though when people you know make fun or like rip women apart from making that choice it's like i remember my former best friend but i was still in la who definitely does not like me at all anymore because of my political opinions we do not talk anymore but i remember at one point you're talking about like kids and that sort of thing i think she had just like gotten back from babysitting she was like i never want kids like i can't believe like so awful whatever and i don't think we had ever talked about this before but i said you know i actually am very excited to have kids and i definitely want to be a mom and like my mom was a fantastic example of somebody who had a very very dynamic career um and then was able to be a stay-at-home mom but also was never just she wasn't just you know staying at home and like brunching and that kind of thing like she ran like non-profit she was incredibly organized like involved in you know our education she was starting you know extracurriculars for us she was incredibly dynamic and involved she made it a full-time job to like develop you know intelligent independent human beings and i just love that approach because it was so engaged and so i was like no i had a fantastic example of a powerhouse mama that's definitely you know in the cards for me at some point and my friend was horrified she was like you'd be willing to sacrifice your career for like kids you'd want to do that i'm like i'm not saying that i'm going to sacrifice my career i still obviously want to work i love working um anyway so i do think that that is problematic but the whole like society like gender roles i do not care do whatever makes you happy it's not my life to live um uh rick says second try viewing from the netherlands thank you for uh having me be less alone it's hard to find people with similar views here especially of our age you know it's so interesting i didn't realize that there was such a large look at my demographics the other day i didn't realize that there was such a large percentage of people that are outside of the united states so i'm really happy with you guys here i think it's like 60 of my audience is not american um so that's very cool i'm glad that i can you know connect with you guys and i know that it's definitely hard outside it's hard in the united states anyway so i know that it's probably even worse if you are somebody that you know maybe leans right or you know values freedom and independence that kind of thing uh so i'm glad that you're here let's see brett cooper more like base cooper i appreciate that let's see um hey what do you think about the government trying to ban racing because of the climate as a professional drifter this is uh near and dear to home um i did not know that they were trying to ban that but that makes that's on brand for them um my response is that they are just trying to it's all performative like what is you know banning car racing and drifting going to actually do for the climate like our government contributes we actually the united states has done you know great things with like our energy and you know our you know our emissions whatever you want to call it um the biggest contributors are you know china and i think is it china and one other country i believe it's like we're like six on the list or something like that i don't really know but there's like a few other countries that contribute far more than we do and they say like oh we just need to transition over to electric cars we just need to like ban this we need to you know put caps on how much water we can use that is not going to change anything like that is just them trying to control that is just them you know trying to create this climate alarmism so that they can push something like the green new deal through to spend more money to gain more control um so anyway that's sort of my take on it um i obviously care about the environment because it's our earth so why wouldn't i but i don't think that any kind of alarmism that the people that are like gluing their hands to the starbucks counter or you know chaining themselves to things saying that the climate is dying that's not doing anything that is just you know giving the government more power um and the government wanting to spend billions of tax dollars to do performative bs is also not going to do anything um i prefer free market solutions where corporations and companies make better decisions um or try to produce their product in a way that is you know less harmful for the environment something like that but it's like i often intentionally choose to shop with companies that i know are not you know just making things off the coast of china and dumping you know things into landfills as a consumer i can do that so i think that is the solution let's see please tell dunham that walmart has three x bikinis yeah that one also looks like a weird crocheted kind of thing super weird um so that was lena dunham i swear i was looking at a national geographic article on some new species oh god no comment my goodness let's see boy brett a funny pc game you should play as mr president where you have to save trump from assassination attempts oh my gosh that's actually interesting who is this okay oh i scrolled too fast i swear i always mess it up nice seeing a girl my age think like me appreciate it phillip um politicians haven't been tarred and feathered in a while and it shows yeah it definitely does lena versus lizzo is literally war of the worlds that is what i want to see that is the ufc tournament i was talking about lena dunham versus lizzo narrated by cardi b who would you bet on lizzo have you seen her nail she got claws that's true yep she also i feel like two lizzo's credit she sings and she does tours and she dances so i think that her stamina is probably a little higher you know what i mean oh 100 she's definitely still like she's vegan or whatever and she has to do some sort of exercise but i think now she's so like deep into this body positive movement thing and her brand is being like body positive that she kind of has to stay that way yeah that makes sense but she tours and she dances so she's got to have she's got to work on that cardiovascular whatever lena i think that she's too busy just lounging yeah she'd definitely kick lena's ass yeah all right that's it that's what i'm that's my bet guys um let's see um let's see brett i grew up in sc and now i live in washington state never realize how uh socially different they are is that southern california or uh south carolina um i lived in southern california and i lived in washington state but i don't have anything to say about south carolina but yes they are very different uh social i mean just completely different if we're talking about like south carolina and washington state um totally totally different cultures in a way and even southern california and washington state both very leftist but very different attitudes i prefer probably the washington state even though it is like super crazy and lefty um just because it's a little more outdoorsy and i think people are a tad bit more laid back i never really liked the fake you know very materialistic you know types of people in southern california so i really i did enjoy living in washington state that's where i was born let's see he said learn to cook hunt fish meet your local butcher absolutely and guys this is not a conspiracy theory we are having major food shortages christino uh spoke out about it uh was telling you know south dakotans to start you know stocking up on food this is not some like fringe whatever like very mainstream people are talking about like the shortages that are approaching so be responsible like go get some canned things stock up on some flour i'm not meaning like buy ten thousand dollars worth of things but don't have an empty pantry if you're one of those people that like only shops for like the like the next five days or whatever at least get some stuff that is like shelf stable pantry staples in case you like you need something you can't get it especially the stuff that you actually need whether it's like vitamins meds whatever just be cognizant um let's see um thoughts on the joel austin church protest incident that will be tomorrow i hope to i need to do some more research and find if there's any like good video clips but i also want to talk about like his weird like money laundering stuff and all of his weird things cause like that protest is weird but he's also not like the sharpest guy um let's see uh with pen's hook up with rogan what do you ever want to appear on rogan on the rogue experience have invited hell yeah absolutely i love rogan i think it would be a fascinating conversation absolutely down so he says now you have to make a documentary but just know it'll never be better than what is woman i feel like we've peaked we got to keep going up we got to keep going up but no it was absolutely badass you guys have not seen it yet go to what is the woman.com become a daily wire member and go see it that's my plug for the day let's see gary says i love your show but i'm not a very good speaker but i am conservative you always think you feel better listening to your views i appreciate it thank you so much gary um let's see what are your thoughts about the boy scouts the impact the program has on men later in life um my brothers are all eagle scouts my father was a scout leader my mom was a cub scout leader so we are very very deep in the boy scouts i think that they have gone absolutely woke and soft and so i don't really have any really positive thoughts about them these days but they were very very impactful on my brothers and my father's in my mom's life um so back in those good old days i would be very in favor of them and i think it's very important for men to be in environments where you know the boys can be boys and they can do the outdoor activities together and they can learn those skills they can have the camaraderie they can have the brotherhood i think it's very very important um i think it's important for women too but especially for young men like also this is the side thing but it gets me talking about like young men we started just like pushing like wildly diagnosing all of these young men with adhd and we just like you know push adderall on them and all that kind of thing and i want to say like did you ever just think that maybe you should have these guys like go join the boy scouts go run around in a field give him a freaking four-wheeler and say go get your energy out we are not supposed we are not inherently designed to sit in the classroom behind a desk for eight hours a day especially not a 12 year old boy they need to be running around creating things building things and so i think having outlets like that whether it's the boy scouts whether it's like a destination imagination like those inventing things something like not everything is a mental disorder it could just be that our current culture and society is not you know productive and in line with our like biological needs and i think the boy scouts in its you know original you know way of being was really good for that let's see um james says in all seriousness you should do a documentary on your mother you always praise her and she sounds like she's had a very interesting life and is the answer to what a woman is and a great example of one she is fantastic i love that i love she's watching right now i think she's working on her farm she's had a bunch of people at the farm today doing stuff so i don't think she's on today but mom if you see this they want to know more about you i have like tried to get her to she would not want to but like write a book or do something because she has so many people that come to her and are like like especially now that i'm more public there's a lot of people that ask like what did your mom do that was like so different than other people like how did you end up like still being you know more right leaning um but anyway that would be very cool she has a very very special very dynamic woman um ranting ryan says camille vazquez johnny depp's slayer made partner in her law firm yes i saw very very well deserved absolutely deserved um i'm 16 and i've been getting involved in politics including working on campaigns and working with my representatives to solve issues just because i can't vote doesn't mean i can't do something i love this great job emmett that is you're a shining example of a great american um i also think it's important to get involved in like the private sector so working with non-profits getting involved in your community that way and not just doing like the charity like i'm gonna go pet dogs at the animal shelter but really like figuring out what are the needs in my community maybe the government isn't addressing and where are some non-profits that i can support and i can be involved and volunteer in some way um i really loved doing that middle and high school and so that's another option for you but great job i love it um this guy says i'm not thin i'm a trans fat that's good yeah uh do you see that whole thing whereas like there are trans abled people now we not only have like trans race we not only have because there are those people we not only have transgender we don't we know and we not only have people that are identifying as animals we have people that are like physically hurting themselves there's a girl who like dumped like bleach in her eyes because she felt like she was meant to be disabled we live in a sick sick world so to bring it all back to leave the tunnel oh guys

talk to you later", "ZagrWUzpzP4": "what is up guys how are you doing hopefully this is live now i think i've said this before but it always is so weird in like the first 30 seconds because i never know if you guys can hear me or not because there's always the delay so anyway let me know oh there we go i think it's good oh my god hello hi i think you guys can hear me um all right so sorry i feel like i have not done a stream in about two weeks and i was sitting on the live chat as we were like prepping for this and there were people who were like where has she been like the last two weeks like she wasn't doing any streams and i was gonna play portal at first and some people were excited and then some people were like she literally has not been online and talked to us for like three weeks like why she's just gonna play a game uh and the truth being one we were super busy here at daily wire obviously we announced daily wire plus we had backstage june was just an absolutely insane month and so it just was very busy wasn't able to stream um and then my normal producer you guys know him you guys love him producer sheller he's out with coven right now and he is sick as a dog so we have bobby in the house you can say hi if you want hello i have bobby over here so we had to get him up to speed on stuff so that's why we were just going to play a game because it was easier we weren't having to switch back and forth between screens it was going to be easy for bobby to pick it up so everybody um oh my god everybody is screaming at me oh james okay apparently there's an echo of my audio trailer's gonna help me with that okay guys uh thanks james let me uh we will figure that out like i said guys putting this together but uh give bobby a nice and grace because sheller's the man who normally knows how to like run all these things he's their tech whiz um oh my goodness you guys are spamming it two audio sources somebody's saying it's two audio sources i listen y'all i know i'm very aware that it's echoing you don't need to keep spamming it but i appreciate um i appreciate your concern i think that might have fixed it i think we got it how is it now somebody said echo makes brett sound like an autobot deception's forever is this better let me move this away to mike slay bobby somebody's saying yeah everybody give bobby a good welcome oh my god better fixed fix oh my god wonderful all right you guys spammed it well welcome back to the comment section um perfect well thank you guys for sticking with us uh for that anyway hello happy tuesday um excited to see you guys again excited to be back doing this i really do like doing these streams it's very fun um this whole community just grows every single day and it's absolutely wild so i appreciate the guys who have been here you know from the beginning and all of the new folks um so anyway i wanted first to talk about i don't know if it's like the hot issue right now it's like adjacent to it so obviously elon is backing out of his 44 billion twitter deal i did an episode on it today will be out shortly but uh twitter did not disclose the information on the bots and the spam accounts that elon wanted in order to move forward with the agreement so he had his attorney send a letter and they said we're backing out of it um and then twitter basically said screw you they clapped back their chairman said we're gonna go through with it we're gonna you know bring legal action my thought was they need to call camille vasquez who was the lawyer in the amber herd johnny depp trial get her on board and live stream the entire thing hopefully bring some elon drama but all that you know love and war whatever that elon stuff is still going down but the other side of the story is that trump is somehow inserting himself and getting involved because you know i love the man but he definitely has a big ego and he wants to be involved in basically everything so um i'm going to pull up oh i know where is it hello why can't i find it all right here i'm pulling this up it's up now um oh my god go back have you guys seen this clip we're going to watch it anyway even if you haven't but this was on saturday in alaska this was as all of this stuff with elon was happening and this is what trump had to say about the whole thing okay another one of our highest priorities under a republican congress will be to stop left-wing censorship and to restore free speech in america and go out by the way while i'm here and sign up now for truth social it's hot as a pistol and you see that i call that one right leon i tell you what elon elon is not gonna buy twitter where did you hear that before from me [Music] from a fake account she says fake a lot of them nah he's got himself a mess you know he said the other day oh i've never voted for a republican i said i didn't know that he told me he voted for me so he's another artist but he's not going to be behind it he's not going to be buying it although he might later who the hell knows what's going to happen he's got a pretty rotten contract i looked at his contract not a good contract my god there's so much to unpack here um first of all elon responded in another thread and was like no i didn't vote for trump and i never told him to and trump never looked at my twitter contract so i don't really know trump i don't know what you're talking about um and let's see so then elon responds and he says i don't hate the man but it's time for trump to hang up his hat and sail into the sunset dem should also call off the attack don't make it to the trump's only way to survive is to regain the presidency i honestly i don't know where you guys stand on it i liked president trump i was happy with it i personally i don't want him to run again i just i think that it would be i think it would split republicans like straight down the middle i think we are at like a turning point where if somebody like desantis ran we could really unify and take things back and i think that trump running would really just divide it down the middle and i think that he's i mean one i do believe partially that he you know has this country's best interest at heart but he gets attacked violently still every day he has been banned on every social media platform you really only hear from him on truth and through his you know press releases and that kind of thing and the left still attacks him on a daily basis establishment republicans still attack him on a daily basis everybody and their mother still has trump derangement syndrome basically um and so obviously the man wants to redeem himself people could just cool the hell down realize he's not the president anymore and move on probably would be better for all of us and trump could just enjoy golfing in mar-a-lago and nature would take its course and we would all go back to some like unified whatever trump would be happy on his private jets doing whatever he wants to do i said nature take his course that sounds like he's gonna die i don't think he's gonna die he's not that old yet um he's doing better than find this uh anyway then elon says trump would be 82 at the end of term which is too old for a chief executive of anything let alone the united states i do agree with that if desantis runs against biden in 2024 then desantis will easily win he doesn't even need to campaign but i don't think biden is going to run in 2024 i think that's basically off the table did you guys see that newsweek article um where it said that in a race between kamala and desantis kamala would win that was such no nobody likes her she has an even worse approval rating than biden does i'm pretty sure she did a couple of weeks ago and she had a terrible approval rating coming into being the vice president she is insufferable even the people that are like hardcore liberals can't stand the woman she had all of her staff like quitting within the first few months of the presidency like i just that's an absolute lie i don't see that happening at all i don't know who could bobby who would be like who would actually run on the democrat ticket but tulsi wouldn't absolutely not how about gavin newsom oh god i forgot about that damn it oh okay wait i'm gonna go back to chat um let's see am i back on there is this am i going to go back yeah oh cool um sorry i was dealing with some stuff here uh i forgot about that you know they did just do that uh california did like a hit piece on florida basically and i think desantis clapped back but i forgot that that sounds speculating oh my god he would be awful that's just disgusting uh i hate newsome i mean i did used to live in california and so i've seen his policies firsthand and it's just terrible um let's see james says hey now that that is fixed hi reckon us brits get a congrats for pojo resigning yes congratulations boris johnson no more congratulations to the brits let's see beam how are you a new breath stream how refreshing but not as refreshing as a quality night sleep with bowls and branch bed sheets you should be over 20 off there you go exactly uh or you can you know buy some steaks from good ranchers you can also buy some skin care you can also buy some blue light blocking glasses from bon charge use code cooper look you have all of these options guys so many products that are just gonna make your life better you're gonna be healthier because you're eating grass-fed steak from america your skin's gonna be clear and you're not going to have eye products anymore literally all of the things that i like get sponsored by are making your life better i don't know how many creators can say that but i genuine i actually like use all of those products so that's dope anyway okay um is it a bad time all right peter says it's a bad time to be called peter uh pedo peter yeah it's like everybody who was named brandon that was not a good time for you either um but yes i mean have you guys seen all the hunter biden stuff i did an episode on it yesterday which was semi i don't know if it was really controversial but i made an argument that i usually don't see in right wing circles which was that i had a tinge bit more empathy i think for hunter biden i think that okay i'm just going to do this really quick there's biden as the president and then there's biden as a father the two are not necessarily like mutually exclusive but i do think that they should be looked at somewhat separately like obviously they do overlap but i don't think that just looking at photos of like coked out and cracked out hunter biden is the most productive thing i would rather know about their family's dealings and the stuff that he was involved in there rather than focusing on like oh here he is in another like sound bath being naked like obviously the man has serious serious problems i don't know what this addiction comes from whether he was abused whether he has some kind of you know trauma whatever maybe biden was the cause of it we really have no idea but if somebody that lives in a family with serious addiction with serious you know mental illness where i have had to be in the position like i said in my video yesterday where i have had to call the police on family members and get people into rehab and that sort of thing none of it is pretty and so in a way just blasting those photos everywhere it just makes me sad because it reminds me of like being in those situations i just don't want to see it i don't think it's helpful uh and i would rather focus on the other ways that biden is destroying the company or not the company probably his own companies i don't know um but the way that biden is destroying the country on his own without the help of hunter biden's naked gross images that's my that was my whole take on the thing you can watch the episode if you would like but yes some of those texts that came out were gross and i mean we've all known that the guy was nasty and has been involved in many illegal the use of many illegal substances and prostitutes and all that stuff so it's not really a surprise i'm just kind of tired of it and would like to hear some more i don't guess juicy details i don't know let's see um okay moving on oh boy i missed some of these okay have you seen the boys on amazon i have not uh when it first came out i heard like mixed things about it well i know people liked it a lot but it just seemed semi-gory and you guys know i don't really one i don't do horror and two it just seems very violent and aggressive i don't really love that stuff i'm not trying to be like i'm a girl and i don't want to watch that stuff it's just i don't know it was just never really of interest to me maybe i should because i know people like it um male shapiro at it again female shapiro guys let's see having a rugged president is a good thing if you get a squish if you got a squish you'll get a bunch of kindergartens uh running the country like now yes exactly i agree um oh this one's a hot take let's see uh brett were you ever offered drugs while working in hollywood and did you take any no um well no i have never i've never done any drugs um but i yes was offered some i mean most mean a huge a ton of people in my life use drugs um some not so well i did just say that there were addicts in my family but um moving on sorry there's the dark humor there but no it is very very common in hollywood i mean especially like the most common one is weed like everybody smokes weed um and so much other stuff a big one out there as well is like tripping on shrooms and that kind of thing a lot of people have like you know they're big awakenings and if that works for you go for it i was never holding it against anybody but it was never something that i was interested in just because i have seen um you know things take place in my family that i really didn't want to be involved in and that was not the path that i wanted to go down so i have made the choice to not have that be part of my life um but it is pretty common out there that's it going through a separation with my wife currently uh prayers she finds it in her heart to come back thank you for the videos they have helped so much i'm so sorry to hear that justin everybody usually we like wish people happy birthday and that kind of thing but send some love to justin right now um because he needs it and i'm glad that the videos can bring some sort of light maybe some humor but i'm very sorry that you're going through that because breakup separations all of that stuff it is hard on everybody um so everybody send justin some love okay uh thoughts on the james webb telescope okay y'all i do like the photos they okay this is very weird and i haven't said this to anybody yet but i was looking at some of them and they're so high quality so there was this one and it was like this cloud i don't really know what it was but it literally looks like a painting of some sort and it made my brain tingle like is that weird i know that that's kind of a common thing at least in gen z where it's like oh that like is like tingly or whatever i don't it's like a weird like phrase that's going around now but anyway it literally it was just beautiful and i loved it so i love the images i think space is fascinating i know barely anything about it so i really don't understand the complexity or what any of this means other than these are new like high-res photos i guess clearly i probably sound very uneducated on this topic but the weirdest thing was i didn't know that they basically did an entire variety show like debuting the images and biden was there and they had these women that were like ooh you saw a sneak peek of the photos and you saw the first one that was leaked and then they had people like why was biden sitting at a little desk looking at the big screen like it was so weird i was like is he back in like elementary school so if you get a chance go look at some of those videos because it is honestly very strange it felt a little cultish in a way i was like imagine being the president and we we have all of this crap going on in our country your husbands or not your husbands oh god um your son's crackhead photos are being exposed all over the internet your wife just called hispanics diverse tacos and yet your communications department is like all right come on president biden go sit at this little desk and we're going to look at like pictures of stars you know i was saying that and i was going to make fun of it but honestly with how biden's brain works that's probably the best thing for him to do is to just sit in a little chair behind a desk and just look at some pretty pictures maybe it made his brain tingle as much as it made mine tingle or whatever um let's see oh god people want me to play halo i'm seeing i saw a bunch of stuff pop up in the chat we were talking about that earlier because i did see some comments where people were saying why are you playing old boomer games and producer sheller is gonna be triggered about that because these are all of his very favorite games that i have been playing but i do agree i would like to play halo i think i should play call of duty i will do it for you guys i don't have an xbox here at my studio but i will get one i will set it up i think i need an xbox for those right yes yes great i'm going to get it set up and i will do it for you i also don't like the current setup where if i'm playing a game i can't see your super chats come in or see the chat at all and so it feels very separate like i'm kind of a freak in a zoo and you guys are watching me stumble around making myself look like an idiot i would rather you be involved while i make myself look like an idiot um so i'm going to work on that too i think i need to work with like the streamlabs software and make sure that i can you know see your comments and interact and respond to them because then you know then we're in it together and it's like community it's not just me looking like a fool but anyway yeah i will do it let's see um have you seen the photos or released from the telescope update yes i have a comment section with brett cooper rocks thank you so much i really appreciate it let's see if you don't like violence and you won't like terminalist thought it was great i know but i want to watch it okay so zachary you sent that one in here's the thing uh the husband of one of our execs is actually in it and they are like wonderful family friends of mine they're basically like my fake mom and dad here in nashville um and so i am going to watch it because i love him and i love chris pratt and the left hates it so obviously i need to watch it and if there's like a gory scene i don't know i'll just it'll be fine i just i will watch it if it's like a specific thing that i already have a vested interest in or if i have a friend that's in it or something like that but i don't just sit down and like turn on something where i know there'll be a lot of blood or whatever you guys also know i don't watch a ton of television like i don't even really subscribe to netflix i think i have some like old friends login that i might not even be friends with anymore i don't even know whose account it is but i like have it on my chrome browser that i can pull it up i've literally used netflix that infrequently that i haven't even bothered to sign up or get a new whatever i've never paid for it in my life so anyway i don't i'm not just sitting around like binging a bunch of stuff so if i gonna watch something it needs to be pretty specific okay uh lou castle thank you so much i really appreciate it thank you for the super chat um hugs back to you let's see oh okay moonshine parallelogram you said those photos of hunter are about as flattering as a zoom call with jeffrey tubin oh okay if you guys don't remember that whole situation that was during covid during the era of zooming and uh jeffrey tubin he's seen it right yeah he was a cnn uh was in a meeting and did not realize that he was on camera and on audio and started what is a good way to say that i guess it's fine he just started masturbating on on the camera and no other way to say it yeah i was gonna say i think that there's like innuendos for it but i think the easiest way because i'm not feeling creative right now let's just say that um so he was suspended for a bit and then it was so awkward because he got his job back and they did this interview with him and they were it was like all of these women and they were like so jeffrey you're back like do you want to tell people what you did and what you learned and it was just so uncomfortable and they had to like fake laugh about it anyway um yes they are they're obviously like less or like more unflattering than that because there was a bunch of drugs and weird stuff my favorite one of the hunter biden thing the only one that i thought was kind of funny is that he was in like this it's in the video that i did he's sitting in what looks like one of those like egg sound bath things i don't know if any of you guys have done them i'm i don't think i'm claustrophobic but it does weird me out you sit in like a tub like an egg thing and you're naked and there's like weird lights in it and you're supposed to like float and vibe basically and i i'm like some people say they're like oh it's like being in a womb or whatever the whole thing is kind of weirds me out maybe some people are really into it i don't know like more power to you if it is but it looks like he's in one of those he's smoking crack or whatever he's doing he's got a white claw it's like the worst ad for whiteclaw ever but it is kind of funny and all the comments were like okay every other photo was gross but like i could vibe in this like guys this is still like disgusting uh okay it's a petition to send brett on a ghost hunt i would do that i actually would do that i like ghost tours i did one recently when i was in austin not recently i guess it was like the end of the fall but that was super cool but i do like that stuff i haven't done one in nashville yet oh that should be a video yes we're doing some fun definitely new content okay here's an assignment for you guys let's ask them about names for this all right i'm going to pay attention to the chat very closely somebody said yeah sounds like a sensory deprivation tank yes like that i call them eggs i think they look like eggs okay um so we are going to start doing some like non-traditional comment section content meaning i'm not just like you know covering social media and new stories and pop culture and that kind of thing we kind of call them evergreen content because they can last forever you can come back to them in a few years and watch them but it's also just me trying to it also feels weird saying this on a live but show more of my personality in a way because there's only so much that like i feel like i can interact with like the outside world and that sort of thing in just like the normal comment section format so you know i had you guys send in if you were on my instagram and on tick tock i had people send in like embarrassing stories and i was like i will tell some of my embarrassing stories and we'll react to yours so that video will be out soon anyway we're doing like this like bonus content and in my mind it reminds me of like nick at night or like comment section after dark but that seemed like weird so anyway if anybody has any name suggestions for what this like weekend i think it's gonna come up on weekends or we'll like i'll publish it late at night or something like that if anybody has any fun names let me know because i would like it to be you know branded and cool but i've been having a creative block so just know that those videos are coming and they're going to be coming out but i want to like have a cool name for it and be able to categorize it so if you guys are more creative than i am in that sense let me know um and then bobby will take that and run with it because he's helping me with a lot of those videos so maybe we'll do a ghost hunting one i would love to do a ghost hunting one great you guys should also be excited because we i might actually finally learn how to ride a bike and we'll film it that's definitely happened that was um a couple people on my team didn't realize that i actually really didn't know how to ride a bike and they said oh my god why have we not done a video on that soon because that is your most embarrassing story not the fact that i like my pants fell down in an indian buffet which is the one that i told on tick tock but the fact that i can't ride a bike is the most um cooper's corner let's see oh okay some of those are weird the vip something like that okay they're actually the cooper landing okay there's a bunch of stuff all right we'll see i'll go i'll go look at these in a minute let me get back to these super chats um brett you need to identify as a man and run for president when you're 35 why would i oh oh wait no not identify as a man identify as a 34 year old or a 35 year old um i always appreciate it when people say that i would rather drag myself over hot coals than be in the federal political sphere underground comment section oh that's kind of funny let's see bread blooper after dark i'm seeing fun times and comments hi brett cooper unchained let's see somebody okay the the brett shapiro show living my bret life out of studio uploads off the clock oh off the clock's kind of fun red cooper i like off the clock that's a good one guys you're sick i love this um okay you guys are oh bret unplugged coupe all right okay i'm going back to the super chats i appreciate this continue if you have any you know big names people you can do whatever put them in there i'll catch up all right let's see for justin heart heart nitrogen fume okay uh let's see uh oh yeah that was for justin we're all sending you love um okay brett did you hear let's see but did you hear uh there would be headed uh innocent hindus on video and time magazine blamed hindus instead all because hindus and mahdi love trump mask oh max gaslighting i have not seen that i'll look up that story um a minute let me don't you don't need to share my screen i just want to make sure that i can read this later um i have not been up to date on that but i will take a look at that and read oh wow interesting okay that was a couple of weeks ago i will read that and try to stay up to date on that thank you for bringing it to my attention let's see i am an author living on long island new york and a fan of your show thank you for the informative and entertaining videos thank you so much michael i really appreciate it i hope all the writing is going well and i hope you're not too uh sad stuck living in new york with those crazy people but long island is cool let's see um are you tired of being high no name how are you uh no name today says are you tired of being called a taco fix it by signing up for expressvpn use could bend for three extra months free i actually just finally got my new like uh vpn setup with expressvpn uh which is very cool so i actually do use it guys so go sign up evil brett be like i don't think biden's that bad i do think he's awful if that was in regards to some of the like hunter biden stuff i think biden is awful but i clearly don't really know what goes on in their family so i can't speak to that i also feel like it's so there's all of these people and i feel like they kind of get high and mighty about their families and maybe there are people out there that really do have like the cookie cutter like very very perfect families but i feel like if we're being real like everybody has some sort of like skeletons in the closet and one thing that i mentioned on the show yesterday was you can be an exceptional parent and you can still you know have kids that you know make bad choices you know things happen to them that that sort of thing i mean my family is a really perfect example i think i turned out pretty solid my mom's fantastic but i do have a brother that you know has significantly you know had struggles i have a brother who died um and so i just it's very the family stuff is so complicated and i don't think it's black and white and so i always want to be careful to not just like slap another label onto biden like he's exposing himself for being awful every day he's senile it's basically elder abuse he's making a fool of himself in his job i don't need to like dig into like what he did as a father i guess but maybe he was good maybe he was bad i don't know i just wouldn't want my family's dirty laundry exposed without any contacts so i don't know that's just my thought but maybe i'm being too empathetic i don't know um let's see you should see the new washington post article a new studies show mutter crack cocaine use not a cause for concern i did see that that was entertaining there was an edit or there was like a photoshop one where it was said something like that and then it was like contributing author hunter biden which it would be hysterical if that was real and the fact that so many people believed that the one with like hunter biden was real goes to show i mean and i even was like at this point in 2022 with where our media is that is not unbelievable to think that as all of this is happening the new york post be like sure we'll have hunter by and write something to basically protect himself and his image let's see um okay the soprano should be mandatory viewing for every blue state beta male teenager rite of passage also uh the boys is an anti-american watchman clone no idea what american watchman is uh or watchman is anti-american watchmen is that something i should know watchmen just the film oh okay i'll look it up um like i feel like i let you guys down what do you guys ask me about like video games or movies or stuff that i should know but i have seen the sopranos and i do agree with you on that it's a badass badass film actually my brother reed i think it's probably his favorite tv show ever um so he was the one that encouraged me to watch it i thought i just slurred all my words there encouraged me to watch it let's see um emily said so glad i found your channel a few months ago i used to be on the left but you've opened my eyes to so many great points and how stupid the left is thank you so much for being here emily i really really appreciate that um i mean one thing that i've said a lot is that i am very grateful that this channel and the subscriber base and all of you guys that there is a very significant like i don't know there is a lot of ideological diversity here which i love because i feel like because of that i'm able to make more nuanced points and arguments i'm able to say the stuff that i just said about hunter biden and not have like an entire you know establishment republican base yelling at me because i'm not immediately slandering something that biden does i'm able to i feel like just be more myself and real and not feel like i'm boxed into anything so i appreciate you being here um i'm glad that you've opened your eyes about some things the left is very crazy um but everybody has a journey and growth or whatever and i'm just happy that you're here i'm glad you enjoyed the content so thanks for being here emily let's see what do you think of ancient greek philosophy like socrates um i've read a fair amount of it i really like it it is very saying that you like i like ancient greek philosophy feels like a very empty comment um it's incredibly incredibly influential and i don't think a lot of people are reading those works anymore or understand their significance when it comes to like our modern day political philosophy and that sort of thing because even though we are not taking you know word for word what aristotle or socrates said we're not living by them anymore their philosophies it's kind of like a trickle-down philosophical whatever inherently influenced so many things in our daily lives and what academics are teaching what is happening in government and politics and so being able to read those and go back to it it is a very good foundation that kind of helps you understand like the core you know foundation of being like a collectivist or you know acting uh in accordance for the greater good rather than for individualism it just provides you with a very solid foundation so i would encourage anybody um if you are not well versed in that um and it is intimidating i think to pick up those works but there are ways to find like you know the spark notes version of it find what you're interested in and then dive in there but it has been very influential to me one of the best classes that i ever took one was ethics i did that freshman year of college i believe and then sophomore year i did a political philosophy class where i worked with a lot of those types of philosophies and philosophers it's just like fascinating and there were a lot of people in the classes that were bothered that they were there because they were saying like how is this not applicable to like our modern world like this is so boring but i was fascinated by it so anyway that's my like nerding out for the day so i think that they're very important um even if we are not interacting with those works every day and it's sad that those that they aren't really taught in normal you know university curricula anymore unless you are studying the ancient greeks unless you go out of your way it's the same thing with shakespeare in a lot of you know classic works of literature the left has argued that these works are inherently racist or sexist or that because shakespeare wrote women in this way he should not be taught in the traditional classroom or if he is taught it must be through the lens of like an intersectional feminist whatever like why can't we just read these works for what they were it is not that difficult to try to put yourself in shakespeare's shoes in you know that time period and realize that he was writing literally at that time i mean it's not it's it's so simple but the academic left has made it so that that is all way too offensive and sensitive so anyway there's your nerding out for the day let's see um datadev how are you uh okay guys so datadev runs i don't know if you run it i actually need to figure it out um but letting everybody know on the stream there is a discord server for daily wire fans it's just the invite is just daily wire if you want to go join if you are a daily wire fan here i know some people are subscribers or not but if you want to be a part of it go check it out datadev is here for every stream um always drops that so go join if you're interested let's see oh no paul says i so love your portal streams you are as good as portal as i am at relationships my wife agrees see that could either be like a very good thing or a very bad thing but considering that i know how terrible i am at portal that's all i'll just no comment no comment um uh young biscuit says sure what do you mean by this one minute hold on hold on wait i scroll down okay please throw a bag of salted peanuts at my forehead no no but sure i mean that's not the worst thing but if that's what you're into that okay i guess um let's see okay i sent an instagram dm of an irish politician slagging american democracy would love a reaction guy's an idiot dressed as a clown um all right i will go check it out if you sent it recently um let me know peter why don't you re-dm that to me but like like bump it up to the top and i'll check it out after the stream because a lot of stuff gets like bogged in and i can't really find it so i'd like resent it to me and i'll check it out um let's see hunter biden is literally on blackmailable imagine your job is to find dirt on him what could you possibly find that he hasn't recorded himself doing it uploaded to the internet himself that is true honestly maybe he is the one playing 4d chess he was like listen i know i'm doing all of this crap and i'm just gonna go ahead and make it foolproof nobody can you know come at me because i'm exposing myself it's kind of but you know what um let's see hey brett do you have moderators to limit the spamming in the chat i'll be more than happy about moderating only for this issue we often do um but not today it is just bobby and i and so he's running all the other stuff so we don't have a moderator today sadly hopefully the spams haven't been too much i haven't been checking it as i try to i think sheller might actually be on it oh wait cheller is yeah oh sheller you need to step it up so sheller's at home like i said um uh sheller is at home with kovid and apparently he is on the stream virtually moderating so sheller i think you just called got called out i think you need to moderate harder maybe i don't know anti-censorship here um everybody say hi to sheller and tell him to feel better that's what we're doing now okay um let's see him i refuse to simp but i can never look at benjamin the same again joking aside congrats to you making waves thanks so much cody i really appreciate it i do get that a lot of people are like oh like i can't look at you or ben the same way now that you like look like it's strange but anyway yeah okay um okay brett ever play any dungeons and dragons or any tabletop role-playing games since an actress you'd have a blast i and my actor friends are in the process of creating a streaming tabletop show with heavy gospel themes that's super cool i have not but i think it does i think the dungeons and dragons sounds very cool i've always been a bit intimidated by it i don't know why um oh i love this everybody's saying get well sheller that's so cute uh i love it we love you sheller um i think i've just been intimidated by it because my friends that have played it have been like super super into it and i just didn't really want to break into that world but i should i feel like you probably play dungeons and dragons right don't you bobby i've i've never played it what nope oh my god you're not as much as a nerd as i thought you were gonna be i need to talk to carter and scheller about that i guess okay i'm sure played i have some other ice people on my team that i can talk to about that don't worry i'm going to work on it let's see team relaxing drink if they're still cheap enough what is this oh having a relaxing drink was that part of the hundred buying stuff maybe um okay so this is a name for the after dark stuff the cooper trooper show that's good i do like the off the clock i like that one too that's kind of fun because then it it's like okay i don't know who came up with that but that was whoever it is let me know so i can give you credit but that was dope okay um wait you can't ride a bike n well here's the thing guys so i don't need to go i don't wanna i don't i don't wanna explain myself but um after many years of obviously not being able to ride a bike i was i was on a vacation with my family in 2020. horrifying i know we went out while the virus was going but we were in yosemite and my mom said it is embarrassing that it was i 19 18 at the time um oh no 18. um it was two years ago she said it's embarrassing that at 18 we're all going on a family bike ride and you don't want to go because you can't ride so you need to figure it out and there weren't a ton of people at yosemite because obviously it was in the middle of covid so it was the perfect time to go so we all went on a bike ride and i got a little more comfortable so my update is i can go in a straight line holding on for dear life without people around but i have noticed because i did try to ride when i went on vacation i remember where i was i was in some city oh i was in dc that was the last time that i rode a bike when i was in dc covering the uh pro-life march and the anti-vaccine mandate one i had just finished it was so cold oh my god that whole thing in january it was freezing cold and i had just left the anti-vaccine mandate um march and all of the ubers were ubers all of the ubers were gonna take like 25 minutes and my hotel was like a 30 minute walk away i said i should just walk but then i was too cold and my team had to leave like five minutes prior to like run to another shoot and i had like said i'm gonna wait a friend of mine was speaking we'll win and so i wanted to see him talk anyway so i was just there by myself and wasn't gonna go with anybody so i said you know what i'll get on i don't trust myself on the scooters but i did learn how to ride a bike a year and a half ago so i will get one of those and i'll try to ride my bike back to the hotel terrifying guys it was absolutely terrifying so i can go in a straight line but having other people around pedestrians the death of me other bikes no having to turn can't do it so i can balance can i ride comfortably no so bobby's idea is that we do like levels basically and i start like i'll ride around the parking lot and then we'll go out into nashville and we'll do like courses like challenges okay like brett on the greenway brett trying to ride through broadway maybe i don't know they're probably gonna end up like throwing fruit at me or something to see if i can dodge it the stuff that they have planned for this off the clock after dark whatever i'm not gonna lie i might be tortured so anyway that is my explanation for the bikes that's all that's all i want to say on the subject bobby's so excited about this okay um brett you did a video talking about machine gun kelly and travis barker saying you don't like noodle men uh if a man lifted weight knew how to fix and had a good job would you care if he was nerdy oh my god i would prefer it if he was nerdy i was not noodle men does not mean that like no i'm not looking for some kind of you know chad like frat boy meathead whatever love y'all to death but i genuinely i do love nerds like the dorky like funny guys absolutely great um but no what i meant by noodle men is that like a lot of these guys they literally just look strung out they're they look malnourished it's not that they don't like hit the gym or whatever it's that they literally look like they're malnourished and they feed on leftism and social media basically smoke a ton of weed that kind of thing not my ideal whatever but no so that is not having to be like nerdy or whatever um so anyway um let's see okay you should do a video on skydiving those videos are funny yes that's what i said i have done i've been skydiving twice i did it twice in one day i went up first and i loved it and then i basically begged my way onto the plane again um one of my brothers decided not to go at the last minute so we had an extra ticket and the people were like oh you can come back another time and i was like take me up right now so i did it twice back to back and i suggested that we go skydiving and one of my other producers sean was like uh uh like i'm not doing it like you would have to pay for the the skydivers to like do the camera stuff but we're not gonna do it but i would absolutely do it okay let's see um can we get honks for the dutch farmers absolutely the dutch farmers absolutely crushing it if you guys don't know what is going on uh the dutch government basically said that they are putting new regulations onto farmers they are it's part of their whole like zero carbon emissions thing they're reducing the amount of livestock that they can have down to basically i don't wanna say inhabitable numbers that's not the right word for it but reducing their livestock to the point that they will not be able to run a business they will not be able to turn a profit and they will not be able to feed the dutch people um and so they are rising up they're bringing all of their tractors to the capital their protests popping up in germany and in italy i don't know if there's any here yet but this is part of a larger global movement to crush traditional industry for the sake of environmentalism and you know the zero carbon agenda whatever i think it's connected back to the world economic forum and the whole great reset thing where they just want us to you know eat fake processed food and eat bugs and that kind of thing um but it is going to leave the dutch people hungry it is going to create a food shortage it is just a absolutely ridiculous um move and i mean it's a very normal thing in politics and in government and you will see this trend if you look at policies being made most things in government they have an intention they're like oh we're going to do this for the greater good we want to have this we want this effect they don't actually look at the unintended consequences that come with a policy that come with like a new proposal whatever they're always looking 10 years ahead of like this is gonna happen like this is going to be the long-term whatever they never look at the immediate how is this going to impact our day-to-day functioning it's the unintended consequences um and the unintended consequences of this stuff in the netherlands is going to be a food shortage so yes dutch farmers they deserve all the honks they deserve all the support because they're a badass um somebody said i should have sent in my embarrassing story of potty training my toddler i've been doing that this week but i sent in one uh being a nursing mom listen you can dm me anytime with embarrassing stories i'll send you back some i've got plenty uh but house training a toddler sounds exhausting happy that you're on the stream um but major props to you i hope you're doing well um let's see do you stream games on this channel if not where and halo is on the pc uh the master chef collection yeah we do stream on this channel um i don't stream on twitch i just keep it here i was going to do portal today but like i said i felt like i should you know just hang out with you guys and people were being pressed about me playing old school games so anyway um i'll do some halo soon have you seen the howie mandel video on twitter i have not i'll look at that um no name says for some reason i think it would be kind of entertaining if you pulled noles along to a ghost hunt there you go all right that's i've actually been wanting to figure out something fun that i could do with nols out on the town i think that's perfect all right great i love bobby just like quietly like comes in with like a two-word response we're getting them comfortable on the mic anyway all right yeah that's a good idea is there any way to get a tour of the daily wire a million subscribers you should raffle a chance of spending the day with you at the daily wire that's cool we just do have you know you know protocols here and that kind of thing um but with uh candace prior to her you know going on maternity leave we did have people you know come in and see her show so we have done that before i'm not sure you know how that all works but who knows uh but i we are planning on doing some like day in the life videos so you should get uh that'll be part of the like off the clock after dark whatever this is going to be um so you'll be able to see some more behind the scenes then let's see i'm excited about jordan peterson joining the group is there anybody else you'd personally like to see the daily wire family um i'm not sure i think it's very it's daily wire plus is a new venture it is just fully expanding the daily wire model so that we are not just you know right wing news but we are like it is solidifying us in the culture war we are doing entertainment we are doing education we are doing entertainment we have youtube streamers like all of that stuff uh so i'm not sure where we're gonna go next with it um i don't really have anybody specific that i would you know like i think this person should you know come over but jordan is just fantastic um it was literally surreal because he was in two weeks ago and he was doing a photo shoot and one of our um execs i was doing another shoot somewhere else she was like hey like you come on in like jordan's been talking about you and like wants to meet you and i was like me i was like this is it's just absolutely wild i feel like i have imposter syndrome i don't even know why i'm here it's crazy but i was very excited to meet him finally and it's just he's doing great and i mean as he always does but his new videos are absolutely killer and i think everybody's just having a really good time with it all right um let's see nachos and cheese i don't know who will be nachos and who will be cheese i'm out of touch with that i don't know what that means but i do love nachos let's see okay um oh where's this hello i messed up and i scrolled too fast did it do one minute um livestream idea you read anti-racist baby to us like we're a bunch of kindergartens and we all pledge allegiance to a photo of cca that actually would be fun to read some of the awful like woke children's books if you need any more indication the kids are being indoctrinated we could do that um enemy skincare doing bits for you goddamn i will like literally i i'm not just sponsored by nimmy and i don't just promote their products because they send me things like i truly all i have been wearing and this is kind of crazy i have been wearing makeup for work since i was eight years old because i was an actor my first professional job was when i was eight i believe and i have been wearing like heavy stage makeup for that for dance i started going to an esthetician when i was you know 12 or so because in hollywood and with acting that's kind of what you do so my skin has literally been through the wringer it is already very sensitive and here with this job i do wear makeup every day and it just wears and tears at your skin i've literally always had problems with some products that i'm using whatever even some of my estheticians would recommend i would have weird reactions literally never had anything with nimmy i don't know what kind of magic they put in their products they are all american and like i say in my ads they source their stuff from local farms i don't know what it is but it works so i'm not just saying that and i don't use it like i literally use them day and night so if you like the glow go buy some mimi skincare all right that's all um let's see even with push back on nuanced points just continue to set that tone we should never cater to the closed minded keep it up absolutely agree walker um and that's what i hope to do here um and so if i ever am seeming close-minded or black and white call me out always because i want to make sure that this is a place where people can actually share their experiences and not feel like they have to be fit into some political box we're just about common sense here we're about staying away from crazy people we're about being based and having a good time telling people to go kick rocks um let's see off topic but if you like horse content and traditional wisdom you should check out the dry creek wrangler school they're amazing people in their wrangler school is definitely worth it i will check that out i'm going to write that down will you actually write that down for me um dry creek wrangler school um let's see okay um you should react to the system by tom mcdonald if you haven't listened to it yet uh i have not listened to that yet but i will look it up um let's see somebody says no purposeflower says hey brad i recently started leaning more republican after i left tick tock and go of it happened i'm really grateful to have learned about your channel because all of your takes are amazing thank you so much really appreciate it that's funny that you said after you left tick tock because if you are on the wrong side of tick tock it's like a scary scary place i think you know code was freaking awful and i i we really have a lot of irreversible damage that our government did governments not covet the government's response to covet um but in a lot of ways it was the wake-up call that so many people needed and i'm not saying like a wake-up call to like come to the right or whatever but the wake-up call that this kind of government authority and the things that they were doing to kids to like shutting down our economy that it's not right and that it's not what our you know nation was founded upon not upon those ideals at all and so i do think that it was kind of like a shock to the system for a lot of people and so in a way trying to find the positive in everything you know finding a lesson in something my mom always says but the good thing is it's kind of her tagline um that you know no matter what's going on in life she can always turn something around and go but the good thing is and so but the good thing is i think hovid did have a way the government's response to covid had a way of you know waking people up to how the government was acting and how dangerous that is so um let's see have you ever been to michigan or know about the politics of michigan like our governor and stuff i do know about your governor she is a interesting interesting woman uh hot mess but i've never been to michigan but i know that there's a lot of if i'm not mistaken i know that there are a lot of parts of michigan that are red but she's a dem and i remember during covid all of her like hypocrisy of like shutting down the state but then she was going to florida all of that stuff i haven't heard anything about michigan recently so let me know if there's anything i need to be aware of james crawford hello again uh can you tell kyle to bring out cuffed uh to come out to the uk so kyle kashuv's one of my uh very good friends you guys probably know him as the classic you know poster on uh twitter he's great uh he worked with trump but yes he has a new dating app it is called cuffed if you guys are in the united states i'm very sorry yeah it is not in other countries yet but if you would like to be on cuffed i think it's super it's just a fantastic model they are trying to uh create a wholesome dating app their tagline is like grandma approved and you are only given one match per day and you have to talk to only that person so you can't be swiping around like talking to like six different people on like on the day you have to talk to that one person so as a result it kind of takes the game out of dating apps takes the game out of you know just swiping on tinder and swiping on hinge bumble that kind of thing um so it really makes it it's intentional about like finding a partner finding somebody with shared values if you guys want to be on it go check it out i've posted about it before i should do a highlight on my instagram for it because i absolutely believe in it kyle and his team are fantastic truly he's crushing it and the dating world out there is wild i can tell you that and i'm sure if you are young especially you know and dating apps suck so if you would like to but it's interesting i say that they suck but then i was with dennis prager and i reminded him of this conversation last week when he was here for backstage when i was on his show back in the fall or like last fall um he had told me he was like right you need to be on dating apps because that's the only way that you're going to find a conservative guy if you're living in you know a blue area so he's actually some of the more traditional folks are in favor of them because it gives you the opportunity to really like cut through the mess of like you can look at somebody's profile and go okay they are this religion they're this they're whatever they're you know open about being this whatever so i think if you use them correctly they can be positive and like sheller or we always say he met his wife on hinge so it works but um did you meet your wife i met her on tinder no way guys bobby met his wife on tinder see look at that both of my producers so dating apps aren't all that bad but this is a very cool new way especially in this world where i do feel like ddfs have become a game in many ways if you're not using them intentionally so if you want to check out kuft go check it out um no it did not match with dennis prager i was on his show and we were talking about dating um okay let's see so everybody go check out kuft that's all i'm saying um here's what i say to musk please get behind trump get over your environmentalism i know it's important you need to realize nothing can be done um yep that's a hot take um i honestly i don't say i wouldn't say like get over his environmentalism because i do like the fact that the work that he does is not from the government if you want to create environmentally friendly things if you want to work on evs whatever that's great and i think that those technological advances are fantastic and they'll be great in the long run for you know the earth for our planet i just don't want the government making these decisions i don't want the green new deal i don't want to spending billions of dollars we know that the government is incompetent never does anything correctly um so i would rather be in the hands of elon than it be in the hands of the government um and you know if he doesn't like trump i mean that's fine there's so many republicans that you know don't like trump that's still you know voted for him so i think it's also a pretty nuanced issue um let's see oh somebody said yes also read woke book kids or woke kids books for us i should that would actually be fun brett story time um thank you so much ryan i really appreciate it thank you for the super chat um even if you don't know how to ride a bike yet i bet you're already better than biden that's true although when i was in yosemite and my mom was telling me to ride the bike um i was getting comfortable again writing in a straight line and she said pick up your hands do no hands and my like 60 year old mother is like riding in front of me like woohoo and so i do it and i like crashed and scraped my knee and she kept writing she was like ahead of me and i was like mother like stop and turn around i scraped my knee i felt like i was four years old anyway love you mom i don't know if you're watching this stream guys my mom probably isn't watching the stream right now because you all know she has a farm um one of our cows is giving birth sometime in these like 24 hours possibly happening tonight i don't know when i haven't talked to her about it today but we have two jersey cows um flossie and millie millie is giving birth today most likely so it's very exciting you guys can take bets on what the name of the of the baby cow is going to be it's very exciting so that's probably what my mom is doing she's probably not watching the stream right now which is fine because she has other babies to attend to um i do think it's funny though because like my brothers and i all moved out she was an empty nester and so instead she literally adopted like 30 animals and has baby chicks baby lambs baby cows donkeys pigs she was trying she texted me the other day a craigslist ad of like a girl donkey and she was like do you think benji needs a girlfriend i was like oh my god i do call her like the female reincarnation of noah because her farm is kind of like the ark she just has little animals and pears alrighty um let's see thank you so much andrew i appreciate it let's see um can we get a segment of brett's reaction to videos of cop interactions officer brett's auditor code blue brett brett and blue dealer's choice thank you for throwing peanuts at me no problem young biscuit um that actually would be super cool because i have i'm not like the uh i um see like the whole cops have is such like a difficult issue i think because i think it is not as black and white as people on the left and the right would like to say i have you know cops in my you know personal life so many of like our my security and our security that kind of stuff are former law enforcement officers and they are incredible incredible people but i do think that the system is very messed up but i don't think it comes from them i think it comes from government and like these really ridiculous laws that they're asked to enforce and that kind of thing and the quotas that they have to reach so it's just a very complicated issue but that would be very fun because there are like hysterical cop interactions i would prefer to do those than the really aggressive ones because that would just make me depressed we do um we do have a bunch of cop videos that always go up on our facebook pages uh so if you want to watch those if you want to get good cop content you can go check them out there let's see okay uh if you want to play dungeons and dragons you should play the board game munchkin it's a dungeons and dragons for dummies never played d either okay i can do that munchkins munchkin okay i can do that a munchkin is dungeon i think it's maybe it's just called munch munchkin sorry i feel like i'm just repeating things um okay uh did you hear what happened to the bodega owner yes i did the one that actually i'm not sure i haven't looked at anything today but the one he was attacked um stabbed his assailant and then was charged for it even though it was self-defense so i'm not really sure where that story is going but i'll check up on that see who it's 1 million subs first you were nulls probably knows noel's this closer but we are getting there we are almost to 800 000 again which is insane we've had this channel for four months i feel like we'll probably hit a million maybe like maybe by like the six month mark i have no idea but if we want to make that happen keep sharing this with your friends we'll boost the algorithm whatever but knowles is a lot closer than i am so i i feel like there's no way that he's not gonna beat me um and we had another channel that's also about to hit emilia was it candace's she's pretty close oh yeah candace is personal um is also about to hit a million let's see you should uh have a segment on your show where you raced your biden on bicycles that would be good all right let's see segue to your ads are now rivaling knowles let's see we'd love to see you have youtubers like what's her face oh i love what's her face that would be fantastic um yeah those are fantastic people name the baby nancy pelosi or aoc no we're not naming our cow after those women gross no um check out the video that ron sanders just posted instagram the music absolutely makes it gold i will check it out when i get off the stream um tick doc has some hilarious low-key conservatives one of my favorite talks about cultural differences getting citizenship and that stuff uh you laney under slash under under slash underscore i'll take a picture of that and look them up my wife keeps calling me chugi what is that why she calling me that all right this is gonna be our last one today from spartan and then i want to close it out because i need to go talk up to bobby and some of our other people about what we're going to call this new content and come up with some ideas that are not just humiliating me on a bicycle they're all probably going to be humiliating me but it'll be a good time i know we're going to call it anyway okay um my wife is calling me chugi chugi means it's supposed to be like the elder millennial thing like not cool but trying to be cool i really i'm bad at describing it but it's used in the like oh that's so chewy in my mind when i think of chugi it's like in the mid 2010s when all the girls were drinking pumpkin spice latte and had uggs and like the huge infinity scarves and we're taking like those instagram photos that's very chewy so if you like kept doing that i think that is what chugi is supposed to be um but even though i am gen z i have to admit that i do use urban dictionary more than i would like to admit because sometimes the whole language moves so fast listen between gen z creating new words every day and the left creating new words every day definitions are changing at every moment and so i have to stay up to date on it so i literally a friend of mine texted me something and i was like this is really embarrassing but i need to look up that one anyway guys that is all for the stream today thanks for hanging out with me i had other things i was going to talk about but we ended up just like doing a q a which is honestly great okay cooper out of the coop somebody said new segments um cooper out of the coop that's actually funny i like the chicken coop um brett's last call that's actually kind of funny um let's see breader days i'm going back over to the normal chat to say see horsing around with bread cooper okay that's cool um and jacob last super chat says i think by needs handlers at least as good as your tv coach dad that's steven moyer he's fantastic but yeah that is that's true he needs better handlers all right guys oh my goodness i just pulled this anyway that is all for the stream today thank you so much for being here we're gonna do another one tomorrow i'm gonna be back on my schedule doing two a week but i am going out of town thursday and friday so we do have to do them back to back i'm actually going to visit one of my brothers which i'm so excited about because i've not seen him since christmas so it's gonna be great i'm gonna be with him so i'm gonna uh pre-record some stuff and i'll do my live stream tomorrow instead so i'll be back i'll figure out something fun to do or maybe we'll just hang out again uh but anyway thank you per usual for being here i loved doing this uh love hanging out with you guys so i will see you tomorrow if you come join all right bye guys you", "YkxGH0xxW9o": "what is up everybody hello welcome to the weekly friday comment section live hope you guys are all doing well it's been a hell of a week to say the very least how are we all doing um so obviously the supreme court had its last uh opinion day of their session um i think i'm a picture of the picture right now i eat it okay sorry i'm so delayed on this anyway uh the supreme court um again like i said last day of their session they released their opinion on a few different cases but obviously the one that has gotten the most media attention uh was the dobbs ruling it came from a case in mississippi and they have ruled that abortion should be sent back to the states that there is no right to abortion in the constitution uh therefore overturning roe v wade and casey so it has been a huge day literally people on all sides of the political aisle are just absolutely losing their mind uh so it's been just wild somebody says cope and see baby killers hey nitrogen fume how are you yeah it has been i mean obviously we all knew that there was going to be a meltdown from pro-abortion people instantaneously and i do feel like the majority of americans now the left likes to parrot this term that it's like 83 percent of americans are pro-choice or something like this but when you talk to most people they don't believe that you should be able to you know abort a child up to nine months they don't think that we should have you know free abortion on demand any time post birth abortions which are yes an actual thing that people are trying to do california has discussed it before um most people who the left lumps into that 83 do believe that there is some moral wrong there um but just don't really want to ruffle any feathers you know think of the cases of rape and incest that sort of thing but they are willing to admit that there is you know that it is not morally right in a sense uh so the left tries to you know parrot that around so it's just been a lot of very inflamed and passionate opinions online today i don't know if you guys have spent any time online today especially on twitter um it has been a bit much i have been waiting for this though since the opinion was leaked which is still mind-boggling that it was um that if you guys seen well you have seen it if you've been watching my videos that group rise up for abortion they wear all green they're the ones that have been going around pretending like they're free blading i don't want to know whether they're actually free bleeding or whether it's paint but they wear like the white either whitey tighties or underwear and they paint blood on it so it looks like they're free bleeding or like they've had some kind of like a miscarriage god forbid i don't know just it's horrific and then they take off their shirts they go topless and they have like hand prints on their boobs basically and they're waving signs and that sort of thing they have been at the forefront of all of this they were at scotus yesterday they were the supreme court this morning they are starting all of this um they're not part of jane's revenge jane's revenge we're just really getting into all of it right away change revenge jane's revenge i think that they're basically domestic terrorists at this point they are the ones that have firebombed over 40 pregnancy centers and they are the ones that are promoting this night of rage now pro-abortion people have been saying like a summer of rage if roe gets overturned but jane's revenge the organization has been putting up posters saying a night of rage if like dobbs didn't go in their favor so i'm just as a psa before we get into like laughing at some of these people please stay safe if you don't have you live in a very big metropolitan city in the united states there's no reason to go out where they might be rioting tonight just let them lose their minds and stay safe because i don't know if it's going to happen tonight or something else but it's hot i just saw somebody say sounds like a cult yes it does they argue or they claim that we are the ones you know putting them in their little handmaid's tale dresses and that sort of thing but they seem more cultish than anything that we do let's see um crisis king life wins great to see you braden um this has been a huge win for conservatives hopefully we can keep this momentum going into midterms i agree it does feel like there is just a big cultural shift so yesterday the supreme court struck down new york's ban on concealed carrying saying that it was unconstitutional and then today obviously rose overturned the consistent thing that i'm seeing is that the court is going back and looking at a lot of these old decisions and laws that have been placed have been in place for a long time in the case of this new york concealed carry law that has been in place for almost a century roe v wade has been in place for 50 years so they're going back and revisiting a lot of this and saying this was not the you know the framework that this was argued or how this was legislated was not really you know in line with the constitution so they're kind of backtracking a bit and saying let's get back to text and history literally in the opinion for the 2a ruling they said when it comes that the second amendment the only thing we're going to get rid of the the two interest um they had this thing where they were when they would go over 2a cases they had a two an interest um way of evaluating it so it was not just the constitution but they would have some other layered factor uh clarence thomas said no the only thing we need to look at is the constitution and our country's history and so basically the same thing happened today with roe um where they said they went back and they looked at how roe versus wade had been argued you know in they kind of like fit abortion into the 14th amendment and even ruth bader ginsburg i did an interview with a lawyer earlier today even with how pro-choice ruth vader ginsburg was she even had concerns with how abortion was fit into the constitution and so there's a lot of people that just cracks me up because the left parrots her as you know the queen of abortion basically in women's rights she didn't even really think that the way that it was you know fit in and decided was totally constitutional uh so all this to say it does feel like there is a cultural shift back to freedom back to the constitution getting back to you know the true texts and the values that our country was founded upon states rights being able to protect yourself not killing babies so i don't know what this means for midterms elon is predicting a red wave so it is a big win um let's see no name says one important thing about the overturning of rovi wade is that now an entirely new generation can get three months free from expressvpn with code ben exactly listen we're just making sure that our population does not decline so that everybody can get access to our fantastic daily work subscribers sponsors let's see james hey james how are you hey brett uh we in the recent news of rights in america i'm not advocating for americans to invade us in the uk but let's say i won't be shouting the americans are coming when i see you guys are near i love it yeah it was okay speaking of europe i'm not exactly sure what your abortion laws are in the uk or gun laws and that kind of thing but it does crack me up how people here especially women like the very woke you know feminist women they look to europe and they say oh my goodness like look at all their socialized health care and oh their abortion rights whatever like in france in a lot of those you know european countries they have more strict you know restrictions on abortion than we do and that we have had federally so i don't really know what they're talking about they're creating some you know magical european landscape in their mind uh to fit into their narrative but that has always cracked me up somebody said what is your favorite brett outro do i have specific outros that i do i always feel it i always feel like i leave my shows with like a well i'm doing great or this is what's gonna happen next oh you're jumping in you sometimes you say be vigilant oh yeah i do like that word i love the word vigilant yeah that's one of them but it is true that is like a people should be more vigilant these days if you don't open up your eyes and look around and notice what's going on and stand up and do something about it i get that there are some people that are in situations where they feel like you know they cannot lose a job or they can't do whatever but if you are in a position where you can speak up and advocate for your values why would you not do that so yes open your eyes and be vigilant but also gain the courage be brave do something stand up speak out um here we go as an nc as an ooh as an n i see you nurse uh a nicu nurse i am so happy about this ruling wtf is the point of my whole profession if babies aren't people love yes that is incredible mackenzie i am very happy for you um that's an incredible point this actually reminds me i'm going to come back to these super chats in a moment because there's more of them that i want to do if people are going constant vigilance yes exactly that's me should be a new tackling i can put that on a shirt as well with copenhagen kick rocks okay so i have this article that jackfasobia he just posted the headline of and i thought this can't actually be what i'm seeing this has got to just be a click bait whatever no it's not abortion involves killing and that's okay again i thought oh this is this is so funny uh no it is not this woman is literally batshit crazy um this woman talks about how uh let's see where we go where is she where did she get into the good stuff um oh yeah never in my life if i felt more pro-choice than when i was pregnant that's profound there we go um where is this part oh here we go this is where she compares abortions to self-defense we humans do kill when necessary victims of assault sometimes kill and self-defense targets of persecution sometimes kill for justice or to just reduce the number of their persecutors and the colonized sometimes kill for liberation mothers living in unspeakable conditions have been documented to kill their children as acts of mercy they are these are instances of necessary violence when it comes to abortion it seems possible that the conditions that necessate them uh may never be wholly eliminated even if vasectomies become generalized and perfect ectogenetic technologies become universally accessible as long as people are performing pregnancy on this earth performing pregnancy the hell is that uh as long as people are performing pregnancy on this earth they must be free to change their minds about seeing it through what performing and seeing it through this is not some like wave a magic wand maybe i'll try this and maybe i won't no pregnancy is a direct consequence of your actions whether you like it or not that is literally what changed my mind because i used to be pro-choice and as you guys know i'm not like the most religious person this was never you know from like a religious point of view i was more pro-choice just because i didn't think that i wanted the government involved in my body and like kind of ambivalently said like oh why why should i be controlled and i never i always thought that it was morally wrong and i would never do it but it just felt like government overreach until i realized that i was basically excusing people's irresponsible behavior and the way that you were excusing that was killing somebody who you know had no say in the matter you know did not engage in that behavior was a product of it but like why why should a child uh have to be killed to excuse your behavior because you refused to have any personal responsibility so that is personally what changed my mind on abortion um anyway back to this the adoption industry could be revolutionized and child welfare lavishly subsidized regardless of the available support no one should be pregnant involuntarily that's literally not possible unless we go to a like completely celibate society unless you are you know trying actively to get pregnant which honestly probably wouldn't be a terrible thing but i'm not totally advocating for it but you know what moving more in that direction from our hyper-sexualized like hook-up culture world might not be the worst thing in the world uh you don't have like a right to not be pregnant if you are having sex that's as simple as it gets um oh here we go the science of medicine dictates that when foreign organisms inhabit the human body unwelcomely we tend to eject them it's not you're saying that a baby is a foreign organism my god it is a mark of moral seriousness to acknowledge um what it is that we're doing when we butcher a cow put a pet to sleep or for that matter euthanize a human relative according to the philosopher of science donna haraway we must stay with the trouble of the violence we inevitably meet in our everyday traffic with forms of life be it at the dinner table battlefield or in the scientific laboratory rather than squaring our efforts of killing away to a moral callous or pretending that we aren't really killing multi-species feminists should subscribe suggest hairaway to the ethical imperative thou shall not make killable what the actual hell she is so like a few years ago this is just insane a few this just whole like abortion argument has changed dramatically just in the past five years i feel like maybe 10. it started off like i remember my mom used to be pro-choice because the pro the pro-choice argument was safe legal and rare and only in you know medical emergencies rape and incest that sort of thing it was not used for convenience it was not used for um as a form of birth control that kind of thing we then shifted this argument to well like when does life begin when can a child you know live outside of the womb that sort of thing um is it actually killing is it when is like how is person dictated i remember one of the first things that i ever saw ben shapiro do is he had this amazing debate um and that that line where he says um or the girl asks him like how well how do you know that the boy scouts can't have girls in them and he goes like oh it's in the name boy scouts but they dive into the whole abortion thing but my favorite thing in that whole debate is him arguing about personhood and when a baby in the womb is a person and he like basically just burns out he goes fine do they come up do they become a person when they come out of the vaginal canal like does that does that you know create personhood but that has been the argument that we have been having and now we have literally shifted to people that are like aggressively passionately pro-abortion because they've been radicalized or whatever that are literally saying yes okay we get that it's a life we understand now let us argue that killing is okay because it's a foreign organism like truly i think it's important to see how the debate has shifted because it is no longer people that are just ambivalently you know pro-choice there are these people that are putting you know yay abortion on cakes like miley cyrus and that kind of thing and actively act like um advocating for it anyway that's all you go read this article if you want it's just a whole lot of it is the epitome of like hyper academia and how they are able to argue their way in circles should be it should terrify you this is what happens in like higher education universities we have these like intellectuals that want to make some far-fetched claim and figure out a way to argue you can argue your way into anything really it doesn't mean that it's right doesn't mean that it's morally right but they find a way to argue it make these wild claims and then she will go this was a professor go present this to an impressionable class of 18 year olds and suddenly we have our cultural trends coming out of higher education anyway so you can go take a look at that if you would like it is called uh again abortion involves killing and that's okay but that's all i'm gonna go see what you guys have to say about this um watching uh the left mauled cope and sea all in the same breath has been a new level of catharsis that i never knew i could experience honestly yeah the last 24 hours personally i know that it's not good to gloat you know i don't know that i know that that's probably not healthy long term but it has been pleasant jack was so big has just been tweeting like let the salt flow um anyway i'd say i've uh given uh the benefit of the doubt for genuine tragedies but i've known people that have like five plus abortions can't learn what's wrong without consequences yes absolutely i one of the things that really changed my mind and made me again realize that pro-choice had really shifted to pro-abortion uh especially in my generation was when i was in a sorority and there were girls that you know were having sex but refused to go on birth control and had had multiple abortions it was like if you are in you know engaging in unprotected sex if you are in that hook-up culture you're not taking the necessary steps to be responsible and then you're just killing babies as you're former birth control and then complaining that you're depressed and have anxiety like can we take a look at the psychological ramifications of abortion i think we talk about that enough that is one thing that i am very impressed with and i think it's in the norwegian countries um they have some restrictions on abortion i think they are technically still legal like up to a certain point but one thing that they do very well i don't think we do well in america is that the people who are performing abortions the doctors they have to walk women through not just like hey this is what's gonna happen you have to sign a consent form but they talk about your options the pregnancy centers they talk about the psychological the mental health ramifications of it the suicide rates what will happen to your body just as if you know a lot of people argue against that because it's they think it's intimidation but when you're getting any surgery if you're getting any major medical procedure you must go through all of the you know the possible outcomes what could go wrong your chances of survival that sort of thing why don't we do that with abortion um and it has you know dramatically changed the culture and the conversation around abortion in those countries and i think that is a very healthy thing to um adopt here which i think would be great um anyway let's see uh somebody says roe v wade more like bros b played i also liked uh hoes v wade i thought that was good i was seeing of that around a lot there was a bunch of things that were like hoes be mad because roe v wade got overturned dylan says good thing we have the uh 2a because riot season is starting yes exactly summer of rage guys you know they called the blm riots the summer of love i don't want to know what the summer of rage is if that was love i i don't want to know i'm staying inside probably should anyway because i'm pale and i get sunburned so i shouldn't be outside in this weather anyway but this is just giving me more uh more reason to stay inside um oh my goodness let's see since you talked about nationalized healthcare let me inform you that healthcare in greece is an absolute on the shambles i wouldn't trust a public hospital to treat a case of mono let alone abortion i mean that is it's something that's not really talked about the people on you know center right or you know who are not you know for socialized or you know nationwide healthcare we talk about it but like when you think of i didn't know that about greece but that makes sense but like in canada i was talking with lauren chen about this the last time that she was in the office it takes months to get seen for something minuscule and it's kind of scary because that's happening in america too even for like a dentist appointment if i was trying to get like all my doctors and things set up when i you know moved to nashville getting set up with any doctors or dentists you're having to schedule things six seven months in advance my new primary care physician he's a good friend of mine a family friend and you know he was saying oh i could get you in like this week or something if you need if you have like a reason to come in but otherwise i'm gonna have to book you out like in the fall or that side sort of thing same kind of thing with any specialized um health things i usually see a cardiologist for like heart issues in my family and i don't even wanna i haven't started trying to find one here and it's just exhausting me even thinking about it because our health care system is just becoming more and more broken by the day but we are we are already seeing that in places with socialized healthcare so anyway but yes i totally believe that let's see working in ed tech i'm amazed at how many people in education are pro-choice how could he be in favor of killing the kids you could teach one day i know that again it's the same thing with like doctors or in that article where it was like somebody who i've never been more pro-choice than when i was pregnant like i don't i don't get it i cannot i think that i am somebody that has a fair amount of empathy and i think i'm pretty good at being able to you know like walk a mile in somebody else's shoes but it's one of those things where i do i cannot wrap my head around that whatsoever um let's see what do you think about the lies being spread by the now viral jamilah jamil uh oh my god i hate her ugh she is one of the most have you seen her she's the one on um crap what was the kristen bell show uh where they were oh the good place she's in the good place she's the indian woman in the good place she's like the raging body positivity toxic feminist oh she's a hot mess jameel uh jamila jamal jamil i think uh i've not seen her insuppose let's look it up uh who's gonna pay for a list of everything that people use as an excuse for abortion pregnancy care worker um don't touch my screen over yet but i'm gonna look it up jamila hold hold on guys she's just oh i totally butchered that where is she jeremy oh jamila jamil my god here we go all right guys oh what is she doing all right here we go here she is guys what in god's name what in the world she does a lot of oh oh are you a furry okay anyway so she's a bit of a hot mess she's not intelligent uh she likes to put her body all over the internet uh under the guise of body positivity anyway here we go what is this okay that's something else oh my god roe v wade's gone my heart is completely broken what has happened to this country the past six years have been terrifying and somehow keeps getting worse these effing evil bastards know that this never ends abortion it only ends safe abortion yeah also doesn't actually end abortion like i said she is an idiot let's just get this like all straight up clear overturning roe v wade does not end abortion it literally just says there is not a constitutionally protected right to an abortion therefore it cannot be federally legislated also the amount of gaslighting that biden was doing during his address earlier he went up there and he like multiple times lost control of the teleprompter obviously or even surprised anymore but he got up there and went i'm i'm calling upon the department of health of human and health services is health and human or human health i always get them it's the hhs anyway what oh my god i sound like a fool right now me it's um health and human services um i'm calling upon them and congress to take the necessary legislative steps to protect the right to choose all of this health and human okay i was right um there there's nothing that they can do he is basically just trying to get brownie points with people and feeding into the lie that overturning roe v wade means that you you know are completely ending abortion and that now the federal government can do anything about it and protect them he's just trying to make himself look good also he kind of shot himself in the foot there because he said you know abortion is going to be on the ballot like make this you know your reason for voting it's the same thing as when they try to like make the trans issue on the ballot and like education that sort of thing that backfires with them because they are you know most of america is waking up and seeing that the left has gotten absolutely insane and so i'm fine with it because that means there is a greater you know likelihood of a red wave happening because the policies that they are choosing to focus on are batshit crazy um but it is you know in fact shooting themselves in the foot by the way there we go um pro-life but only saying abortion has to be decided state by state but gun laws are protected nationwide effing hundreds of mass shootings this year and it's only june okay well here's another thing i saw a lot of comparisons let's just let's dispel this myth as well while we are here there are a lot of people saying i can't believe that yesterday the supreme court said that um conceal carrying must be a federal uh federally decided issue that it is a constitutional right and that new york cannot have laws against it you know california also cannot have laws against it that sort of thing but then today oh my god they said that abortion is not protected literally there are two there are it's two completely different issues that cannot even be compared 2a is part of the constitution to keep and bear arms separate the get rid of the you know the well regard the well-regulated militia that is they're basically two sentences brought together by a comma but they are meaning two different things let's just focus on keep and bear arms literally in the constitution nowhere in the constitution is there anything that talks about abortion there there's a right to life though so the two just can't be compared anyway sorry i'm actually getting to the post you were talking about now finally i should go on a lot of rants this has been a day okay her caption can't even effing feed treat uh or shelter the people already here they don't even have enough baby formula in this cluster f american yeah well it's your president that you elected which is why you don't have a lot of baby formula and our overarching government uh with massive fda regulations that make it possible for any innovation and expansion in that industry and the supply chain issues so you kind of have to shoulder the blame on that jamila these having dinosaurs will be dead before they see the devastating impact on our society i don't know what devastating impact you're talking about you will literally make us go extinct like the dinosaurs if we continue abortion all right here we go who is going to pay for all of these unwanted babies who is giving out free health care to people forced to follow through on pregnancies who is going to uh better fund the adoption system who is going to pay for the food shelter and educations of these forced children that is just it's a disgusting way to talk about a child that you're a forced child that you are unwanted that it's a god-awful attitude to have uh or the therapy of the rape victims and children forced to carry pregnancies to term first of all no health care is free but there are more crisis pregnancy in pro-life centers in the united states than there are abortion centers number one those are out there i think that they should do a better job communicating their existence to people and what they offer because they are incredible um churches and crisis pregnancy centers do incredible work the adoption system i do think that we need to work on it and especially the foster care system but most pro-lifers agree with that we're not saying you know who cares screw the adoption system we're not going to do anything about it um it's just a hot mess anyway thank you for showing me that because she is a hot mess we should see what the comments say oh i'm so done with this country not the uh evangelicalist even i can never pronounce this word i can't pronounce anything even angelicalists i can't did i add an extra syllable i think so oh my god guys again today we're going to just talk about mine not being able to pronounce things evangelist oh my why did i not i was not able to say that i always apparently mispronounce accessibility accessibility editing the power of editing i know well no that was during the video that i did earlier and i kept saying the accessibility and they went they kept looking at my producer was looking at me going like brett what you're saying it wrong and i had no understanding of it um a good family friend of ours always texts me and says brad it's okay it's just because you read a lot and i was like well maybe i should work on speaking rather than just reading and he was like well you're a nerd i was like great thanks donnie i appreciate it um anyway okay that's all but it is funny that they say that because i literally the churches and the you know religious pregnancy centers they are doing that work so got you there anyway all right i know you guys have been sending things in i'll go back to this um all right let me go back up [Music] oh my goodness hello um i was surprised it wasn't uh five to four i know it was impressive that it was uh six to three today should be a new hollywood or holiday i did see online that they were saying that it should be june 24th like juneteenth that i have which is going to be june 24th just throw it back at them um as somebody who's adopted it's a great day could have been a border but my mom didn't do that i'm 23 and about to graduate god is great well i am very very happy that you are here still i've talked about this a bit i tweeted about it but um my father encouraged my mom to abort me when i got pregnant and i'm very very grateful obviously uh that she did not uh that was actually her dis that was her big transition into becoming pro-life that very personal experience and like i said she was kind of vividly pro-choice sort of like how i was uh but when she was truly faced with that decision she realized that morally that was nothing you know never anything that she could ever do and it forced her to do her you know research on you know the history of abortion the practice of abortion um so i am also very happy to be here and i'm glad that my mom uh did not abort me and obviously and you know my dad and i i think you guys sort of know has been in and out of my life but he has since obviously changed his mind about that and i'm grateful that he has and so we're working on that but anyway uh let's see abortion in the uk is the worst in europe taxpayer funded up to 24 weeks my god and no conditions ph ps thanks for the follow of course i know that was fun i saw you on twitter i was like oh james is always in the super chats i gotta give him a follow um brett what do you think of michael malus i don't know him personally i don't agree with all of his uh opinions but he is a friend of daily wire he was just in a video with michael knowles um i know he's a smart guy i am personally i think that anarcho-capitalism is interesting not really my cup of tea i think it's something that you know i enjoy learning about and kind of seeing as a you know form of utopia in a way i don't know if at this stage with how kind of ill our society is if it would ever be doable um but i think it's a fascinating approach and there's a lot of his economic policies um since he is a bit more right-leaning and libertarian in that world that i do agree with but antarctica capitalism not really my cup of tea be vigilant and stay free there we go that's a good line brett you need to give me a list of some of the movies and shows you've been on so i can check them out also you need to be in a daily live film sometime hey we might be working on it we'll see i would love to do that um yeah i'll have to do that i think it's on like my mdb you can go check that out but um it should all be online uh sex is a choice so you should accept the consequences exactly don't engage in it if you are not willing to accept the consequences of potentially being a parent simple as that um great stuff for unborn babies everywhere love your videos and your thoughts on homeschooling i want to do that when i have kids i love that thank you so much destiny i really appreciate it that truly is my uh my very favorite thing ever when i like i'm interacting with people on here and i somehow at least offer some insight into homeschooling or alleviate some you know nerves about it because i i absolutely love it and i'm very very grateful for the experience um hey brad i love your show i think you're my new favorite daily wire person i think i said that right thank you so much i really appreciate that that means a lot um let's see y'all all right we have another birthday in the chat uh griftech everybody say happy birthday birthday is tomorrow uh just so happy the road is overturned i'm actually catching your live stream what a great pre-birthday this is so exciting everybody uh say happy birthday in the chat let's make sure that uh you have a fantastic day before your birthday pre-birthday birthday eve that's the right word um let's see uh enough left is tears to power wash my driveway exactly yes and it's quite salty too we need some touch grass merch yes i do want that desperately um james are you telling me that sexy lead to pregnancy this is news to me in 2022. i know well guys have you seen um uh have you seen the ai babies it's really weird they their new ai babies they it's kind of like you know in i don't know what class was it sex said that a lot of schools they would give you like a robotic baby or whatever these are like robotic children they are a step further than that and it is supposed to help millennials that are worried about the climate crisis that don't really want to bring children into the world but do want to be parents i'm not i'm not i'm literally not even lying it is i believe you it is so they can have children without feeling the impending doom that they are ruining the environment um so anyway that's uh i guess you don't need to be pregnant to have uh your own non-biological biological baby let's see um let's see i don't know if this is just a texas thing but it is still business as usual um regardless of the ruling as long as you are pro pull out oh god oh i know i'll be interested to see what happens so some of the states have already with what are called trigger states which they already had restrictions and like possible bands in place if roe was ever overturned so they would immediately go into like a rolling you know snowball effect of outlawing abortion tennessee is one of those however i think that it was set up so that if raw was overturned they had 30 days to like shut down abortion clinics and rework everything um they're trying to move it up i think there's also a big protest that's happening in downtown in 10 minutes so i think there's going to be a lot of topless angry feminists i hope that i have some videos of them by monday because we're going to talk about this on monday we did um i did a video today on the 2a scotus rolling because there were some really fantastic terrible takes about that and there were already obviously some terrible takes about the um roe and the dobbs cases but i want to wait until i see if this like actually this night of rage happens and if there are some good protests because i feel like i was literally telling sheller that i thought that i could do like a 45 minute hour-long documentary with the content that comes out over this weekend i'm so excited about it if it's not good i might cry like if they don't if they don't lose their minds i'm gonna be so upset again maybe it's not healthy to gloat but i kind of want it say keep up the great work love your content thank you so much daniel i really appreciate it um these people make selfish emotional choices and then make up reasonable sounding excuses for that behavior after the fact don't fall for the bs exactly yes ben you hit the nail on the head um again and i this is another thing that i say a lot but i think that it is a point that should be driven home i will respect if we have different political opinions if you have whatever if you are principled but a lot of people on the left is a very common left leftist tactic they change their principles and their opinions based on convenience for them in their personal lives it is a very selfish way to go about things it is very emotionally driven and i say this as somebody that loves objectivism and thinks that ein rand's the virtue of selfishness is the you know the greatest self-help book of all times it really isn't but it's just kind of like boiling down her philosophy of objectivism uh and so i do think that there is a healthy need of selfishness because we must put you know you have to focus on the individual in order to be a good person to contribute to the you know to have what am i saying you need to focus on yourself and be able to be a good individual kind of like the jordan peterson clean your own room before you go out into the world before you become like an active productive member of society all that being said the left takes selfishness to an absolutely astronomical level they will completely change and alter their premises and their values depending on what works for them in that moment will get them the most you know sympathy political you know push whatever um so yes it is selfish emotional choices be responsible clean your room there we go speaking of jordan peterson exactly responsibility for your own life work on yourself first it is truly like the you know putting on your own oxygen mask on the plane and i'm not you know advocating for a like hyper individualized you hate your community kind of world anything like that but in order to be the best person for the people around you to be a strong you know productive member of society you have to take account of yourself first you have to make sure that you are mentally strong um that you are you know your house is clean that your life is in order because otherwise it's you're just basically being a fraud um i give benefit to of the doubt to very vulnerable women i.e teenagers and rape survivors but i do think that abortion should be a last result with what is happening now we should open up a discussion about safe sex practices and adequate sex ed in school i absolutely agree um and that's why there are you know people on the right that i do respect and admire but i think that they hit the you know the abortion conversation in the pro-life you know conversation a bit too hard without empathy and nuance because obviously this is a deeply emotional and personal issue and you know a lot of people like 97 percent just get abortions out of convenience and they use it as a form of birth control but there are people in there that are truly you know scared in a you know situation they don't want to you know accept the responsibility they don't want to deal with the consequences it's going to be uncomfortable whatever you do have to have empathy for those people and people who have had abortion should not be shamed and they should you know get love and you know care and everything um and so i do wish that our conversations and our communication about abortion included that a little more um and that also goes back to being able to better communicate the resources that are available to you know those you know victims of rape and incest and the teenagers and that kind of thing because i think they just don't know and that you know the way that our society operates right now and with the hold that the left and for abortion people have on social media and that sort of thing if you get pregnant abortion is kind of like oh well that's just what i do i'm whatever you don't know that there are other ways to go about it um and so anyway that's my kind of long-winded thing about it but i just wish that in general we had more empathy when approaching it because it is a very very sensitive subject that begs nuance and i think it only creates more divisiveness even though i you know am very you know strong on the fact that i think that abortion is morally wrong there is always going to be you know situations where i obviously have empathy for the choices people have made and that kind of thing um let's see i have a question it's been years since heather's was cancelled but i was wondering if the show was renewed would you reprise the role of brianna parker absolutely i love the people that we worked with there i don't know if they would ever have me back considering what i do now because i've been exiled from a lot of things but um no i loved working on the show it was canceled for political reasons sadly because we were too anti-woke and a bit too insensitive but it was a great script and a great group of people working uh that i got to work with um let's see technically i am pro-choice but i hate how extreme the leftists can be on this issue yep exactly uh much more reasonable discussion happening here thanks brett i appreciate you being here bubbles um thank you so much i hope you're getting you know some good uh you know discussion whether it's on our community posts or somewhere i hope that you have a place where you can have these kinds of nuanced discussions um i have been seeing a lot more people you know in my life at least who are like i said maybe part of that 83 that are technically pro-choice but you know don't think that we need like post-birth abortions or you know on-demand free whatever um they really have gone insane so i'm glad you're here i'm glad you have some common sense uh i'm glad you feel like this is productive let's see now that roe v wade is overturned well we finally see matt walsh smile maybe i didn't i was watching ben's live stream today i sadly it was in a shoot so i didn't see matt's live stream because he did his show um live and streamed it on youtube and on instagram i believe um maybe he did smile i'm not sure let's see today i scheduled a dentist for monday where do you live how can you how i literally cannot get any appointments i had a consultation with a dentist in february that i think i booked in late december and then i was supposed to have a cleaning last week and then got booked for a shoot that i wasn't able to move around or they rescheduled me like during the time that i usually shoot comment section i was like i can't do it so i had to miss it so i'm gonna have to go back and reschedule that um let's see thomas says i am pro-choose not to have sex if you don't want to get pregnant also it is amazing to me that all these pro-abortionists themselves have been born yeah that's the classic ronald reagan quote is that it's funny to him that everybody who is anti-abortion has already um been born and is alive let's see i'm mostly right leaning and i agree with a lot of things in this channel this is not one of them but i hate how extremist people can be about that about it uh this seems like a general consensus again very glad that you're here that is one thing that literally is one of the coolest parts of this channel in this community that has very rapidly grown and formed is that there is a lot of ideological diversity and i think we're all kind of rooted in common sense and understanding that there's a lot of insanity happening around us and you know very extreme chaos uh and so i'm very glad that you can be hearing that you again like i said before feel like this is productive um we don't have to agree on everything it's a beauty of this country that i'm glad that you see that people are batshit uh let's see as a person of color we need to talk about uh margaret sanger and her racist history how can we chant blm and we are basically committing genocide on people of color exactly um yeah if you don't know the history of planned parenthood specifically it was created basically to help kill black babies when was it created it was um was it in 40s 50s something in that era um it's horrifying like it is chilling reading uh her writing and the reasoning behind planned parenthood and how they hoped that they could use abortion and they specifically put abortion clinics in mostly like minority communities um and you know i would hope that you know people that have advocated for pro-choice have moved past that but i think it is still very important to discuss that history especially because um the majority of uh i think i think it's overwhelmingly so that more abortions um it with black women uh than not and so it is something that i think is a crucial part of the conversation 1916. there we go so much earlier than i expected here we go hey datadev how are you yes again okay so classic shout out to datadev uh if you guys are watching go join the unofficial daily wire discord he always uh plugs that here there's an invite code daily wire if you guys wanna you know make friends with other daily wire fans um go check that out data dev is great um uh they are currently talking about the landmark supreme court decision in there so if you want to be able to have more of these discussions do that i would love for you to join too i need to redownload discord and then i might jump in there i think that'd be fun let's see um let's see i live in germany where we have socialized healthcare i had to get an mri most appointments were three or four months ahead yep that seems to be the trend um i'm naming my daughter abortia in honor of today i can't tell if you're being real or not but it's kind of pretty i like it um what a woman who wants a kid first finds out she's pregnant oh my god why didn't i move why did the thing move ah hello where did it go y'all you're moving so fast [Music] there we go back at it all right um when a woman who wants a kid first finds out she's pregnant these people will validate that child's existence but if you have a woman who gets pregnant wants to abort her baby it's suddenly not a life total hypocrisy yep exactly again there is just a lot of hypocrisy in the very uh passionate pro-abortion world sort of how uh one of the most blatant examples to me is that if you kill a pregnant woman it is a double homicide but then they turn around and they argue that an abortion is not a life or not an abortion is not a life but a fetus is not a person it's very uh again they shift their principles depending on the issue uh when somebody calls you on the phone do you ever answer welcome to the comment section i'm brad cooper i should maybe make that my ringtone not my ringtone my voicemail message um that might overwhelm people i think i say that in my sleep at this point just ask people to show you where the constitution says you can kill babies while the constitution was built around life liberty and the pursuit of happiness exactly 100 yes the reason why the 2a law was struck down uh and the right to life was upheld do you think that this election of states will flip to red like california new york oregon washington doubt that would ever happen um definitely don't think california new york oregon washington any of those but i do think that we could see a red wave in some of the swing states um and more so in like the local level of things we're seeing a huge red wave when it comes to school boards and city councils and that kind of thing um so there's small waves happening within the states i'll be interested to see if that actually you know flips our electoral map at all let's see one of my favorite stories to listen to is here the successful stories of unwanted kids kids were not of rape or to teen mothers how a person who wasn't even planned does something amazing exactly um i absolutely agree and that is one of my very favorite things about just children in general um and one of the most hopeful things is that you have no idea you know what this person has the potential to do and the great things that they could create in this world if you you know give them the right launching pad give them the right upbringing um and we desperately need more you know people that are you know geniuses and extraordinary and a lot of those people who were you know the unwanted or whatever are those people let's see um if only there were some products out there that a dude could wear or a woman could ingest it would prevent pregnancy to like 99.9 i know shocker and some that are so you know overwhelmingly accessible i said it right um also that brings up another thing with contraception that i wanted to touch on just in case it was brought up um in the dobbs decision clarence thomas wrote a section where he talked about a couple of three other um supreme court cases it was the uh case about same-sex marriage consensual same-sex sex and uh access to contraception and he said that those had also well you know the framework with which they were argued you know it could be revisited in the same way that row was revisited and overturned the left is freaking out about it but i think it is important to note i even went and chatted um and you know checked some of the commentary from a couple of my um friends that are gay and are also you know more on the you know center right or not being you know inflammatory or doing any of this alarmism whatever um they weren't worried about it because clarence thomas inserted that in no other judge backed it wanted to jump on that so while he might want to do that i don't really think that that is a huge issue also abortion is a very divisive and controversial issue that people are very heated about these days i don't think same-sex marriage or consensual same-sex sex or you know access to contraception those aren't really things that we spend a lot of time you know spilling ink over and talking about in the mainstream you know world especially with people that are more just you know in the center whatever uh so i don't think that that is anything to worry about but people will be signing the alarms about that so in case you've been seeing it that is the back story there clarence thomas was the only one who uh inserted that though so let's see um have you ever tried peruvian food big fan from the land of the llamas happy for the quartz decision i have had peruvian food i haven't had it in a while though because sadly and chella can attest to this nashville doesn't have great ethnic food no we have good we have good barbecue not as good as texas barbecue we have good fresh yeah i know texas barbecue's better i will say though chattanooga which is my hometown we have killer barbecue nashville i think i just haven't found the right one yet what we had at lunch today was actually pretty good it was fantastic um but anyway we don't have great ethnic food la though sheller and i both came from l.a absolutely killer food and i miss it every day so i did have i would go get peruvian food in l.a and i miss it but yes adrian says happy birthday to grifftec uh baby baby no justin bieber 2010. that's funny uh brett should call her fans the based af army love it um franz again is wishing griftech happy birthday he'll bring the beer in plan b uh let's see ever heard of db cooper or his more famous cousin sly cooper do you know who that is no idea i'll figure it out and i'll get back to you i saved june 24th in my calendar as a personal holiday it is a good day to be alive happy june 24th to you pal i appreciate that there you go love that this seems like a good opportunity to remind people that condoms are an affordable available and effective form of birth control hashtag rapid thank you nitrogen theme that is true there was a great tweet um and it said oh my god this is a terrible day for the left i can't believe they're now gonna have to spend 50 cents on a condom literally like sorry to bring a bunch of this is like not alive that i can you know not you know talk about sex and that sort of thing and here it really goes hand in hand with this conversation but it's true the audacity that they now have to you know take responsibility and take precautions if they are going to engage in something that has consequences uh no name says i like seeing without a shirt like any other guy but i'd pay to have these particular women to keep their shirts on he's talking about the rise up for abortion women oh my god wait i had a specific one that was worth showing hold on let's see where was it give me a second where is it i hope i can find it she was so scary looking she was so scary looking okay i don't know if i oh oh no never mind i had said it to a couple friends and then it went away so i don't really know um horrifying truly horrifying maybe worse than some of the people that i react to on the youtube shorts let's see uh oh um i am thoughts about the amazon alexa uh deceased voice thing oh my gosh did you see that that was creepy number one my family and i all got rid of our alexas a couple years ago do not absolutely do not trust that uh they don't even like siri sometimes siri just turns on for me at certain points i swear like the she's listening to me i'll have friends mention something they want to buy and suddenly i'm getting ads for it and i'm like why get that garbage off my phone anyway so the gist of the alexa thing is that alexa will be able to replicate the voice of somebody if you just share like one audio clip and they are designing it under the guise of saying that you could hear a deceased person's voice again by like sharing an audio clip and then you can hear their voice that feels like an emotional tactic to get people on board with this and then they're going to be like bringing us into some weird ai control they're all listening to us that sort of thing i don't know it weirds me out uh i never got my protrusion and think that protesting topless demand is a good tactic oh no don't get naked oh no this is why i think that they know they aren't appealing to men yeah exactly it was kind of like when all the topless ladies like jumped out and ran around like the wnba court it's like what are you doing you just want attention and there's nobody even here watching it and the wnba players who is it bad to say a bunch of them are lesbian i don't know they are but it's kind of the uh it's kind of the stereotype there they aren't the ones that you need to convince they don't have the abortion problem that you do let's see have you ever thought of inviting bill maher on your show i think that would be such an awesome show and discussion to watch i would love to i think i have a kind of imposter syndrome because i don't even know like if i'm big enough to invite people like him on the show or not like obviously within the daily wire network i sort of can but i think at some point i will be able to do that i'm still just kind of wrapped up in this world of like holy crap there's almost 700 000 of you guys here for respect expect let's see only reason i see the only reason i can possibly see abortion being approved is only for rape cases yep a lot of people have that opinion um let's see aaliyah says i'm 15 and trans any advice and then somebody else jumps in here and said uh leah talk to a professional first not somebody that will just tell you what you want to hear do your research before you do anything permanent good luck i second that absolutely because you know gender dysphoria is real with some people um and so again talk to somebody that you trust and that will not just blindly affirm and say yes you know just do whatever and also truly wait before you dive into if you you know have not already dive into any like you know puberty blockers or things that have irreversible damage just because you know doing that prior to adulthood it can be dangerous and if you've watched a woman what is a woman you know um but yes i'd say second that good luck and obviously i hope things turn out all right um but yeah i hope you have a good support system in place that you know can give you equally balanced advice and walk you through that so um but yeah jump in here anytime and we can chat let's see um i used to be uh big on pro-choice but several pregnancy scares later with a girlfriend and i agree that we should be more responsible with our actions totally agree that is a great uh uh character development there i always say character development but yeah i have heard a lot of stories of people you know saying similar things of you know they've gotten into that situation almost have you know made that decision and then realized okay this is not something i could ever do um let's see first time caller long time listener keep up the good work brett love the show thank you so much mez i really appreciate it um glad you are here let's see whether regardless of whether you are pro-choice or for life the constitution says nothing about abortion it should have always remained the purview of state legislators um totally agree it is basically as simple you know as you can make it regardless of you know like you said pro-choice or pro-life this is never something that should have been federally regulated because again not in the constitution it is very simple if you understand the process of government see somebody said also i would like to support the idea of you doing an interpretive dance instead of a tattoo when you hit one million my mother let there be rock my mother loves you for that she is saying thank you i agree i will do an interpretive dance you i will absolutely i will sign the life away i will i will do the interpretive dance but diane told me i can't get a tattoo so we're not getting a tattoo guys i'm very sorry to say that um hello from england hey james uh oh we have another uh other james james crawford we have another james from the uk in here you guys can be friends uh first i'm judging a live from you i'm glad rovi wade has been overturned it was against the constitution from the start happy to have you here um the right should welcome hindu americans who are rapidly moving to the right they dismantle leftist narrative people uh poc conservatives who love america happy to have you that is fantastic that you guys kind of remind me of um you know the hispanic community who has absolutely been taking you know advantage of by the left because they thought that they you know unequivocally had their vote regardless of anything and as the left gets crazier a lot of cultures that have immigrated here and immigrants who have more traditional uh you know values regardless of you know economic whatever are going oh my gosh these people are insane we would you know be more comfortable over here so anyway happy to have you love it um uh hey chuck thank you so much i really appreciate you being here as a white man in his 30s it can be hard to find good fact-based news sources keep up the good work you look great and yellow thank you so much i actually never used to wear yellow but i saw the shirt it was on sale so i got it um uh this overturning cannot bring back the million slain since the ruling i think it is important to remember this absolutely um i do think that we are going to look back at this period where there was such like a violent pro-abortion stance and again i don't mean just like the safe legal and rare you know ambivalent whatever but the people that have you know shifted our culture into being so aggressively pro-abortion i think we're going to look back at this you know in 50 i don't know how many years and go oh my god we were literally ill um let's see afro and casey all my homies hate row and casey um red keeper for president please no oh my god i say this a lot i would rather drag myself over hot coals than ever work in the federal government truly i really admire the people that can do it um it would never be for me though um okay this is funny does that forgot to calm down we aren't coming for their abortions we just want common sense abortion reform uh he's basically making a joke about the uh about gun control we don't want to take your guns we just want gun reform common sense gun reform and gun buyback and we will come knock on your door and take your guns from you um there we go if you are responsible adult this really shouldn't impact your life much use protection and don't sleep with anybody you don't want a future with exactly can only sympathize with rape and incest victims i'm in the same boat yes um mitchell says i just woke up i checked the news i smiled now i'm going back to bed i love that for you happy friday mitchell glad you popped in for a moment um there we go yep anastasia says so abortion is legal but if you kill a pregnant woman you are charged with a double homicide uh but i thought that it was just a couple of cells according to pro-choice arguments so why then is it homicide exactly again it is just a very distorted argument um [Music] let's see uh all earthly life is a clump of cells a single cell's the life form let's stop avoiding the important and difficult problems in life yeah i agreed let's see right leaning here same same-sex marriage stays upheld i honestly think that most people genuinely think that they don't have like a big problem with that i do and i saw a comment come in or that i want to get to where they were talking about just like the federal government being involved in marriage i don't really like maybe this is a hot take i'll see what you think shelter because you're married but the federal government being so involved in marriage kind of weirds me out especially without like kind of using it as a way to you know change tax codes and that sort of thing it's just a bit weird so i don't it's like i if you're gay that's fine totally you know you can get married whatever but it's like just on principle i don't think the federal government should be involved in it in the first place like yeah it's just weird yeah i'm with you i mean but they they'll use any avenue to basically control your life exactly so it's not if you know if same-sex marriage if that was you know brought into the courts it wouldn't be like i would be against it because i don't want gay people to get married it would just kind of be like why are we even talking about marriage again like even for you know straight people if you want to get married in the church that's one thing but like why do you have to do it legally it's just the whole system that has been set up is very weird i was talking with one of my gay friends about it and he was laughing and he was saying like why did people fight so hard for you know same-sex marriage the church you know people who are you know more christian they don't even want us to get married so like why are we trying to like force ourselves on them like i'm just gonna do me and it's fine we'll just be partners or whatever um and he's just wonderful he has a great attitude about it but it cracked me up uh but i think that there's a lot of you know a lot of people in the lgbtq community even have like very dissenting you know opinions about all of it so i don't think that it would ever you know come back to the supreme court because again i think most people are fine with it um but that would be interesting um let's see we're going to wrap up soon but i want to make sure that i get to some of these uh i'm now able to vote and i'm so happy to be a part of the hispanic red wave amazing hell yeah that's sick just discovered you yesterday and absolutely love what you're doing personally it's inspiring thank you so much audrey i really appreciate it i'm happy to have you here um i'm glad yeah if i can at least instill some confidence or you know excitement about some kind of common sense an array of you know common sense in this insane world uh that makes me very happy i hope that i encourage uh at least some of you to you know be brave and speak up and be confident in your values whatever they are and to not be afraid to you know dissent from a narrative i do think that we are seeing some kind of cultural shift with these two supreme court cases um with the you know red wave that is happening that is bubbling and i really don't mean like republican versus democrat but i you know people taking back control of their lives fighting for parental rights fighting for freedom and right now that is happening more on the center right um i wish it wasn't the case i wish we had something that was more equally balanced so we could get back to like a healthy debate as america was you know founded upon um but right now it really is like one side has gotten very very extreme and is excusing a lot of really gross behavior so anyway um no name says i am going to marry a doll like that one woman maybe our doll children can have play dates oh gosh yeah if you guys go watch that video if you haven't seen it already it's super weird um fonz says my newsfeed is full of liberals screeching with only narcissistic viewpoints i just sit back and laugh cleaning my firearms raising my kid and paying my taxes love it great attitude let's see i almost got in trouble at work for reading the news today but it was totally worth it life wins oh my gosh all right we are going to finish this off by looking at you guys all need to go look up crying at work on twitter this is what was happening on twitter today they are not okay listen to this crying in the bathroom at work because i am legitimately scared for all women at this point this one was my favorite because he's like clapping back at this i'm crying at work can't believe what's happening before our very eyes it's over for all you hoes lmao let's see nothing like crying at work because you no longer have rights over your own body what the actual f here we go i'm at we're crying right now this is absolutely effing terrifying what the f we need to do better than this how can old effing men whose penises are probably inverted at this point have so much power get them out oh my god today is not a crying in the bathroom at work day it is a crying at my desk because it's a their problem today somebody said whatever you do don't search crying at work no definitely did uh i cried in my apartment my friends are crying at working on the train we are not your political play things these

next week enjoy the segments that are coming out in a bit i believe anyway all right bye guys", "qiNItA_2dIk": "oh I think it's Crystal it's like playing out of a wine glass [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I am so sorry that I made you all watch that with literally no context or introduction but I wanted it to be jarring I wanted to really wake you guys up because I felt assaulted by that when I first watched it on Twitter and I wanted to make sure you got the same experience as me yeah yeah but we're going to talk about this video in the internet's reaction and all of the backstory before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection so lizzo is on tour right now she is providing her fourth album and she just had a stop in Washington DC and while she is there the Library of Congress reached out and invited her to tour their collection of musical instruments which includes former president James Madison's famous Crystal flute now this was never played it has been in the archives in the Library of Congress for over 200 years and it is preserved immaculately like guys if you want to be preserved like that you need to be using nimi skincare because that is the only thing that is going to protect your skin to that level I have been using nimi skincare since January and it has absolutely changed my life I'm not even joking I love their daily glow up routine and on top of their incredible effective products that are 100 American made they have amazing values and unlike a lot of people on the internet right now they actually respect this country and respect our heritage and our history which is shocking for a company these days so if you want to support them and try out their products go to nimiskincare.com use promo code Cooper at checkout for 15 off again that is nimiskincare.com promo code Cooper all right back to this other very well preserved artifact and we're not talking about my skin anymore thank you very much no that was so bad sorry guys had to do the plug and lizzo toured the collection for four hours she was apparently fascinated by all of it and loved it and then she was allowed to play the historic James Madison flute and then at her concert the Library of Congress Capital PD and Secret Service all work together so that she could have the flute on stage and play it for her fans which is the video that you guys just watched and obviously people are angry because every time lizzo does something that is even a little bit political it's usually awful terrible she really should just stay in her Lane because even though I hate to admit Candace and I both agreed on this she is very talented but they're not angry that the flute was played they are angry that we live in a time where people act like they have no respect for our history or any historical artifacts they are angry because it was played by somebody who hates our history she is vocalized that explicitly and who twerked while playing this historical artifact she also twerked before she went on stage obviously because it's lizzo this is this is made for President Madison and sent to him in 1813. I mean it often seems to me like that is just the way that her body naturally moves like she's not even trying it's just instinctual to start twerking but anyway just a few weeks ago lizzo literally said on stage that she was oppressed by our government so remember when you're voting for your favorite artist vote to change some of these laws that are oppressing us she has not demonstrated respect for our country and that was very evident in that video and in the video from her concert and people were very upset about it somebody said I don't have a problem with lizzo or any other famous musician playing the flute per se but using it as a prop during this degenerate display is rancid I agree with that another person said everyone involved with the decision to allow lizzo to twerk while playing James Madison's flute needs to be deported I don't care if their citizens support them somewhere that's powerful others obviously saw the same video and believed that it was empowering and not just because it's body positivity lizzo being half naked with a freaking flute but because she was a black woman playing something that belonged to a founding father now this woman who's a blue chick Tiffany C Lee she said lizzo a black female Superstar collaborating with Carla Hayden the first African-American and first woman librarian of Congress to use a flute from James Madison the founding father who originated the Three-Fifths Compromise and also the Library of Congress itself the symbolism another person said racism is so funny how are conservatives mad at lizzo for playing an old flute right now another one said white people freaking out over lizzo playing a slaver's flute is my favorite Twitter right now nobody's freaking out because she's black you guys are the ones that are bringing race into this per usual lizzo playing the flute that belongs to the  that passed the Three-Fifths Compromise is absolutely icon Behavior and the Twitter account vocal distance summed up this very strange dichotomy in a great thread that I highly recommend you all go read but I just have a clip from it they wrote so because we have no shared meaning with which to understand our different cultural situation and no one can agree on how to interpret our social and cultural situation how we interpret cultural moments like lizzo playing James Madison's flute is totally up for grabs there is not only a fight about how to interpret what lizzo did there was a fight over the legacy of James Madison the founding fathers the Constitution moral Norms social norms what counts as good music what lizzo's music means and the cultural significance of lizzo the significance of the flute how to treat historical artifacts how we interpret things generally who should decide and basically everything else there is no shared meaning at all when it comes to interpreting anything I'm absolutely right like our country is so fractured morally and socially that we cannot even agree on any shared values or respect for where we came from our history this is why even though you know I do believe in facts and logic you can't just use facts and logic to sway people anymore through a nice cordial conversation and a hearty debate over dinner with your left-wing friends because that would take them having the same premise as you which barely exists anymore I used to say we're all trying to get to the same place we just have different ideas about how to get there not anymore like there are people who want to take our country in a drastically different direction a Direction Where We have no respect for any history where kids are able to be trans to all of that stuff and it's very depressing but it is why I care so much about using humor and finding empathy and leading by example because those are the things that help change values I'm not trying to change your mind about a specific policy I mean maybe I can do that somehow but I do hope I can change some people's minds about what is moral and what is correct and so in the spirit of that I'm going to show you a video that you might not have seen that actually changed my opinion a little bit about this um because I really loved it [Music] [Applause] [Music] like it's beautiful she's incredibly talented foreign like yes lizzo dances half naked on stage and makes very very um incorrect political statements and is just very odd a lot of the time she is a classically trained flute player just watch that video she's incredible and that was respectful and I thoroughly enjoyed it if I had just seen this I wouldn't have really had a problem with it and many people agree it did not go viral it did not have click bait material she was actually wearing clothes which was very odd for a lot of people to see including myself somebody said I actually thought she couldn't even play the flute from watching the other video wow she does herself such a disservice to portray her talents like that she is very good I mean I could just go on a whole other tangent and we could have a different conversation about you know women sexualizing themselves and distracting from their talents and intellect but we won't do that today but just be thinking about that in regards to that comment another person said the most remarkable aspect of this video is realizing that lizzo owns pants yeah and pants that don't have the ass cut out of them I'm sorry if you're visualizing that photo like I am another person said beautiful who knew she was this talented I've only seen her half naked and twerking obviously you can see this person has our daily wire do not comply profile picture this is not some left-wing person this is somebody that probably agrees with me on a lot of things he was also going wow I literally had no idea because lover or hater you can't deny from this video this very basic boring not click-baity respectful video that she's talented and you know objectively that was a beautiful tribute on the flute I was glad to hear it it sounded lovely and I wish she had just left it at that that would have been so much more powerful and much more unifying guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "2MKTHlOq2mA": "Merry Christmas Merry Christmas what if I don't celebrate Christmas happy Holidays happy holidays it's okay to say Christmas you know go yourself finally some good service I mean that's funny but it's also sadly very realistic because she embodies how I feel on a daily basis when I watch these videos when I hear people like genuinely say things like that that Merry Christmas is problematic like get a grip go kick Rock somebody commented and said the local radio show I listened to said the best way to say it is just holidays as emotionless as possible as not to offend anyone that's just upsetting like at least say happy holidays with like a cheerful smile on your face I guess that would offend people that are like perpetually upset and like victimizing themselves", "nk4ArRUNbys": "that's nice what is that [Music] that actually looks fun not bad not that bad it's horrific that is disgusting you know I was on board until they started like submerging themselves in like quicksand type stuff I was talking with my brother about this recently I don't know why it came up but both of us grew up thinking that like quicksand was going to be a big deal in our lives we were really gonna have to be like worried about it apparently these guys have basically found it somebody commented and said don't you get stomach worms and weird infections from areas like that that are swampy do you think these guys care about that no they're having a good time they're not going to listen to you oh somebody said women would hate that this brings men so much joy I don't would I do it probably not but go ahead it's your life", "b8e6VpVynlg": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper so last week the swimming world governing body it's called fina banned most transgender female athletes from competing in all events including the olympics it is a huge deal and i say most transgender female athletes because the exception is that if you started transitioning under the age of 12 then you can compete because apparently then you still have less testosterone you didn't spend as much time going through puberty as a man i mean like i'll take it this feels like a move in the right direction but matt walsh did make a good point when he said that rules such as these might just encourage people to start transitioning kids younger so that they can be able to compete or do whatever and obviously we don't want that i would much rather you transition as a fully formed adult when you were able to make an informed decision you know it might have ramifications i don't know but i do like that they are moving in that direction and obviously this comes in the wake of the whole william leah thomas situation at penn just a few weeks ago leah said that he had olympic aspirations probably not gonna happen anymore but this whole debacle about transgender females in women's sports is not just isolated to swimming it is in every different competitive sport including skateboarding now before we get into this make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already and then ring that notification bell so that you never miss a comment section episode so last week a 29 year old transgender woman a la uh a man uh beat a 13 year old girl in a skateboarding competition what trans woman beats 13 year old girl in nyc's women's skateboarding contest this literally looks like a man wearing a wig because basically it is and then there's the little 13 year old girl i have so many questions about this entire thing because it feels like there's an age problem there's a gender problem this person does not look like he transitioned at 12 years old and you're going to find out he did not but immediately the comments were again a major white pill because people are really waking up to this issue because people are angry about this rightfully so somebody said just corrected that headline man beats 13 year old girl in nyc women's skateboarding contest yeah it's more accurate i mean guys she had no chance against a literal fully formed 29 year old man i mean maybe she would have had a chance if she was using bond charge products to optimize her life could have been helpful bond charge is a wellness brand that is founded on science but inspired by nature their products help you reduce inflammation regulate your circadian rhythm help you with eye strain which is why my very favorite product as you guys know is the classic blue light glasses and you don't have to worry about these being mass produced in asia they are created in australian optics labs

bondcharge.com and use code bond charge for 25 all of their inventory they are doing a company-wide sale right now so go check it out optimize your life and then maybe you too can win against a 29 year old ex-military transgender female could be great it did remind me of this scene from seinfeld i don't know if you guys have seen it here we go it's with cramer [Music] i'm so sorry but like even without like the child aspect this is the perfect video to sum up transgender women competing against women the playing field is so far from leveled this is a bit extreme it's a bit comical but the fact that we are actually living in a world where this happens outside of a sitcom kind of wild but you know what it's 2022. somebody else said please tell me that the trans woman was a b-list skateboarder or runner-up in an event before transitioning because there's no way this is a mere coincidence okay just wait the comment directly under this seriously the transgender skateboarder 29 who claimed first prize in a new york city women's competition this weekend defeating her 13 year old and 10 year old competitors is a divorced ex-navy father of three who was rejected from the women's olympic qualifiers last year it is the clown world am i alone in saying this is literally insane this is not some little strung out emo girl who decided to become a boy and is like gotham like you know skating with saggy jeans or whatever this is a a veteran a father at 29 years old it's like i'm gonna become a woman and dominate the children and the fact that the sports world allows it and goes this makes sense adult men should play against small females i'm not here to talk about my transition i'm here to kick some  ass we are so gung-ho on bending a knee and appeasing this tiny one percent that loses their mind about every injustice or sensitivity that we are blowing all reason and rationality out of the window none of it makes sense because everywhere else i look it's just chaos simply put somebody else said yes my competitive spirit always feels validated and rewarded i am full of pride whenever i win out over a 13 year old child totally get it i think gender and skateboarding is not as big of a determinant of skill and ability as with other sports now you guys jump in the comments and let me know what you think about this because that was kind of my first thought and then i think i had to correct myself obviously i think that it's a bit more extreme with something like swimming or gymnastics oh my god can you imagine a trans woman doing gymnastics oh my god or figure skating i can't do the lotus with a shattered ankle i'm just a man for god's sake i'm thinking about it with skateboarding especially when it is a child i don't skateboard but i snowboard and you're using your leg muscles you have to have incredible core strength and so i do think that there is some advantage but i think that this person might be a tad bit off base somebody else pointed out something that i was thinking about and that i kind of just mentioned and said isn't the bigger problem the age gap why is a 29 year old competing against teenagers yes someone else said it's a women's event many women peak at sports in their teens so the male competing at an older age than the average female is a fair comparison however framing it as a kid's competition isn't accurate a 17 or eight-year-old in peak physical shape like our you know olympic gymnasts simone biles is not the same thing as a 10 or 13 year old skateboarder at 10 and 13 your bodies are not in peak physical performance this person's trying to excuse this it's a fair comparison no an ex-navy 29 year old who is probably still at peak strength at that age even with the estrogen even with the hormones is exponentially stronger than a freaking 10 year old get it through your brain these people have all these blinders on they are so blinded by a progressive agenda they literally see no logic if you want to have a transgender skateboarding competition by all means have fun i want you to be able to skateboard and do what you love and you know be do your truth or whatever but that is not compatible with a female basically children skateboarding competition i don't care if they're the best kid skateboarders in the world it is not a fair competition none of it is fair also four of the six finalists were under the age of seventeen four of the six that's not peak physical teenage woman performance not cool not frank and cool apparently this is not the first time that this happened in the skateboarding world even though this is the first time that i'm hearing of this back in may 27 year old female skateboarder took to instagram to share her story about losing to trans women twice she got tons of hate it's actually a very cool story because tim poole who is one of my favorites and he is also a skateboarder paid her the difference in her like second place earnings versus what she would have made at the red bull competition in first place if she had not lost to a trans woman and obviously not the same as getting that first place trophy but i think that's dope that tim did that because obviously this is a huge huge issue and i really don't know the best way to combat this other than brave athletes like taylor you know standing up and speaking out or like some of leah thomas's you know teammates being willing to speak out one of them spoke in matt walsh's documentary what is a woman and being able to expose the truth of what it is like to compete against a biological man that feels like the most effective way to communicate this because it is anecdotal and it is emotionally driven and as we have seen you know facts and logic only get you so far with the extremely radical progressive left you have to lean into their you know communicative tactics which are emotions so i think that these women are doing a good job of doing that but i want you guys to let me know if i have any skateboard fanatics in this subscriber base in the people watching this video let me know what you think if there are any other examples of this or if it is even right for a 29 year old to be competing with a 13 year old like is that normal i have no idea please let me know i need some clarity on this hey hey i can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "2lOepSWfO3U": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper now I think you all obviously know this but California always leads the charge in degenerate behavior and terrible policies that actively are ruining the state every single day and we have another that just came down the pipeline today and this time it is coming from Good Old San Francisco itself because hell is no longer a place only accessible after death but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection and I suggest you do that because there might be some cool sales happening soon because of the time of year it is San Francisco has just announced their gift program now I love gifts I'm very excited about this I thought oh this is really interesting it is called the guaranteed income for transgender people program gift so here's their website it's a terrible terrible website it says gift will provide economically marginalized transgender people with unrestricted monthly income as a way to combat poverty our most impacted community members face because apparently California is not wasting enough taxpayer dollars my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined now I thought that this was some kind of hoax I could have totally believed that this was a Babylon B thing but no here is a real article about it from Fox it's a San Francisco launches guaranteed income program for transgender Community they have a little description here it's a pilot program and it is the first guaranteed income initiative to focus solely on trans people and will provide regular unconditional cash transfers to individuals or households who qualify according to the mayor's office now solely on trans people I thought that this whole you know side of the political aisle cared about equality like this does not sound very balanced to me whatsoever but you know it is balanced balance of nature now guys I try to live a healthy lifestyle I think I do a pretty good job I mean I work out I eat healthy foods but you know life still gets in the way which is why I love a balance of nature balance of nature fruits and veggies are the best way to make sure that you are getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day these products are 100 whole food and they use a cold vacuum process that preserves the natural phytonutrients and whole fruits and vegetables and encapsulates them for easy consumption balance of nature set a bunch of their products down to the studio for my team to try and I have loved incorporating them into my supplement routine I felt more energized and I was also really excited to find out that this product is certified kosher so maybe I'll have to send some down to Florida for bed now when you're disciplined enough to take care of your health you reap all kinds of benefits more energy less fatigue better focus and consuming the right balance of fruits and vegetables every day is an important First Step so go to balanceofnature.com and use promo code Cooper for 35 off of your first order as a preferred customer again that's balanceofnature.com a promo code Cooper for 35 off of your first preferred order I can guarantee you will feel more balanced and healthy which is good because none of these people are I think at all now before we move on I also want to talk about a point that they put in this article saying that this program will provide regular unconditional cash transfers now having unconditional cash transfers does nothing to promote these community members getting better there is no incentive for people to get back on their feet because they're just going to keep receiving this money for 18 months I think is how long the program is now I have personal experience with this I think I've talked about it a lot so you guys probably know by now I have a brother that suffers from severe mental health issues he was homeless for a while he has been on Social Security he has been part of these government subsidized programs and I've seen the mentality that he and a lot of other people on the streets have where they know that this money is just going to keep coming to them and they don't have to do anything in order to keep getting it and often actually they will go into meetings with these government social workers and they will pretend to be crazier than they really are they will pretend to be worse off than they really are because that means that they will get more money from the government and it never stops they just keep getting sent these checks the reality of what it does is just perpetrate this cycle of poverty and drug usage and unhealthy behaviors obviously I'm sure the people who created this program think that they are doing something that is you know so beneficial it's going to help so many people but you really have to look at the result of a government program rather than the intent because that is how you're going to see whether this will actually work and we have social security right now and we see that it is just a failing program so I don't know why they think that this is going to do anything better can I have some money now I digress but back to the information from the source itself this is on the gift website they say the transgender district and the lion Martin Community Health Services in partnership with the municipal City departments and the City and County of San Francisco will provide 55 transgender residents of San Francisco county with 1200 a month in guaranteed income for a year and a half the program will prioritize enrollment of transgender non-binary and gender non-conforming and intersex people who are black indigenous or people of color experiencing homelessness living with disabilities and chronic illnesses Youth and Elders monolingual Spanish speakers and those who are legally vulnerable such as TGI people who are undocumented engaging in survival sex trades or formally incarcerated they are truly hitting every single one of those intersectional boxes so I'm sorry if you are a white transgender a person you're not marginalized enough anymore I bet you thought you were but you're not it will only cover 55 people which is better than a lot of the media was making it seem it seemed like this was just a like a city-wide free-for-all program but it still is ridiculous especially when you look at the application for gift where they offer 70 gender options for you to choose from 70. including one called and you kiss your mother with that mouth you can literally determine that your gender is so apparently that is not a slur anymore according to San Francisco in this organization they also include 16 pronouns that you can choose from I literally don't know how they came up with all of these they're ridiculous or some that I've never even heard of before but the first thing I noticed was that it actually still seems pretty discriminatory because I don't see any Neo pronouns on this list where is death death self frog frog self I don't even know what the people on Tick Tock are calling themselves now but there's none on this list so thank God they have a not listed section but anyway somebody replied to a post about this and said the city is using taxpayer funds to give Universal basic income only to residents who identify as something other than biological sex they forgot that sex-based discrimination is illegal that's a good point somebody said I died when I saw unlisted how could there possibly be anything else left to list exactly what I said other people are looking at the gender somebody said what the is a sister girl or a brother boy or an aggressive AG are you telling me that if one claims to be a gender other than male or female they get guaranteed income yes they continued on they said hell call me a googly gal and send me some money I know like this this could backfire instantaneously truly somebody else tweeted out and said do you live in San Francisco are you poor would you like some free money are you okay with telling lies and deny reality go trans exactly what's going to happen time for Plan B names have also just really been exceptional my friend who runs American Manta one of my best friends in the world actually he posted this and it's at the same San Francisco giving out 1200 to trans people and then me seeing after expensive gas is that's real I mean have you seen those California prices the right to bear memes said unemployed Nancy Pelosi returns to San Francisco to receive guaranteed income for Trans people what would her name be instead of Nancy Pelosi um Nathan Nathan Pelosi there we go 80 year old Nathan Pelosi is now part of the uh guaranteed income program now I know I was you know poking fun at all the genders and the you know the transgender stuff but taking all of that out of it Universal basic income is still just a terrible idea in itself especially in this economy and many want to implement it on a broader even Federal scale like Andrew Yang who has run for president that was the basis of his entire platform that would ruin us like Not only would it drain our currently non-existent resources even more but it would be manipulating the market imagine if everybody just immediately had an additional 1200 or 2 000 every month your rent would start to go up even more prices would increase your food would get more expensive it is exactly what we saw happen when the government introduced Limitless federal student loans the colleges took advantage of that and they jacked up their prices because they knew that they would still be getting paid because students would still want to go to those universities and now the government was paying for them to so they didn't have to worry about the prices and because of this and in times like these it is so important to remember that we do not truly live in a capitalist Society what we see right now is a half-assed attempt that is riddled with government intervention and terrible economic policies it's not even like faux capitalism it's just a show basically thank you for watching the comment section if you want

bit but I just never got to when it was you know first in the news do you guys remember the big boobie shop teacher yes I remember Mr prosthetic tits who went viral in September for doing this well

that is boncharge.com use promo code Cooper at checkout to save 20 off I don't know about y'all but I'm going to be sending some of these products to this teacher because he needs some help stop it get some help he is back in the news like I mentioned because the Ontario School Board who oversees the school where this teacher Works has deemed that they do not need to enforce a teacher dress code because doing so would sadly infringe upon teachers right to express their gender identity that is a real thing here is an article about it it says an Ontario School Board overseeing the male teacher who wears massive breasts to class is recommended against establishing a staff dress code a report presented to the board this week cited concerns over human rights and gender expression here is a quote from this report it was written by the Halton District School Board it is important to recognize the impact the dress code policies can have on members of the transgender Community most notably it is important for employers to make allowances to ensure that these employees are able to express themselves in accordance with their lived gender let's just make allowances let's allow this biological man to walk around with huge Bobby milkers massive the hunka bankalus but it gets even weirder because they ended the statement with this which is just utterly backwards finally and most notably we note that if the employer desires to foster a culture of professionalism respect equity and inclusion a truly reasonable and non-discriminatory dress code or grooming standards would most likely fail to yield the intended results hey how about you grow a pair and Implement policies to keep these weirdos in line if modern day teachers are just too sensitive to adhere to or respect a pretty simple dress code we have much bigger problems at hand like they are saying implementing a a dress code for professionalism would not yield those results it would make teachers angry I I don't care if teachers are angry I honestly shouldn't even be surprised by this because you know not talking about teachers anymore but looking at this on like a broad scale we see this every day I mean Society is just bending a knee to these people's sensitivities and all of these weird fragile needs especially when it comes to like gen Z and Millennials in the workplace I was doing this business program at Berkeley I was taking like a interpersonal relations in Business course and a huge part of it was all of these reports coming down from HR departments and all of these big corporate monopolies basically talking about how they were adapting their company culture and their company structure to prepare for Gen Z because gen Z was so sensitive and I was like we have to have uh therapists we have to have all this free food we have to have you know more days off and all this flexibility because oh they're gonna get angry at us oh we have to you know involve ourselves politically that's all for Gen Z because they can't adhere to normal Professional Standards and obviously now this whole mindset has reached schools and weird middle-aged male teachers who want to wear boobs it's just it's utterly ridiculous because dress codes are incredibly common especially for teachers one person in the comment section was pointing out how this female teacher got sent home for this outfit I have the picture here she looks nice she's buttoned up she's wearing jeans doesn't even have any rips in them I can't even say that now this is a real woman and she obviously made the choice to dress modestly she is all the way buttoned up she's looking respectable but apparently that is just too risque because of her natural biological female features thankfully a lot of other people are also calling [\u00a0__\u00a0] I saw this Tick Tock video and it had some good interviews from students at the school and plus these guys just had really funny great commentary as well let's just watch this this is a video captured by a student at Oakville Trafalgar High School showing a teacher instructing the class on how to use a saw the teacher has been documented on several occasions with what people describe as very large prosthetic breasts with protruding nipples that are clearly seen through form-fitting clothes the teacher's appearance has been the subject of reports from the New York Post and network news in the states students tell chch that this is a constant Topic in class the entire school like I capture is like it's like is she it's yeah like and obviously the teachers have no say over it the Halton District School Board says they're not taking any action against the teacher saying they want to create a safe learning environment and quote ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all students staff and the community that's right so ridiculous that's right that's right I'm bro I tried I really I see other people out there that realize that this is this like absurd as me I was like I was doing a good job let's watch this I didn't want to laugh regardless of the race age ability sex gender identity gender expression sexual orientation ethnicity religion cultural observance social economic circumstances or body type or size adding that quote gender identity and gender expression are protected grounds under the Ontario Human Rights Code a statement that students say contradicts the school's own dress code that they have to follow that's exactly where I was about to go that's exactly where I was about to go in what students in order not nipples but the girls I'm pretty sure they can't wear certain types of skirts yeah because it's going to be too too reveal you can't show your shoulders one hand above the knee not higher right oh she was wearing the skirt in one of the videos it's ridiculous why she I think it violates a dress code completely and it's completely inappropriate the thing is in the dress code for hcsb like it says you need to wear opaque clothing there are pictures even of the teacher where you can completely see her nipples even the color of like you can see the color you can see the shape I just feel bad for these students that have to like deal with this [\u00a0__\u00a0] every day very distracting for students not like a good thing for like a 13 year old 14 year old kids to look at and stuff so I think teachers should have to wear a business casual outfit how do these teenagers have more common sense than this cocked School Board oh it's human rights we can't do it the students are telling you they are uncomfortable your entire job is to protect miners to encourage and Foster their learning they are literally telling you that this is absurd that they are uncomfortable that teachers are held to different standards than they are and you're not listening so don't give me any of that crap that school boards are really just there to protect kids if we learned anything over the last two years it is that they do not give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] here's just more evidence okay we're gonna continue on these are what 13 14 year olds talking about business casuals I tell you what when I was 13 14 I don't know what the business casual was but this is casuals where I thought my mom made money what do you mean by that listen this I like this interesting because whatever you want to say shout out to these kids from being able to not only present themselves super well on TV coherently but also to sound far more mature and reasonable than most of the adults involved I've never seen these two men before but I loved this Tick Tock it was very funny and I appreciated that our reactions were very in line now you might know there is some controversy and conspiracy surrounding this teacher because of a post that circulated a couple months ago and I obviously want to touch on it I'm not sure the validity of it but I would be remiss not to talk about it this is from an Anon uh he said this dude is gaming the system and on here yesterday was in this dude's class this teacher was almost fired for toxic masculinity last year as well as not embracing woke culture he dropped red pills to his class of just how silly gender digital bathrooms are and the school board hates him he is now upping the ante to exploit the very clown world of the school and Society itself created his long game is most likely to get fired and then sue for discrimination there is no other explanation no better way to troll the clown world than to become an over-the-top caricature of a woman I mean listen if this was real it would be absolutely fantastic like this guy would basically be the you know Canadian Alex Stein 99 but in teacher form it would be absolutely epic I have no idea if this post is accurate or if this guy really is some strange you know expressing his gender whatever it's believable either way which is kind of sad because of this post so many people believe that he is simply just gaming the system and trying to see how far he can go and in addition to this post other evidence people have pulled up is that this man and his prosthetic boobs went skydiving recently with somebody on Twitter who calls himself the conservative skydiving porn star here's the original post it says taking the Oakville transgender shop teacher on a Skydive this should be interesting no way that wig stays on here is the shop teacher getting hooked up in the viral pink shirt with boobs here's the skydivers Twitter profile his name is voodoo pornstar 18 plus the conservative porn star skydiver a porn and skydiving Legend and he has 20 000 followers I've never heard of this it is very weird you are kind of the antithesis to everything conservative my friend but I guess you do you somebody replied and said this guy is doing this purely to get his own back on the ridiculously woke School Board good on him if it's true another person replied and said there's quite a bit of evidence now that supports that he is authentic but even if he were not I would not say exposing youth to fetish gear even ironically is good I think that's really important point because you know this can be some kind of social experiment a commentary a troll but at the end of the day you're still exposing minors to huge prosthetic tits and nipples it's still very weird it is fetish gear it's like I want to draw the line even if it is trolling it still is just odd and there's probably better ways to do this so I don't really know you guys let me know in the comments what you think about it makes me a bit uncomfortable somebody else commented and said is he still doing it that is commitment because again this popped up in September somebody else said I hope it gets terrible back issues another person said South Park worthy yeah well that is basically the entire world right now so we really shouldn't be that surprised okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "NZDVka0Hd8Y": "what's up guys welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper so i love target i'm a woman in her 20s obviously i like target but i'm not i will say i'm not one of those people that just goes to target for fun will buy anything i know that there's a lot of girls that are like that target was in the news this weekend so we're gonna talk about that but before we do make sure that you go ahead and like this video that you subscribe to this channel if you're not already and click that little bell so that you never miss a comment section episode so target started trending because it launched its 2022 gay pride collection because it's almost june which means pride month rainbow flags so it began and part of this pride collection were discreet chest binders and packing underwear which if you don't know chest binders are for women who want to compress their chest to look like men like they don't have boobs like it's before they get like top surgery and then packing underwear is for men who want to be able to hide the package i have a package for you so that it looks like they don't have one because they want to be more like a woman you know classic stuff target has now decided to sell these people were in an uproar rightfully so now the bee posted this the target announces new chess binders and packing underwear for transgender shoppers megan basham who's actually one of our daily wire reporters tweeted about it and said target's new products to celebrate pride month include chess binders and packing underwear the tomboy x collab features undergarments like chest binders packing underwear bras and boy shorts and sizes small to 4x you can see here this is the photo that they're using in their promotions this is a real life non-binary trans something couple they seem like they're having a good time that's some of the colorful compression packing things oh jesus kill the feed i took a screenshot of the actual attire you see here pride adult tomboy x compression top beige i have i have a problem with the fact that it's called tomboy i was a tomboy i still identify as a tomboy that doesn't mean that i need to flatten my chest and walk around pretending that i'm a man so it's weird that they're conflating that with being a tomboy that feels dangerous to young people maybe dangerous is not the right word but it feels harmful for impressionable young minds there were a lot of people who came to target's defense and said they aren't binders like they're just compression tops look at the name somebody posted this in store target selling binders for pride month is so [\u00a0__\u00a0] cool what oh my god posted a picture but look at the tag on the actual items it says quote designed for lgbtqia plus community to help you move through the world with comfort and ease our compression top is a more comfortable alternative to the traditional binder offering a more snug pain-free way to minimize your chest this is not just about keeping the girls in place while you do cardio at the gym it is a binder there is no way around it might be an alternative to the traditional binder but it is still a binder nonetheless so don't try to you know throw it off as just being a sports bra somebody said it is irresponsible to equate being a tomboy with gender dysphoria yes like that's why i am so grateful that i grew up in a time and honestly just grew up with a mother who let me run around in overalls and play in the dirt and have all guy friends up until i was in high school without being like maybe she's a boy i grew up with three older brothers what did you expect let's be fair my man tits need some kind of workout okay yeah hope you're all happy now this is a good one should be binding those abdominal fat rolls oh god yeah okay look at those jelly roads jelly rolls i tell ya i'm going to the [\u00a0__\u00a0] amish market from now on bunch of political [\u00a0__\u00a0] i can't even buy a [\u00a0__\u00a0] apple anymore without some trying to be woke they're not wrong and that is a common concern and i do i post about this a lot and i try to provide alternatives to like big stores big corporations and one of my favorites is nimmy skincare you guys know i love them i talk about them daily but they are the only non-woke conservative owned skin care brand in this day and age it is so important to be able to find alternatives to our favorite products and things that we need that do support our values and for me skincare is a huge one i don't know if you guys remember but a couple of years ago sephora dropped one of their beauty influencers amanda ensing for being conservative so a lot of conservatives basically started boycotting the brand which meant that we you know didn't have access to a lot of skincare products a lot of our favorite brands we couldn't buy anymore so finding nimmy skin care has been huge because i love being able to use brands that support my values i know that i am putting my money where my mouth is so if you would like to try nemi skin care click the url that is in the description and use code cooper for 15 off of your order and your conscience will be as clean as your face as any corporation does target has the right to sell whatever they please i'll defend them there because they are a private company even though i think that these binders and packing underwear it's incredibly weird basically target is just trying to get brownie points from the alphabet mafia so the takeaway here is just vigilance schools corporations whatever you name it they are slipping this gender ideology in everywhere so open your eyes and just pay attention basically because we can't use laws and government to change the culture to fit our ideas it is never a great idea nor is it effective to use government force to completely attempt to change the culture in our direction it is our job as individuals to lead by example to attempt to change the culture and change society into something that we think is aligned with our values and is most fruitful that is something that we can do in our daily lives and andrew breitbart once famously said that politics is downstream from culture once we change this culture once we individuals do the work politics will follow and i fully understand and i know that that idea is sometimes not as popular in modern conservative circles and i mean i get it because i look at a lot of this stuff and i get inflammatory and i'm thinking oh my god this is so harmful this is awful i disagree with this and immediately my mind goes to we got to we have to legislate we have to ban it but you have to take a step back we have to look at history that really has never worked and legislating this morality it's what the left does we don't really want to be like them and i get it if you disagree but that's just my two cents on it you're welcome to disagree i think that this target stuff is weird as hell but they're still a private company so just keep your kids away from it guys

"welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper we talk a lot about the hypersexualization of our society and how that is reaching children and it's grotesque and it's disgusting and it is becoming so mainstream that Brands like Balenciaga are taking artistic liberties with things like child pornography and BDSM around children but before we get into this disgusting story make sure you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brad to check out my merch collection this is going to be a great week for shopping and due to popular demand the Polaroids are about to be back in stock so keep your eyes peeled for some good deals because as you know it's Black Friday week so Balenciaga just revealed their collection for spring 2023 and in doing so they premiered these clothes and these designs in a sort of lookbook of sorts I would say and it's just very very creepy I first saw the story through Shoon heads Twitter she said the brand Balenciaga just did a uh interesting photo shoot for their new products recently which included a very purposefully and poorly hidden court documents about virtual child porn normal stuff this is real this was on their website and covered all over their Instagram and people are just now seeing it hey Sharon Sharon you got to come see this in addition to having court documents about child pornography they also have children holding Bears teddy bears in BDSM and sexual fetish gear here are two of them in up close images and then this is the court case peeking out under the purse in one of those photos and it is Ashcroft versus Free Speech Coalition and it was in this court case that the Supreme Court struck down two parts of the anti-child pornography act which basically said that virtual child pornography wasn't really child pornography and it seems very strangely intentional that they are putting that in this campaign next to these children holding Kink teddy bears this is fine I'm okay with the events that are unfolding currently and I love this found under shoe on heads tweet it says although Shu often makes comments to cause amusement or laughter this is an authentic Balenciaga marketing photograph it contains an excerpt from the U.S Supreme Court opinion in the United States versus Williams which upheld part of a federal child pornography law so this confused me a bit because I had only seen information about the Ashcroft versus Free Speech Coalition but apparently in another photo they also have an excerpt from that case that is a pair of child pornography Supreme Court cases the Balenciaga is featuring in this campaign two different ones there's two of them did nobody think hey maybe this is not a good idea did some like weird artist creepy like oh this is like a subtle message no you freak it's about child pornography get it out I don't care if you think that you're taking some artistic Liberty it's freaking weird right out of the libertarian replied and said I am 100 more murdery than I was a minute ago siraj said there's no alternative but to resort to the wood shipper thinking about this a little more broadly it's kind of creepily coincidental that this is all coming out right now because in taking over 2 Twitter Elon Musk said that one of his number one priorities of this whole ordeal was getting rid of child pornography from Twitter eradicating the minor attracted peoples from the app all of that and this is Eliza she is a human trafficking Survivor and a big activist in that world and she tweeted this out a day ago and said wow the most popular hashtag used to sell child sexual abuse material on Twitter is almost completely cleaned out I'm not going to post the hashtag for obvious reasons but if any organization law enforcement or journalist wants me to send them the hashtag information I will it is public information but I don't want to broadcast it because there are still three old tweets available correction the three biggest hashtags used by child abuser selling child sexual abuse material on Twitter have virtually been eliminated this is huge she also has a bunch of tweets thanking Elon Musk saying this is incredible that this is one of his priorities and it's again like I said coincidental timing because when Elon took over Twitter look at this Balenciaga left Twitter oh no they didn't give a reason why they just said oh no values misalignment we're out coincidence I think not and then you you publicized this campaign this is the worst PR move I've ever seen even if you weren't leaving Twitter because of Elon going after this the selling of child sexual materials the timing is just god-awful somebody at your company needs to have more than two brain cells and figure this crap out I mean I really don't know this timing is too weirdly perfect obviously some questions are going to come up I personally don't really want to go down this rabbit hole for my own mental health sake if you guys want to that is great but if I was going to go down that rabbit hole I'm glad that I have expressed VPN to protect my search history because

bunch of creeps operating under the guise of art like I said in taking artistic Liberties because they already do weird crap like this this was their fashion show in Paris this year they're just weird like what is this some kind of war zone and that person looks like a zombie this is not art that is not fashion I get that you were trying to like elicit some emotions you're just making me angry both with the weird Kink bears and with this out of this house out of this house it's all just very strange as this story started to progress Balenciaga wiped their entire Instagram which had all of the photos from the campaign including the weird BDSM bears and then about 12 hours later they just quietly reposted them all except the weird bears and the comments have been absolutely solid somebody said we are waiting for the explanation about the fetishized photo shooting with little children somebody else said are you going to explain the gallon Barry photo shoots as people are concerned about possible child exploitation or somebody else said groomers and then of course they started deleting comments and then fully limited comments on all of the photos classic they're not wanting to give any explanation they're not actually removing the photos and saying hey yeah we screwed up no they're just saying that we don't want you to we don't want you to infringe upon our our new collection we don't want you to be talking about it now Additionally the photographer who is gallon birdie who I referenced in that last comment deleted some of the evidence from his own page he got rid of the weird BDSM bears here is his Instagram before here it is afterwards he's deleted that photo now this is obviously already made his way to tick tock there are so many videos of people diving into this going into the conspiracy theories around it is this connected to Epstein who owns Balenciaga what are the ties it's all really interesting and it's difficult to dive into but I mean here's one person talking about it Valencia website features a child holding a BDSM teddy bear remember this lock remember that lock on the child's bear from earlier well this grown adult male is portrayed holding the disgusting if this doesn't leave you feeling all sorts of ick I don't know what will it is way more than just a feeling ick it is like full body chills disgusting this is what people are thinking about when they think about children now you often hear me talk about just the broad sexualization of our society in relation to the trans agenda gender affirming care for minors but it goes so much farther than that that is just one piece of this disgusting creepy puzzle children are being sexualized in every aspect of our society and culture right now adults are way more sexualized I mean just think about hookup culture we need to like cleanse and restart because this is Despicable somebody commented and said I wish we lived in less interesting times that's a very mild way to put it somebody else said Kanye was concerned about his kids modeling and his wife is valenciaga's biggest model is that what you all about Kanye right now but it's a valid point somebody else said good eye I was in advertising for 30 years and can almost guarantee this was some art director's idea of justice for their unrecognized creative Talent they do this to bring joy to their otherwise miserable existence a disservice of the industry and to mankind I mean I get it you know you might have a tortured creative here but when kids are involved like I always say that is where you draw the line in the sand I am all for artistic Freedom push boundaries ask questions be Avant Garden crazy but when children are involved you sit the [\u00a0__\u00a0] down this crosses a line maybe it is just some disgruntled artist or maybe it is part of a broader pedophilic something that is going on I have no idea but either way Balenciaga quickly scrubbed the evidence from their website they got rid of those photos and then re-uploaded other ones the same way they did with their Instagram I have no idea whether they are ever going to comment on this there is so much money behind this brand and so many celebrities involved with modeling it like Kim Kardashian like Bella Hadid maybe they'll get roped into it I have no idea I hope more comes of this so that I can continue talking about it because it is just so damn weird breaking news guys I have an update I literally filmed this episode less than four hours ago but Balenciaga is already making some moves Balenciaga posted this on their Instagram story I have to get into character for these weird sick perverts we sincerely apologize for any offense or holiday campaign may have caused our plush bear bag should have not been featured with children in this campaign we've immediately removed this campaign from all platforms let's be real here they're only saying this because they're sorry they got caught they're only sorry because they took these weird perverted pedophilic artistic licenses and people freaked out as they should and then I mentioned earlier that they had limited their comments on all of their new Instagram posts well now all of the comments are just fully turned off I'm also noticing here that they are not apologizing for including two U.S Supreme Court cases about child pornography they're not bringing up the fact that they included pandas in this campaign with weird child King fetish stuff and you guys know probably that panda is code for you guys can look it up but it's not great and it's very in line with everything they're doing they're not talking about the fact that they had one of those weird kinked teddy bears with a lock on it and then there was an adult man holding the key they're skimming over this they're upset that they got caught and they're trying to throw people a bone unacceptable no I mean to do this from my car because I was just doing a photo shoot so I had to leave the studio but there was another Balenciaga update because I first said that they had only done one apology they have now issued a second apology and this time it is about the documents they said that they had no idea and they are going to take legal action against the person who put the documents in the photos whether it be the photographer or the creative director then they said that they do not condone child sex trafficking thank God I can't believe that that has to be said I still don't buy it this is very weird but yeah that's the update thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this channel turn on your notifications like this video and of course if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper see you next time", "BzjM-LXP4Tg": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper you know I opened up Twitter this morning and I was bombarded with a horrifying image thanks to New York Post actually that's a pretty common occurrence I don't know why I'm saying that this is anything weird I've had friends look at my Twitter feed and they're like oh my because I do this show the algorithm knows that I need terrible content for you all showing the worst of humanity so that is what I see on a daily basis I made this for you anyway all that being said we're going to talk about a mother that is just putting everything out on display with her children but before we get into that story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and if you want even more content you can follow me on Tick Tock I have a personal account and the comment section account and then I'm on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper alrighty so this is the story image New York Post thing that I was bombarded with this morning it says I'm slut-shamed for breastfeeding in public just because I'm busty wow such a sad tale and then you look at the images I don't think she feels bad about this at all she's in like a freaking Kmart and she's totally removed her shirt where's your shirt go I was breast fed I think it's fine if you're out you know and about you need to go like oh my kidneys go away you don't take off your shirt in the middle of the aisle and do a little photo shoot like let's take a little pic no do you have to do that right here I would not say that [\u00a0__\u00a0] shaming I would just say you're gonna be shamed in general because that's indecent and it's weird somebody said tacky no modesty whatsoever somebody else said is she a shop teacher yeah she makes him look normal literally you guys remember the shop teacher the trans fake boob thing God yeah they're basically the same little floored so apparently this whole thing started because she went viral on Tick Tock which sparked all of this both of these photos are screenshots from tick tocks her account is called Miss calcium cannons [Music] I'm no longer gonna call them milk jokes about me milkers oh you've got some big calcium cannons ah all right let's just watch this are you gonna arrest me are you gonna give me a ticket she literally took the whole thing off put it away like you do you not have oh no my kid's hungry let me check out real quick and go to the car you don't need to stop right in front of whatever you're buying the back to school supplies and let them all hang out no gross somebody commented and said but at least do it discreetly know a law against it but this is crossing the decency line yes I don't think that we need to legislate morality I don't want laws impeding on my day-to-day life but as a society and as a culture I think we need to realize what is appropriate and what is not appropriate so those laws do not come into place and you're all making me lose faith in that on a day-to-day basis sadly here's another one of these videos her entire page again to the store call me bro when she living off that kid is like what did I do to deserve this I don't know what's going on I'm like drunk on milk and she's again like making eyes why in a store why somebody replied to the original New York Post thing and said breastfeeding in public is fine there are ways to do it but in these photos it seems like breastfeeding in public and taking selfies is just some weird fetish for this woman clearly the focus is on the camera and the baby seems like the perfect prop yes and she is obviously doing it for views I mean her entire Tick Tock which is blowing up right now is about her boobs like I said Miss calcium cannons you don't just name your Tick Tock that unless you are intentionally putting them all out there I did not screenshot the entire page we can go look for yourself if you are interested every single video they are on display whether she is breastfeeding or not they are there she now has almost 115 000 followers she has her Amazon wish list linked there in case anybody wants to buy her presents it's just gross like just be better for your child please you've got to do better do not exploit them for views so you can feel good about your calcium cannons and I mean I can sympathize with moms I really do because your kid is getting hungry they're screaming you might have a busy day but there are ways to alleviate that and do it properly you know like when I take balance of nature on a busy day to make sure that I'm staying healthy because you know I take care of myself I eat healthy foods I sometimes exercise try to exercise but that commitment to a healthy lifestyle it's often complicated when you live such a busy life which is why I'm a huge fan of balance of nature balance of nature fruits and veggies are the best way to make sure that you are getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day their products are 100 whole food and they use a cold vacuum process that preserves the natural phytonutrients and whole

this is you don't have to take your top off in order to take these supplements this actually reminds me of a video I reacted to recently for tick tock that somebody on my team sent me which probably just deserves a permanent spot on the show because it is so gross and so indecent just watch this foreign [Music] it's disgusting I don't care if you just want to dance with your kid and post it on Tick Tock there are plenty of parents to do that you are literally grinding on your five to seven year old son that's not appropriate that's not the the fact that she once thought that that was appropriate to do in private but then also thought oh this is so great let me post it publicly that just speaks volumes about our culture in general the fact that she thinks that that is okay and will be applauded and the sad thing is it was actually kind of applauded look at some of these comments like he caught it like hey this one's all mine right here and she replied and said he knows he's my man for real for real he's not your man that is a seven-year-old that is your child disgusting somebody else said you did nothing wrong he clearly wants it no I have no words absolutely none and that's not the only video she literally has tons of these she had an original page I think it got reported and banned but she started a new one but like that's not the only video I mean this is like a constant thing in this poor kid's life look at what is written on the screen [Music] even the kid is like Mom please get away from the camera I'm gonna push you down please get out you're embarrassing me kids know more than you think and I think a lot of adults don't realize that they think oh we can just talk about whatever we can do all of this it doesn't have an impact on them no like you subconsciously are learning this you are subconsciously watching all of this understanding it thinking that it is appropriate I remember interactions that I had when I was really young that even then I was like this feels weird and then later on I was like holy crap that like man or that adult whatever that was weird we know kids understand like that is disgusting when I talk about sexualizing children and our screwed up society that exploits them I'm also talking about this it's not just the drag queens it's not just you know teaching kids about sexuality in kindergarten it's not just about putting them on you know hormone blockers when they're 12 years old all of that is bad all of these are different symptoms of this you know cultural disease we have going on of the you know sexualizing and exploitation of children you can't just plug one of those and say oh let's get rid of the you know the drag queen story times let's get rid of this and expect it all to go away no it's everything and we have let it go on for far too long we have to stop thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this channel

they're the same picture but anyway this article came out on variety yesterday morning they said Velma is officially a lesbian in the new Scooby-Doo film years after James Gunn and more tried to make her explicitly gay yay rainbow Applause The Pride people have won now I have never watched Scooby-Doo literally ever and I know that is basically a crime and I get the same response when I say that I have never watched SpongeBob but oh well all I know about Scooby-Doo is that there is a dog this pal gang of friends Gaggle whatever they go around and they solve crimes they do Mysteries they go

been trying to do this for years back in 2020 James Gunn who wrote some of the early live-action films tweeted this in reply to a fan who was asking about why Velma couldn't be lesbian and he said I tried in 2001 Velma was explicitly gay in my initial script but the studio just kept watering it down and watering it down becoming ambiguous the version shot and then nothing the released version and then finally having a boyfriend in the sequel and then Tony travone who is a producer on the TV show replied to a Fan's comment also in 2020 emphasizing this fact he said I've said this before but Velma and Mystery Incorporated is not bi she's gay we always plan on Velma acting a little off and out of character while she was dating Shaggy because that relationship was wrong for her and she had unspoken difficulty with the why there are hints about the why in that episode with the mermaid and if you follow the entire Marcy Arc it seems as clear as we could make it 10 years ago I don't think that Marcy and Velma had time to act on their feelings during the main timeline but post reset they are a couple you cannot like it but that was our intention neither of these men created Scooby-Doo or had any real sway outside of their individual projects so that's just something to note it kind of feels like these guys are just trying to hop on the bandwagon and virtue signal like look at me I was so Progressive and stunning and brave like 10 or 20 years ago I tried I really did it shut up go tweet about something else I really don't care however fans also do not care gay Twitter is losing it because they are so excited this person tweeted out and said all of lesbian Twitter about Velma Dinkley right now I mean she is a lesbian icon somebody else said lesbian Velma finally becoming a canon in October Halloween really is a gay people-only event that's nice we love discrimination here Velma being gay is actually massive we are at a point in time where this major character full of decades old history and fans gets to actually be a lesbian and that's just another part of her Canon now sometimes we need to celebrate these wins I feel like every win is like massive to them like oh this is so this is like huge this is huge progress okay not everything can be huge progress somebody else said Velma is a lesbian she's not bi and has been confirmed by multiple Scooby-Doo writers and directors that she is a lesbian stop trying to erase lesbian rap I love when there's fighting within the community it's like the buys want her but the lesbians also want her it's like you can't ever it's like guys calm down please oh you want Civil War he's got what you want yeah dude Civil War here are a couple clips from the movie and I apologize in advance but we're gonna watch a lot of them because I have a point to make and as promised here are your school s now [Music] I didn't know convicted felons were your type what type me please who has time for a a type we have our work cut out for us and I am focused like a laser on okay who am I kidding I'm Crush Big Time Daphne what do I do what do I say I think it's time we pay a visit to our old pal Coco Diablo yeah you know it's um it's completely logically sound well well well well look who it is [Music] okay so my question is in this movie does Velma do anything other than gawk over fill in Coco hot lesbian Coco whatever her name is have they totally reduced her to just a Love Struck lesbian to try to prove a progressive point I don't know if you all know about the Bechtel test but it was created in the 80s as a way to determine whether a movie was feminist enough and in order to pass the Bechtel test there must be two female characters that are having a conversation that is about something other than a man and romance and crushing on people and all of that now in its own Progressive way it feels like this is failing the Bechtel test like she's not talking about a man but they're making her entire character identity to be her sexuality and the fact that she can't stop swooning over this hot chick that's unempowering again here's another clip I'm sure Coco made some brilliant observations in the encounter we just had the cute ones right Esteban show them my brilliant observation literally I did not see one repeat clip on lesbian Twitter when they were all celebrating this they were all picking different parts of the movie like oh my God no I love this part I loved this part like is the entire film just her making this face and having her glasses fog up because she's so in love all she is doing is swooning if you want to have a gay character that's great I literally have no problem with that more power to you but don't strip them of all complexity and diminish them to just their sexuality that's actually offensive and the timing of this is just more than convenient because in classic corporate contrived Hollywood fashion they are being opportunist they didn't make Velma gay out of the goodness of their hearts because they really care about representation in Scooby-Doo no they have a quota to fill so I don't think that this is actually a win if you want to have a great lesbian story if you want to have a gay character that's great make them complex make them interesting make make it authentic don't just change up historical pieces so that you can check a box and feel like you got some Progressive body points that's not real like do better hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "MCN4zMjnzGc": "[Music] feeling like a woman oh you know this is a first i've seen drag queens put like fake boob things under their outfits but i've really never seen plastic silicon tits just hanging out while performing in front of a child which is great but you know what i will give i will give the drag queen credit because as this comment says why is the drag queen the only one to show a moment of hesitation or shield the child's eyes from this obviously adult show yes the grandmother is holding the child up being oh look at the drag queen look at the boobs and the drag queen is like oh maybe this isn't great so you know what i think that this drag queen might get it and realize that you know drag is for adults and it's part of adult entertainment", "j38FN-0LjqA": "what is up guys hello how are you guys doing today happy wednesday i was about to say happy friday because i usually do my second stream of the week on fridays but i am going to visit my brother in florida this weekend so i will not be here tomorrow or friday so we're doing the streams back to back this week um how's everybody doing let's see oh my god you guys are just going wild all right so obviously hello um so obviously you guys have seen the title of this video getting spicy in here um a teacher was fired for only fans now somebody in the comments of this article does point out this interesting factoid but it is wild that there are teachers that are sexualizing students that are putting like weird sexuality stuff and like you can be any gender you want and like let's talk about like oh when you're like you know touching and whatever like how do you feel and i look at those curricula or the curriculum and it's like oh this is for a fourth grader and we're talking about that so there's already like gross sexualization in schools and then suddenly we have this i'm gonna go over the article now um here we go teacher fired over raunchy only fans school says that she put their reputation at risk yeah you think you think the reputation was at risk look at that or maybe don't i don't know shield your eyes i don't know how old you are she's been expelled the first uh sentence anyway this teacher so not only was this this just like some random school this is a specific program it is called star base it's run by the department of defense you guys can see this paragraph here um it works with different school districts across the country to offer stem classes to mostly fifth grade students i looked it up and it like sometimes is in different grades but the majority of it is like pre-middle school stem classes the military comes in and offers it it looks like a very cool program anyway this woman was a stem teacher in this program she wanted to have a side hustle so she started this only fans and the weirdest part of this so here she is oh god let's just our society is just into a dumpster fire like why what is even happening um her students i'm so sorry this is so weird her students call her buttercup apparently her name on only fans was also buttercup that's just weird i'm looking at bobby right now i was trying to see his reaction to this he's a sheller's still out sick he's moderating the chat guys everybody say hi to sheller he sells cobin so bobby is here with me today we've shot like seven videos so i think he might be tired of me and now i'm making him listen about teachers who are being on only fans but this teacher literally had her students call her by her only fan's name is like what is that some kind of fetish it's just weird listen you can separate work in your personal life i do believe that it should be separate i am more traditional i don't bring my personal crap into work unless i'm trying to relate it to some video i guess i'm in a different situation because i often try to relate things to my personal life but in general in like a traditional work environment you know you don't mix the two and whatever you want to do on your own time that's fine but this is just weird if you are publicly doing this knowing and then you work with children it's just weird and the comments were actually very funny oh god sorry guys hello sorry um hello moving on moving on past those explicit i mean they're actually not that explicit i just don't really want to have to look at them um she had an instagram and i was going to try to pull it up and apparently it has gone away but she had some posts on there where she was going i can't believe they fired me for having a life outside of work it's like no we're not firing you for having a private life outside of work you literally had a public instagram page where you told people to subscribe to your only fans you weren't really hiding it that well kind of reminds me i was watching this tick tock video the other day of this woman and she was saying okay so my husband and i are in an open relationship and i've had a girlfriend for like a year now and we're gonna tell our kids about it but i think they might already know like what is it with all these people having these like weird private whatever around children it's just whatever anyway with that story the parents ended up sitting the kids down and the kids are like six or something like that and explaining that they were in an open relationship with the mom had a girlfriend like and apparently the mom was horrified she was like the kids were just kind of like weirded out by it and i was like yeah you think keep that stuff away from them you idiots anyway let's look at these comments um this one said if you're paying for only fans especially a 40 year old only fans turn in your man card oh god i think of all the education that i missed but then my homework was never quite like this hot for teacher oh oh this one what is this ron burgundy okay anchorman respectfully this is a very lovely looking woman but charging people money to see things um are charging people money to see these images borders on absurd considering the myriad of other options she would like to forgo her career in fashion to do so that's her right but i get i get the sense that the hourglass doesn't have much sand left that was a roller coaster i mean listen ron yeah i guess there are a myriad of other options but we live in a capitalist society i was saying that about britney spears cause she knows she posts all those photos and i was like britney like why are you posting them all for free girl like we live in a hyper sexualized society like why are you just like putting it all out there that's a whole other topic i don't know but yeah it is true if she wants to not be a teacher anymore just beyond only fans go ahead lady don't involve the kids this um oh yeah other people are saying why pay for when you can get free stuff this is just weird oh this one's heavy-hitting but if she was transgender doing kids book readings on the weekend the school board would be okay with that yeah they would be or if she was reading explicit books what horrifies me i am going to go back to the chat in a second but before i do that have you guys seen all of those school board meetings why did i just say school board school board meetings where parents get up to the stand and they pull out actual reading material from their children's curriculum and saying hey my fourth grader was given this book let me read it and they go into all of this stuff like oh and i was like embracing that whatever and it's like all hyper-sexualized and totally inappropriate for children to be reading if you're an adult whatever go ahead but children's books that are hypersexualized and the school board says i'm sorry man this is graphic content please don't read this you think it's graphic for a room of adults but you're okay with it being in children's classrooms like the cognitive dissonance is absolutely astounding to me okay i'm gonna go back and see what you guys are saying now um the last comment buttercup more like thunder thighs no comment this is the no comment comment section ah let's see uh nitrogen fume how are you my friend uh you said now that's what i like to call a mom i'd like to forbid from going within 500 yards of a school yes paul omg please tell me she doesn't teach sex ed well well she was in a stem program hopefully it wasn't anything biology related so bad oh god james crawford a teacher's only fans that's disgusting where i read uh hi james how are you uh free the knee howdy troopers yes hello cooper troopers here we go pop the knee back up it is so hot in nashville it is so hot so the knee is free today um bread greetings from long island my wife and i are celebrating our 35th oh 31st anniversary today we are both fans of your channel great show everybody you know the drill it is michael and his wife's 31st anniversary in this space we celebrate love we celebrate healthy relationships we celebrate people not being freaks on the internet so everybody wish uh michael and his wife a happy anniversary because in this day and age when everybody is getting divorced and everybody isn't happy and miserable i'm so proud that you are in a happy marriage so everybody say congratulations and happy anniversary stop talking about the knee the knee is done we're talking about michael's anniversary now guys uh okay uh a suggestion can dave chappelle join the daily wire plus assortment of figures that would be absolutely epic that would be wild um back-to-back live streams now you're spoiling a spread listen it's all just because i'm going out of town usually i spread them out if you guys like them back-to-back we can talk about it but it does take you know scheduling at all of that stuff and usually we do like to space it out so that i don't uh run my producers into the ground like poor bobby here um let's see uh idea daily wire hot ones there was a twitter poll going around that it was like ranking how hot all the daily wire hosts were but it was just all the guys candace and i were not included in it um rightfully so because you just gotta focus on the guys always i actually don't know who won it was like i think ben was excluded because she thought that ben was like a higher tier than everybody else and so then she ranked this the person on twitter like ranked all the other guys and then the final one was like the two of that person against ben i don't know if you guys want to go vote i don't know if the voting is still open but you can go throw in your uh throw in your suggestions see uh hey datadev how are you yes everybody watching go join the unofficial daily wire discord invite is daily wire i hope you are doing well datadev thanks for always being here um let's see uh i was talking to my friend who lives um ex county across country and mentioned that she should watch your videos she recognized you from her 75 year old dad who also watches you that is so sweet thank you so much for sharing that kailyn uh oh wait why did it go away i think her name is caitlyn yes caitlyn thank you um it is kind of cool because i feel like i have a lot of young people that watch the show but when i look at my age demographics it is pretty spread out which i really appreciate and i think it's cool that i can you know reach a broad range i do love the comments though where it's like like my grandma and her friends and that kind of stuff being like oh my god i'm learning so much about tic tac and i'm like yes radicalizing the grandmothers anyway i'm so happy if you guys are here it makes me happy um teachers being loose isn't new this is only a story because she isn't promoting gender theory i'd rather her teaching than groomers that's a hot take i bet i mean you are not incorrect there are a ton i mean there was a creepy ass one that was a few weeks ago and it was like this female teacher who'd been sleeping with a bunch of like 14 year old boys like i mean in um jane uh who is the guy uh franco is it j which franco was it that was sleeping with all of us yes james franco apparently he's like back in hollywood after all of his like sexual i mean he was not like a primary school teacher or whatever but he was doing classes at ucla before i got there but while some of my friends were there which is like two or three years before i got there and he was like sleeping with students they were of age though thankfully but you are right there is a weird power dynamic there this just grows homeschool your kids guys if we're gonna learn anything from this it's gonna be homeschool your kids um as a teacher there is a character clause in our employment contract regarding public behavior and second jobs a pay wall doesn't make them unpublic we are informed of this clause when we sign it i had no idea but that is not surprising to me um and yes a paywall does not make them unpublic that's what i was you know trying to say as well like it wasn't like she was just you know sending photos to one you know person a significant other or something like that she was you know if you have to pay for it people things on the internet all i'm saying things on the internet they are not private you can send something to one person you can put something behind to pay while people can screen share it screenshot it send whatever but in 2022 we should know that by now this was like a concern that we should have had in the early 2000s when everybody was still figuring out the internet but if you think that anything that you do online is private i have a harsh reality for you um but thank you for that insight appreciate it and a character clause is absolutely reasonable 100 um she wanted to be fired for media exposure now her only fans will grow up blow up next millionaire honestly yeah that is a great take probably especially since she apparently according to that article there was the thing at the end and her instagram which is now i cannot find um maybe it's under a new name i don't know i'll look it up but oh do i even want to look it up i don't know guys um but she did a post where she said i've been fired like i need your support more than ever come join my only fans so honestly you are probably not wrong we live in a narcissistic society i say that all the time i just slur those words i'm very sorry but we do live in a narcissistic society people will do anything for their five minutes of fame um if you're tired of people finding your explicit content fix that now by downloading expressvpn and get three months free using insert code here thanks no name always appreciate the consistency with you i look forward to it um congratulations on oh what is this congratulations on 31 years mr and mrs michael yes there we go nitrogen flume you win we go could be worse she could be a homeschool teacher oh well yeah but if that if that was just her own children i don't know if i would care more or care less but at least she was not impacting a bunch of other people's children without their knowledge if it was just her kids we could just have child protective services get involved i guess um let's see just saying i made two more dentist appointments for the next five days literally joe where do you live and how does that happen i literally all of my doctor's appointments all of my dentist appointments are being made months in advance i got my consultation for my new dentist man back in february and it i think i've told the story before but i literally had to schedule it three months in advance i need to leave nashville and get a dentist elsewhere um apparently but my doctor stuff is all booked out all the way too my primary care doctor who actually is a good friend of mine and he was like well if you have like something that's like urgent like i'll fit you in because you're a friend of ours but just to get on the books like i can get you in early fall and i was like oh god okay so i don't know um let's see guess who's back me so proud of you brett hey evan how are you glad to have you back um james said probably best to spread the live streams that allowed for more news to be out love watching your tic tacs yeah i agree i i usually like it too because i feel like it gives the content more time to breathe but i mean like tim poole streams every day i really admire the people that stream every day um and obviously i do the show every day but streaming is a different level i feel like i've gotten a lot more comfortable with it but i swear guys the first couple of streams i did i was so anxious because i didn't really understand the software it's still kind of confusing to me and it also is a different dynamic when you know that you can't like totally cut something out or if i like you guys know that i mispronounce things and i will like trip up on words my brain moves much faster than i can speak and it's just sometimes i get like like word salad or whatever and so because of that and i know that about myself i was so anxious and so i feel like i've grown i think i've got better at these i'm a lot more comfortable and you guys are always here and you're like the best hype people ever so i'm a lot more comfortable but i feel like it these not that i'm saying like they drain me but they definitely take more energy than just doing the normal show and just because of that factor that i want to make sure that i'm like really on and then i don't absolutely mess up everything that i'm saying um so anyway for those reasons i do like spreading them out just so that i think that they're better if they're spread out but i'm happy that you guys are here to do there's my singing again i feel like i've done that in oil let's see brett would make a great isakai see i'm gonna go pronounce mispronounce something again uh isakai anime protagonist it'll be titled that time ben shapiro got reincarnated as a gen z girl stay based in red field what is isakai is that like a part of i feel like i need to actually understand anime that should be an assignment of mine maybe we could do some kind of video because people do tell me that anime is based and that there's a lot of very cool anime i don't even know where to start but maybe i can learn we can help you with that do you watch anime yeah see look see this is why i have a team of all guys because you guys know so much more than i do about all of these subjects that i'm uneducated on uh but if you guys do want to see that i can do that let's see um there's someone with your profile photo asking people to dm them at a whatsapp number is that you no it is not we have had a bunch of those in my comments we've gotten rid of some of them they keep coming back if somebody messages you and says that they have my whatsapp number i guarantee that is not true and do not respond to them because those people are weird um i'm a math teacher and while all the political stuff is despicable please bear in mind that most teachers do not make the curriculum it is the regional state or federal offices making standards um yes and that is very very true especially when it gets to like the local like school districts and that kind of thing that's why i think it's important to go to school boards and go you know have your face in front of you know the people that are actually deciding what teachers do say and obviously there are the teachers that take those extra steps and it is helpful because they post themselves on tick tock talking about it and they usually say like this is how i subconsciously tell my like students about non-binary whatever and it's like you're you're not being very subconscious about it if you are posting it online for the world to see and obviously that's not part of their normal curriculum but they are finding a way to do that so i also think that that is important to note but yes you are absolutely right um this is part of why i homeschool my youngest i just keep getting reasons yes absolutely i mean that wasn't the reason i was homeschooled but i was talking to my mom about it before and she was saying with with how fast the media moves now and how quickly we are able to expose this kind of stuff which is a positive of social media she said it just reaffirms her decision to you know pull me out of school put me out of real school when i was younger um so you're saying they were getting that uh getting that a from teacher what do they do for extra credit ew no this is like the graduate but in elementary school oh i know i know that was bad sorry bobby's uncomfortable bobby's so uncomfortable let's see um greetings from the rio grande valley from a fellow taco hey alex uh the good things are happening in the rio grande valley out there in texas i'm glad that all of you tacos as joe biden likes to say are doing well i'm excited for myra flores uh good things happening there so that's stoked um my sister has a friend that's a teacher and was nervous about posting pictures of her with a drink in her hand on social media i can't imagine what this woman was thinking yeah exactly i mean honestly the person who said that this was probably just to get media attention you're absolutely right she probably wanted to quit her job but wanted to go out with a bang literally um no no i need like a sound board to be like womp womp like brett shut up that was inappropriate or whatever that would be good i can give myself sound effects that actually we should not do that because i would be unhinged the amount of buttons i'd be pushing um but that kind of reminds me of uh when you're in a sorority if you're not familiar with greek life uh you have a standards board and you i remember what it was for my sorority and different sororities have different standards and what you can and cannot post and do but if you are underage you have to if the rules are so ridiculous because everybody knows that like all the sweaty girls are drinking or whatever but if you posted a photo with an alcoholic beverage and you were not of age you like had to post a emoji over it or something like cover up the cup um and if you didn't you could get brought for like brought forth to standards to have the board condemn you or whatever if you got off like the bus and didn't come back from the party with the rest of the sorority he gets standard all of that stuff but that does remind me of that because i remember my sorority sisters would be worried about posting stuff let's see um do you identify as a girl boss no i do not i hate that word that's a phrase i was talking about that earlier because i took uh for a video that we're doing i took a quiz that was like how much of a feminist are you which is such a complicated subject for me and if i have any girls in the audience or anybody can chime in i'm not trying to be discriminatory here not trying to oppress the men here but it is difficult for me with like the feminism topic because i hate third wave feminism i think that it is toxic i do not think that women are inherently better than men i don't think that we are like oh my divine femininity like better than the toxic patriarchy whatever no that's bullcrap um and i don't believe that men are inherently toxic i believe absolutely the opposite obviously there are individual bad men there are individual bad women that's just how humanity works um but having said that you know five six years ago being a middle schooler high school or whatever i would have said that i identified as a feminist because i am like a strong woman i'm like not like physically like beefy or whatever but i am empowered i have a good career that i've worked for i'm pretty i'm not like dominant in like my career but i do have more you know what is classically called like male traits when it comes to like i'm you know pretty aggressive with my work and like negotiating and that kind of thing and like i will like fight for what i believe is right in the workspace um and i don't take any prisoners and that sort of thing all of these like oh traditionally male things which people would say would be you know girl boss feminist whatever but i don't attribute that to some kind of feminism i just think that that's kind of how i am and what i feel like i need to be in order to succeed in this career um and so it's kind of a weird thing because if that did not have all the political undertones and the undertones of like third wave feminism maybe i would say like girl boss but it's just i hate it all so i don't know you guys let me know um because that's a weird balance to be somebody that is you know more of a tomboy that is not a very i have traditional values but i'm not a very traditional woman in that sense and so in a lot of ways i would say yeah i'm like a first wave feminist like og feminist that i do think that i should have all the rights of a man that kind of thing so i don't know it's so complicated they have just absolutely ruined feminism they ruined a good thing ah anyway you guys can let me know what you think um congrats on making it to almost a million subs thank you so much it's wild y'all we're at seven what are we at now let's see are we at 770 no 778 i think something like that seven seven or seven seven seven crazy guys we started this channel four months ago this is insane i love you all thanks for being here um i'm a christian rapper i was trying to get in contact with daily wire but i don't know where to go any info on appropriate channels would be nice um i mean the best way to get exposure is just by you know interacting on social media and tagging us that kind of thing i can't really give any specific channels that sort of thing i didn't reach out to daily wire i was um found basically but interact with daily wire daily wire hosts online it's kind of the only advice that i can give i think um thanks james i really appreciate it yes congrats on the 77 000 subs that's insane um let's see i've been looking at the chat before the stream started and i knew no one had the balls to tell you to make it only fans through oh yeah no through super chat no they did not rightfully so because you guys know that i would shoot that down and uh berate you no i wouldn't it's just no i'm not gonna do that uh status update on the daily wire single discord will you be in the singles discord asking for a friend oh i forgot katie was going to give the name of that because she found it somebody on my team uh was the one who identified it i don't even remember the name of it can you search on discord i'm not on discord um no probably will not be jumping into any of the discords i have way too many channels and sites and pages to keep up with but for the people out there who are wanting to find a person who likes daily wire who has the same values as you if you find the daily wire singles channel put it in the chat or something so everybody can go find it also shameless plug you guys know that my friend has a new dating app it's called cuffed making dating apps wholesome again go check it out it's not in the uk it's only in america right now so go get on there it's very very cool they're a great bunch of guys who created it um where am i going oh gosh everybody it's like somebody come in at once and then i have to move down ah oh no okay for anime a good starter is demon slayer do you know that one yeah it's pretty good bobby has other opinions i think um if one of the daily wire stars got elected to potus and you had to be part of the administration what would you do oh [Music] my job would be the fake intern that biden hired to make the tick tocks what was that guy it was like the content creator who they brought in and he was the fake intern and he was like oh my god we have to get everybody vaccinated it's on brand for the work that i do no i really don't know um what what is the job that i can have where i could just abolish things where i could get rid of different government agencies something i would probably not want to be in like the administration probably want to be if i had to be in something i'd probably want to be like a senator or something like that i don't know um okay let's see uh if you're look if you're looking to start watching anime you can never go wrong with dragon ball z i have heard of that i don't know anything about it but i've heard of it there are hundreds of episodes god damn it see this is just intimidating already i live in new hampshire and one of those appointments is for saturday morning like i can't that's another thing okay this is joe again we're talking about the dentist this is can you tell that this is a sore spot for me love you joe i'm so happy that you live in new hampshire i've never been to new hampshire but i've heard it's very free i've heard it's very beautiful i would love to go in the fall when the leaves are changing sounds delightful um but that's one thing about nashville and the south nashville is a very rapidly growing city and there's a lot to do and i feel like it is you know kind of growing into a it's not a physically big city but it's growing in something that has like a very you know vibrant energy and that sort of thing but it is still in like the traditional southern mindset in a way where it kind of reminds me of chattanooga which is where i was raised where literally everything will close at 5 pm it's like open from 9 to things are not open on saturdays or sundays you can't get appointments for the weekends that kind of thing and so i think when i moved here when i was in boise i kind of adjusted my mindset for that and it made sense but i was in l.a prior to that and then i came to nashville thinking okay this is a bigger city things are going to be more like la i'll be able to go get food at 11 p.m at night i like working at coffee shops there's no coffee shops here that are open past 7 p.m like i was the person in l.a that would be at the all night like boba coffee shop until you know 2 a.m writing papers and that sort of thing off campus like they weren't even like campus coffee shops and i can't do that here are you so bobby's from new york how do you feel about it i like being able to get coffee at any hour of the day or night should we start a daily wire coffee shop that is open past 7 p.m yes i'll be there great you know where to find me guys no there is literally no such thing in nashville and so yes i'm so glad they have done disappointment on saturday or something but i there are that's not possible here maybe it is i just need to find the right dentist who knows but it has been an interesting thing to watch unfold okay um okay isakai different world is a genre of anime manga and light novel popular in japan in which the protagonist finds himself trapped in a fantasy world oh okay that's kind of cool oh so that's what you were saying about like ben becomes a woman that's interesting okay thank you so much nitrogen fume i appreciate it uh best teacher i ever had was a retired flint michigan cop for one of my criminal justice classes that sounds badass i love that um words are hard bret 2022 yes guys they are it is a daily struggle i appreciated the fact that on my blooper video that i did people were because that really exposed how much i mispronounce things it's just it's become kind of like a gaff i guess i was texting somebody earlier and i was saying i need to have somebody like reading a dictionary in my ears at all times so that i can get some of these words correctly like i said i think my brain just moves so fast and i can't i get so distracted and amped up and energized about stuff and i just can't keep up but anyway we are working on it maybe one day i won't even have bloopers but you guys seem to like the blooper reel so i mean i am human and i do make those mistakes but it did what i was saying is that it did crack me up because a bunch of you guys were being like oh even though she tripped over like those words she still like speaks better than kamlar biden so at least i'm winning there oh god um how do i join the discord please help um people in the chat can you tell luce how to join uh a discord channel i think it's just talking about the is it the daily wire one of the daily wire singles if anybody has any information loose somebody please help because i'm bad at that my mom was a teacher and i've taught in nursery for years i've had two girls go through regular school i would never let my youngest go to regular school that says a lot it says a lot um can you talk about ezra miller i don't think i've seen your take on his arrest and cold pretty please it is super interesting i actually should do a deep dive episode so bobby and i did an episode for my facebook page and i think it went up on my snapchat show as well but i don't think i ever did one for comment section maybe i can do a little bit of a longer video and talk about it i don't know if there have been any updates because he's still on the run right have there been any updates uh i haven't seen any updates okay basically ezra miller is an actor i think he is now non-binary um but he essentially groomed a native american girl starting from the age of 12 who was a fan of his brought her on set with him flew her all over the world took her to like montana she didn't have any id she wasn't able to get like a license she had no medical records that kind of thing the big question is why weren't her parents involved we really don't know um but there is our restraining order against him on behalf of her and authorities are trying to find him to serve him for that and to get more information for this grooming because obviously there was some really gross stuff going on and nobody has been able to find him so that's sort of what's going on and he's been posting like memes about it on instagram the whole world is just a hot mess like why is that something that we joke about and post memes about if a guy like a predator is on the run and he's just oh yeah i'm gonna post memes on instagram like what anyway so i'll see if i can uh see if i can put together a longer episode and do a deep dive uh my bangs keep falling i feel them it like itches my head when they fall okay that's why you keep your drinks in a nondescript cup there you go oh yeah you're talking about the sorority stuff yeah exactly red red solo cups not distinct enough um what is this okay uh oh no hola quick question uh he actually said a lot i'm not just i'm not being jill biden i promise a quick question what's wrong with young women burning their tubes from that day to the day that they regret the decision so many babies could be saved um oh okay so we're talking about okay so i was actually at the doctor two days ago and i was sitting in there and i i literally i am no exaggeration within the 10 minute span that i got there signed in and was waiting i heard two phone calls from different people calling the office to ask about getting their tubes tied like is that could not be normally common and i asked the lady about it and she said well yeah since like all the ruby weight stuff there's been an influx of people of women sterilizing themselves and if you do it in such a way there's a specific procedure like a way if you have if you have the right doctor or whatever where it can be reversed but it's not totally effective it's kind of like vasectomies where i think vasectomies are more easily reversed but with tying your tubes it's very very very hard to undo it but there has been an influx of women especially young women just going all right cool well now i can't get an abortion gotta go get my tubes tied like permanent birth control which is probably heightened by the fact that so many people in my generation and with millennials who are saying i'm never going to have kids because i don't want to destroy the environment or why would i you know bring children into this corrupt capitalist world i think to quote whitney houston i believe that the children are our future why would you tie your tubes my friends come on anyway so yeah that is something that's happening um uh it's refreshing to see a woman be so smart if you run for president i'd vote for you prez thanks so much deadpool i appreciate it thank you uh can you play zelda breath of the wild a resident evil village uh the one of the only video games i've ever actually played all the way through is zelda ocarina of time i think the next ones that i'm going to play are going to be some of the more i guess contemporary i don't know how contemporary those all the games are that you're talking about i know ocarina of time was a while back but i am going to play like call of duty and halo i'm getting an xbox if you guys you guys have asked like where does the chat revenue go it goes to my equipment which next will be we just got some new lights it's very exciting i feel very pumped up here if you have noticed we upgraded the setup with my new tower lights but i will get an xbox in here so that i can play and i think it would be fun if i got some of the guys to come in and like play call of duty with me or something like that i'm gonna rope them into video games because i have been roped into video games by my team so we're doing this now alrighty let's see um i'm going to use your uh yours and bet shapiro's face for a future gender reveal if it is a boy it would be ben's face if it's a girl over your face your face that's actually very funny uh if you do please film it and tag me in that um that's iconic if youtube uh brings the band hammer would you move to rumble or only release content on daily wire i have no idea i've never had any strikes um so i don't really think that i am currently at risk of that um but who knows maybe just moved to anywhere we already have that platform set up but i do like the fact that i'm you know i'm not in the traditional daily wire model and i'm more of like a daily wire plus um thing and we do keep my content on youtube specifically because my audience is so broad and i have a wide wide range of ideological diversity and so i want to make sure that like i'm not just you know i'm not limiting it yet because it is growing really fast and so it's very cool to see so i'm not really sure uh hopefully that does not happen uh in your opinion what do you identify as boyfriend and girlfriend material is that like a good relationship or like boyfriend or okay i get what you're saying um [Music] that's like i mean it is very i feel like it's specific to each individual person i'll try to make some general statements though one overarching theme that i noticed and that i at least try to you know do myself is that i see a lot of people both men and women who set very very high standards for a potential partner saying like i want her to look like this i want her to do this whatever whatever for women it's like i want him to you know have this body make this much money whatever and be this mature and have all of this and then they don't hold themselves to that same standard so somebody that would be like you know boyfriend girl for material whatever is meeting your standards but also and i guess this is not really answering the question but i do feel like it's an important thing to say if you have those standards whatever they may be whatever you are looking for if you are not holding yourself to those same standards if you are not working on yourself daily not the whole like oh i just want to like know myself before i date somebody like i think that that is true but also that's kind of fluffy language but truly work on yourself so that you can be a good partner for the type of person that you want to attract and then don't complain about the fact that you cannot get somebody of that caliber because you're not doing the work yourself so that was not really answering exactly the question but i do think it's it i don't know i thought that was important to say but we're i go for material um oh god um not narcissistic because like i say we do live in a very narcissistic society if you have you know if religion is very important to you don't compromise another thing somebody that is in accordance to your values if you know at the get-go that this person if you have disagreements about very like things that are close to you about where you see your life going about religion about political things whatever and i don't mean you need to sit on a first date and say like you know like oh what are you like tell me your entire life plan and how many babies are we gonna have or whatever but you can pretty easily figure out somebody's values and how they live their life and don't go into something knowing all of that because it is going to you're going to get emotionally invested you're going to get physically invested and it's going to be so difficult to unwind it so do not do that um don't think that you could change people uh but honestly mutual respect if you don't respect them don't go into it um trustworthy is huge no matter the situation so i mean these are all very general things because i don't know you and i think every person is like very different shared interests um that you can like a very important thing to me would be like if you don't have to be doing something at all times if you can just like sit and be with the person i don't know but like trust mutual respect and make sure that your standards for yourself are as high as the standards you were setting long-winded explanation but anyway there we go uh do you watch ben shapiro yes i do um for brett's pants fun so she can buy pants without holes and then zoomers got it rough in this economy if you can help pitch in love your compassionate and level approach everything thank you thanks so much richard i appreciate it uh finally i mean i have shorts on right now so i guess i need longer pants maybe but um i actually don't buy them because oh you have um i get my wardrobe here usually well some of it it's very like it's a it's a hodgepodge because like i'll bring in stuff but then they have things like for events and then they get because i it is difficult when you're on camera every single day and it's like i have what i usually wear which probably doesn't look great on camera um and so i do know that the uh some of the people in my audience are like brett i see like the holes in your pants and that sort of thing but anyway my most of my jeans do i will work on getting a couple pairs where they are covered up uh let's see game suggestion life is strange doesn't require a lot of skill in terms of gaming life story line not having a lot of skill is or not requiring a lot of skill is key yes um okay so he said give the knee back i'm it's resting it's resting um attack on titan themes of propaganda nationalism is that a anime it's a very good enemy bobby says it's very good you got high praise hey red how about a range day video uh i will actually be probably going to the range this weekend with my brother because that's what we do my brother and i when we get together we do a few things every time one we hang out with all of our dogs because i bring my dogs and he has three dogs um we always go shoot guns we usually do things on his boat we eat a lot of tacos jill biden would be proud um we'd make a lot of margaritas because my family loves margaritas so i'll probably be shooting some stuff this weekend um i'll try to film some of it maybe and i'll post it let's see uh oh no where is this perhaps tierramax restarted only fans know ew yeah right as you typed that you should have known no but here's the thing taramak that's the woman that's the that is the state senator the state senator in rhode island who was twerking upside down on her tick tock she did that and then she turned around and said vote for me which is like very much describes the state of our society right now but uh i feel like she's doing that for free already so i don't even think she needs to know the fans um do to do me 23 tom boy conservative and a social worker row overturned on my birthday best birthday ever happy birthday sadie or belated birthday i'm glad that was a good birthday present for you uh that is awesome i am also a tomboy that is very cool and i really admire that you are a social worker that is a very hard job um and the people who go into those fields like you know that you're going into something that you know requires a lot of empathy a lot of grit so i admire that immensely so have it have you here do you already know or plan on ever learning any other languages oh god or too tongue tied for that i mean i got grant on yesterday because i was doing that whole jill biden episode i have to talk about it um and there were a bunch of comments with like spanish words and i was talking about all this other stuff and i read a word that i thought was spanish and then at the end i realized oh my god that's literally an english word i was just so in the taco jill biden headspace i didn't realize that um so clearly i'm already mixing up i did okay so i did three years of spanish in college um but i will be honest i passed i got a's and b's bobby don't laugh at me he's laughing i'm fast but here's the thing i passed with the help of a lot of extra credit some of the extra credit were things like take salsa dancing lessons i'm so sorry um anyway so i can here's the thing i can read spanish just like i can read english very very well i'm a bibliophile i can read just fine i can read spanish somewhat still it's been a while but i was always better at that speaking it very difficult i also took latin i did latin in middle school in high school which helped with the spanish clearly didn't help that much but anyway so i would like to learn another language i'm kind of scared because i already i already messed up so many words in english imagine if i went to another country uh and was trying to speak and i just couldn't even i would already i would just look like such an idiot but maybe that's a video series brett learns a new language um my uncle is italian and i absolutely adore him and he and my aunt go to italy every year and i've always said that i think it would be very fun to go with them and like you know learn some italian and go because he speaks it so maybe that's what i would do um okay let's see ben may destroy the lefts with facts and logic what is people like you that will save the culture thank you so much that's really actually very very kind andrew do you guys hear that bang we have a lot of construction going on in the studio right now uh when guys realize they don't have to be leftist to find a woman the culture will shift that actually you know what hopefully that will because i do see a lot of people you know i there have been a lot of a lot of fallen men my friends especially in my life who are very you know not even like ultra conservative just like based with common sense they meet a leftist girl she converts them and suddenly they are like i don't know the most lefty sjw whatever and they do it for the girl and then they're you know parading lefties afterwards because they think that that's the only way that they will get a girlfriend it's not i promise um anyway if you're looking into anime watch the full metal alchemist you'll never look at dog filters the same way again the guys will know never heard of that no idea what you're talking about i'm glad that other people get it finally catching a live thankful for you and your takes on everything blessings thanks so much logan i really appreciate it yes halo f yes i am going to play i'm going to be so bad at it but we're going to have fun let's see oh people are saying that there's a code daily wire but we need a link to join can anyone please okay can anyone please send in the chat or put a link in the description guys this is still loose people are saying that there is a code daily wire for the daily wire discord put the link in the chat for loose or so everybody else can join uh datadev if you're still in here maybe you can take that um let's see bro why don't you start and only fans of people buy a subscription they get nothing but pictures of oscillating fans is it oscillating or oscillating oscillating oscillating ah the sea got me oscillating um i had a friend that was made a joke and was like um i should start and only fans but it's only pans and it's just like wholesome cooking videos i feel like there probably are ones out there let's see i live outside of nashville i love to meet uh i have run into a bunch of um folks that do uh live here it's like especially you know when i'm shooting videos out on the town i usually run into people which is nice uh uh ola again hey uh an anime i recommend is dr stone all right so many did you do all right are you taking game suggestions for when you have the xbox my three favorites are skyrim shadow of war and battlefront ii i've heard of skyrim i've never heard of the other two though uh what do you should play bioshock let's see looking forward to cooper troopers being classified as far right extremist group by the south by southern poverty law feds in the chat say hey yeah which is ironic since so many of you guys are not even let or like right leaning at all um but you know they'll call anybody that moves from the sjw narrative a far right extremist so whatever um thank you so much angelica really appreciate it uh do uh hybrid i live in the alamo city san antonio texas next time in nashville i'll stop by the future brett's coffee cafe congrats new success thank you so much i really appreciate it um i do love texas yes um gary gary am i saying that right i hope i am i don't know guys give me i you should know now that it's just stressful um but i do love texas i don't go as often as i would like to but my and uncle do live in austin and i have a bunch of friends that are in dallas houston so i go relatively often um okay speaking of the coffee shop this reminded me of something it's not exactly the story but i did have a video that i wanted to show and i'll probably wrap this up because i'm going to go film something we're doing bobby and i are doing another video after this he can't get rid of me yet he just rolled his eyes he loves me um but do you guys remember i did a short and like a tick talk about it um there was a coffee shop in canada that was like the anti-capitalist coffee shop and it was apparently co-op owned and all of this stuff and it was all over priced coffee and they sold merch and all of this stuff it was like you are no matter how much you say that you are anti-capitalist you're a socialist coffee shop you are literally making money in the marketplace you are engaging in a capitalist system so i wanted to show you this i'm going to pull it up on twitter it's up now if you want to pull it up um this is uh so they posted this and it says new yorkers can take a bite out of capitalism by munching on popsicles shaped like the heads of billionaires jeff bezos bill gates jack ma uh elon musk and mark zuckerberg bird berg um in brooklyn look at this let's just watch this oh no i need to turn up my volume there look at that eat the rich ten dollars ten dollar popsicles it tastes good a little strawberry creamy it doesn't taste like over 100 billion dollars but it's my god a startup if you are a startup you are starting up in the capitalist world you are in the marketplace you are engaging in a capitalist economy it is so backwards um the comments were funny brought to you by capitalism the city that is peak capitalism hates capitalism nothing says i hate capitalism like somebody using capitalism to sell ten dollar popsicles to protest capitals ten dollars for a popsicle no go to costco if you want a cheap popsicle get the ones in the big the little like push pop summer things you eat at the pool if you're trying to not be capitalist i don't know you're still being capitalist because you're buying it from costco but anyway um and they sell it for ten dollars p capitalism in my opinion yeah exactly people this is how it's how gullible the left is i'm gonna go back to the chat um this is how gullible the left is is that if they see something that is like oh i'm gonna eat the rich and it's all like you know anti-capitalism if they see something that is marketing that they will throw their money at it without like with all caution to the wind even though they are literally supporting what they claim to be so against but that's classic isn't it so anyway thank you for indulging me because i did want to watch that um let's see uh if you haven't seen avatar the last airbender it is the best way to ease into anime i have not seen it but i've heard of it do i miss tacos from los angeles yes i do every single day the mexican food here is i mean it's good but it's not it's like nothing can be up to par texas is cool and all but florida has rhonda santos yes it does um have you guys seen the new video that he posted on instagram it's honestly really dope it's like he's like oh and it was when when it's great um okay more games how to get people to not vote for you 101 step one twerk on camera but here's the thing people were into it and that is so scary people on the right and people who just have common sense who are you know middle of the road whatever we're saying oh god this is just let's just not do that like decency can we have some decency but so many people were going like yes like free the body like body positivity like she's a state senator again it's like if you are in the public eye maybe don't post things or you know be publicly ridiculous anyway guys i'm gonna get off of here i'm leaving a little bit early today because bobby and i are gonna reset and we're gonna film this other video uh but thank you for sticking with me and hanging out for two days in a row which is super fun um hopefully i will have some good stories from florida with my brother it's always a good time maybe i will sing an alligator he did get oh my gosh see tribute over my words he did get his gator hunting license last year i don't think i'll be going gator hunting but maybe he has the stories for me i'll try to keep you guys updated i'll do some content about it it'll be a good time but ever anyway i hope everybody has a fantastic fantastic weekend i will see

off the clock that's not traditional comment section stuff so be on the lookout for that soon i'm gonna go because bobby has his finger on the trigger ready to go um so anyway all right i will see you guys later bye you", "UkwPSIqhn30": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper you guys have been tweeting this story at me dming it to me saying oh my God are you going to talk about this don't worry yes I am I started planning to segment on Saturday when I unfortunately had to watch this video I really wish that I had one of those eye wash stations you know when you're in chemistry in high school and probably just in normal Labs but in chemistry in high school and you have the eye wash stations I needed that after watching this video today we're going to talk about Antonio Brown before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection so Antonio Brown he is an Infamous NFL player he randomly quit in the middle of a game last year I believe uh so he's currently a free agent but I also think he's saying that he retired he's wide receiver he played for the Raiders the Steelers the Patriots the Buccaneers as well and he definitely has some form of CT e which is even more evident based on what he did earlier this spring in Dubai let's just go ahead and watch this video [Music] [Music] he's waterboarding here he's giving her the longboard oh my God my God okay first of all like dude why are you giving this all away for free to the internet didn't you know there is only fans my dude I don't know like there is just so much to unpack in the story I'm very excited but first of all if you guys also want to unpack some free meat you should go check out good ranchers because right now good ranchers is throwing an epic October Feast where you can get four pounds of free meat if you go to goodranchers.com Cooper in the news promo code Cooper at checkout that's two pounds of wagyu ground beef and 2.5 pounds of their better than organic chicken and that comes free with any purchase of one of their bundle

of us can support so go check them out take advantage of this incredible October offer go to goodranchors.com com slash Cooper and use promo code Cooper at checkout back to some free meat that none of us asked for I think I'm gonna be sick never saw this video on New York Post uh they put it up on Saturday and apparently it happened on May 14th but they just now got this video they said video Antonio Brown exposes himself to stunned guests in Hotel pool and it's kind of hard to tell in the video because it is so short and obviously everything is blurred thank you very much newer post did not want to see that but apparently he and the woman had been you know sort of having some fun and then he just started going very Buck Wild and then the guys are outside of the pool kind of egging him on and I can't tell if they're going like oh no he's waterboarding her or oh hell yeah he's waterboarding like I just can't tell but either way it's weird it's inappropriate and he just took it way too far another one of the commenters pointed out the guys in the video because Newark post didn't write about it at all they kind of just more oblivious to that but she said why did you cut the comments of the other men in the pool egging Antonio Brown on that were part of the original story The Men Who were cheering on his behavior and joking about him waterboarding the woman when he dugged her in the pool this wasn't just him it was a group of men who he wasn't with who contributed to make this woman no doubt feel completely intimidated if not terrified and again I don't know the story firsthand but if I was that woman I would be absolutely appalled and you can sort of see her laughing in that stereo but again if you're very uncomfortable you're usually going to be like uh-huh please don't touch me and then sheep swam away obviously because the guy was whipping things out in front of her face so there's a lot that is problematic about this story it's just vulgar it's bad behavior and it absolutely took the Internet by storm this weekend A lot of people were calling him on the inappropriate behavior and then obviously making jokes because guys it's Twitter in 2022 it's the internet somebody said the most critical detail here is whether or not he stated his preferred pronouns prior to the sexually deviant Behavior because if he did not explicitly State he him but we can safely pretend that the thing doesn't exist and we're not allowed to be offended regardless of reality people were very mad about that comment and I really enjoyed it now the person said odd he's a pretty good receiver and not known for dropping balls there's a video replied and said looks like he's going long hmm that's unfortunate oh yeah here we go and then of course they obviously had to make it about race because uh if you did not notice already Antonio Brown is a black man so they obviously brought that into it and somebody said nobody was shocked shooked or stunned you all at Newark post with these headlines it was obviously consensual even though the men were filming and egging him on she was all like hmm and cheesing it up for the camera this is how a black man gets set up just saying he should be careful so just because he's black his bad behavior gets to be excused like we don't know whether the one was comfortable or not we do not know whether it was consensual all we do know is that he was whipping his bare ass and his dick out in her face and wrapping her in things and she got thrown into the pool and immediately swam away and did not look back at him I would be pretty uncomfortable in that scenario even if I knew the guy she would have to be out of her mind on the same drugs he was if she wanted to enjoy that like seriously an absurd comment but this honestly just gave Antonio the ammunition he needed for his comeback as he hopped on Twitter and he said it's crazy to me that even after I retire there is disinformation coming out about me ironically during a time when the NFL is getting heat for allowing players to play when they're clearly concussed they've been using black men as guinea pigs okay and then he goes every chance I get to sway the heat off of themselves they use me in the video you can see she runs off with my swim trunks if the roles were reversed the headlines would read a b having a wild night with nude female yet when it's me it automatically becomes a hate crime disinformation dude we saw the video that that is not disinformation the article really didn't speculate anything it was just like hey he was naked in a pool with a woman who looked uncomfortable you know I don't know much about Dubai but I am guessing the public nudity and sexually lewd behavior is also very illegal there probably even more so than it is here so thankfully people called him on his [\u00a0__\u00a0] this person said disinformation bro you literally whipped it out in a hotel pool that's the other thing this is not some private Paul this is not his pool where he can do whatever he wants you are in front of people there were just random people swimming trying to have a nice vacation in a luxury hotel in Dubai and suddenly you were naked somebody else said so no white players get concussions yeah that's sort of what I got from his comments another person said define hate crime SMH get some help my guy you need counseling somebody replied and said bro if a b was white it wouldn't be as big of a deal as it is no I would still be very upset about it because it's disgusting and it's inappropriate and people are making an even bigger deal about it because of his response and because of his previous Behavior he is not the most even-keeled NFL player he has had his fair share of controversies in the past he is just adding fuel to the fire but to me honestly the wildest part of this Twitter frenzy was what he posted before those race statements like look at this he said she messed with my Ops do that to be Petty I still get the top of the club I'm too deady heavy he also said my name more precious to be diamonds and gold why y'all keep playing with my character they tried to bury me I forgot I was a seed dripping sauce like I'm chilly please don't make fun of me I'm not a rapper and I don't know whether this is rap or not like it just seems like he's attempting to be off-brand Walmart Kanye you ain't been doing an education because those tweets don't even sound like they were written by the same person it's like his PR team swooped in and thought that racism trademarked might be the only way to fix this problem which ironically did not never does he did end on a classic note though after his two paragraphs about how all of this was just because of the color of his skin he tweeted this and I doubt his PRT came up with it but he said I'm telling every team that needs some offense to pick up a b because he's shown that he still has the ability to expose the D at NFL because wide receiver exposing defense football puns he's making jokes he seems unbothered and I kind of I mean I highly doubt that anything serious will actually come of this because he's he's a protected class he's Elite he's Rich he's an NFL player athletes act out all the time and really nothing happens they keep playing so maybe he'll get picked up by another team I have no idea and the sad part is I also don't think anything would come from this situation because our society is a flaming dumpster fire like we live in a world right now where people think that it's totally fine for people to be naked and grinding on each other at Pride parades basically having sex publicly in front of small children in the name of Tolerance and acceptance so if that's okay it makes sense that people are going to be like okay well whatever we'll move on this guy just whipping it out at his own pleasure in front of random people is totally fine like our society is a mess we have lost all respect we have lost all decency we don't care about tradition we don't care about keeping anything private anymore and it's sad and it's just a representation of how far we have fallen and now I'm just upset but that's kind of where we are right now hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "dSDqjo00WXw": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper Halloween is now over I'm filming this on November 1st and in my mind November 1st is the beginning of the holiday season I was listening to Christmas music this morning which people might find very controversial I do not care I am the person that buys eggnog the moment that it hits the shelves because in my mind the holidays and Christmas it is a season and you might argue that Wilbur you have Thanksgiving Thanksgiving is a day there are no Thanksgiving songs maybe there's one Thanksgiving movie Christmas is the season now and I am now in the Christmas season but before I fully launch into that I want to do one last video about Halloween now last week we prepped for Halloween on Friday and I told you all what you could not dress up as according to what guidelines to make sure that we were all creating a safe space for everybody involved so now let's do a recap on the costumes that some celebrities thought were appropriate because they all claim to be very Progressive and yet they decide to do things like this but before you get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you're not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com to check out my merch collection so first of all one of my favorite couples to discuss because they never fail to give me very very strange content Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly they are recently married they apparently drink each other's blood in blood rituals they are the carbon copy of I think it's is it Kourtney Kardashian and the other weird drummer what's his face they just got married too Kourtney Kardashian and uh Travis Barker the other wet cigarette the three wet cigarettes or Machine Gun Kelly Travis Parker and PD I don't ask me to explain it it's just how I see them Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly decided to be Catholic for Halloween literally just decided to be Catholic look at this post he said on Sundays we take communion what the hell what is that blood in that chalice so she's taking she is on her knees in some weird BDSM something something on a leash taking communion and Machine Gun Kelly looks like he is high out of his mind he probably is I would say objectively that that is quite distasteful but not very tolerant and accepting of them now to be fair I don't think Megan Fox Machine Gun Kelly really obey any politically correct rules because they are so strange but they are very Progressive like outwardly so the comments on this post were a huge white pill for me because everybody was calling her out on their [\u00a0__\u00a0] somebody said yeah you're officially on crack yet literally Machine Gun Kelly looks like he is on crack another person said notice how Christianity is the only religion that is openly mocked and people find a comical yeah it's the only religion where you can do things like this and you won't get canceled shockingly broken generation broken Idols how much more attention do these two want it's apparently never ending it's all they live for there's another comment that I actually really liked this woman said I could give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about Catholicism I rejected that when I was young I'm talking about thinking of what their children have to see after they post this all over social media y'all can say what you want but no teen boy in his right mind will want to see his mom leashed like a dog unless he is sick and I'm really sure Cassie does not want to see her dad snorting coke off of his girlfriend's tit which in their second Halloween costume of the weekend he did that and it is publicized on social media very classy it's great y'all can dick right all you want but respect other people's opinions about it we are allowed to be grossed out yes that right there imagine having children and this being the example that you set Megan Fox has three children which are surprising to a lot of people and Machine Gun Kelly has one who is 13 years old I am not asking you to be the most traditional buttoned up Suburban family hell that's not what I came from at all but have some damn class and think about the image that you are portraying for your children the lack of respect for religion the gross sexual images that you are promoting the fact that your children's friends are going to see these images if not now somewhere down the line and think about them when they think of your family and think of your children for God's sake you're a bunch of friends degenerates like I'm serious imagine in five years time the machine on Kelly Megan Fox Clan they're sitting around having a nice family dinner maybe they're eating a good ranch or steak and somebody brings up this image what do they say they're just gonna sit quietly be like wow this good Rancher steak is fantastic and I mean it is because that's probably the only good thing happening at that dinner table especially because good ranchers has a 100 satisfaction guarantee and they are incredibly cost efficient that's because once you get a good Rancher subscription your price is locked in it does not matter what happens with inflation what Joe Biden does to the economy you know that you will be paying the same price for your food every month and this holiday season I have an even better deal for you as a special gift for my viewers good ranchers is going to be giving away two Black Angus New York strip steaks free with your order I'm talking two 12 ounce Steakhouse quality 70 value steaks for free with your order you do not want to miss out on this so go to goodranchers.com Cooper and then use promo code Cooper at checkout to redeem the special offer again that is goodranchers.com Cooper promo code Cooper at checkout and hopefully the meals you eat with your family this holiday season with good ranchers will be a lot more calm than anything going on in the Machine Gun Kelly household it's just weird it's just disgusting I'm not trying to cancel you for it but have some damn respect and if you're going to ask everybody else to be kind and loving and tolerant you need to do the same moving on there's another costume that could use some growing up in a more literal sense and this is Billy eilish and her new boyfriend Jesse Rutherford now Billy is 20 and Jesse is 31 they are both musicians and they have sort of been dating kind of quietly but over Halloween they made it official picture of them hit the gram all of that stuff and in response to people speculating about their age Gap and them being in the tabloids they did this this was their Halloween costume that is her as a baby and him as a grandpa well I'm out of here goodbye everyone girl that is not helping the fact that people are saying that he is a groomer and that this is pedophilic you are literally portraying pedophilia in your Halloween costume I get that you're trying to make fun of the situation but I feel like that probably was not the best move I'm seeing comments here on the post that last slide is interesting babe she does not give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] at all and I love it somebody else said let's not pass over the fact that she dressed as a baby and Jesse is an old man jokes about pedophilia are not funny another person said not the baby and the grown man girl delete this I do not care who you date it is your life if you're both consenting adults age gaps are fine if you're in the same stage of life you guys get along I do not care but don't parade around making everybody incredibly uncomfortable if you're not if people are speculating that the guy is a creep and the young woman is too innocent and doesn't know what she's getting into but don't perpetrate that further with this kind of spectacle I love this comment on Twitter I think it's summed it up well Billy has grown enough to know how weird and creepy this is by the way absolutely and you know what if she is not mature enough then maybe she should not be dating a man that age in the first place now moving on speaking of other old men with grooming habits really just sliding on in there let's talk about Joe Biden's costume he dressed up as the president I guess because apparently he needs to convince everyone that he is not a deep fake a puppet or a plant and probably so that he could just sniff some kids here we go here's a nice video of that happening at the White House oh yeah oh the lean oh a nice one I do not care if my child meets the president nobody is going to give them a smack on the side of their face or kiss on the lips if it's Joe Biden because you know that's what he does it's just weird caressing the leaning in I know that some of you might not be the biggest fan of trump but we all have to admit the little minion that he tapped on the head and put the candy bar on wholesome fantastic content bring it back right now I'd pay a million bucks for that thank you very much now unlike Joe Biden Jill actually did dress up she dressed up as a fairy but her wings were on backwards and upside down but you know what that's kind of on brand it really just shines a light on the incompetence that goes on in our government now that I think about it that's really depressing I mean it literally looks like Biden put the wings on for her which might have been the case but you know considering how confused they both were last night his dementia might be rubbing off on her because look at this video neither of them knew what they were doing they both did the classic where am I bite and move should we go this way do you get that oh I'm gonna Walk This Way wait honey where do I go where's my Handler somebody oh no help the point where do I go oh then the run because guys he's fit he'll do a little jog don't worry I'm mentally well I'm physically able no you are literally not every time you give a public speech you go off the podium the wrong side and then look sad and Confused like an old puppy dog I don't care how many ball caps you wear and how many jump starts you jump into as you're walking away you cannot convince anybody that you are physically and mentally sound and that is sad and I blame the people in your life that have propped you up in this position Biden it is elder abuse that is spookier than anything else on Halloween so that guys is your 2022 Halloween recap I'm so excited to leave that all in the past because as you know I don't like scary things I don't like people telling me what I can and cannot do and apparently that's what everybody wants to do on Halloween so now we're really going into the holiday season it's my favorite time of year so buckle up okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "qoWJxsyGKkY": "i'm stephen pamplemoose the ceo of a company we all know and love but might not always pronounce correctly now some people will say lacroix others lacrosse those are actually both wrong the correct way to pronounce the name of this drink is actually look and so the next time you decide to pop open a refreshing you can sit confidently knowing that you got the facts now we didn't got that out the way my old roommate used to unironically call this drink lacrosse depending on how you feel like they might taste it could be kind of an accurate description in the comments somebody said lacroix lacroix liqueux whatever tastes like somebody ate watermelon an hour ago and then burped in the vicinity of an open water bottle another one it tastes like somebody whispered the name of fruit through tv static i won't have any of this lacrosse slander here i freaking love that tv static beverage sponsor me", "CI7qxiyxYEE": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I was about to say that rally and protest season is not over yet but then I realized basically in this country it is year round like last year in January I was at the anti-vaccine Mandate protest and the pro-life March uh in freaking January in the freezing cold in Washington DC we just had a rally here with Matt Walsh just a couple of weeks ago so it really is just a year-round phenomena I guess but there was a pro-women rally held in New York City and things not really go as planned before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already or ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection a biological human adult female women's rights rally was held in New York City yesterday and as you can expect there obviously was a counter protest because this rally was held in the Cesspool that is New York City and it got wild I think we should protest Raleigh was organized by an organization called standing for women it was held as the stop the Erasure of women rally here is their poster 4 at 1 pm 14th of November City Hall Broadway New York City and the far left trans activists had planned ahead they have this little poster here transphobes not welcome my favorite part of this is that there's a little sign they have a boot and they're stepping over one of the pro women ralliers and it says I had it coming so you're basically saying that these women out peacefully rallying and protesting and doing speeches that they had your violence and your vile Behavior coming we're already starting off on a really really great foot on a stomping foot actually according to that poster they said turfs and anti-trans allies are ending their Nationwide speaking tour here at NYC our voices are louder than their hate bring your noise makers and signs to show them that New York City is not the platform they're looking for from PDX to tri-town we show up and shut turfs down uh our voices are louder than their hate actually your hate is louder than everything literally even before the rally began and the speakers reached City Hall there was already a significant police presence because it had started to get crazy they first began instigating things in small groups kind of amongst themselves and just who everybody's aware we're gonna be watching a lot of videos today some of them are not so pleasant so just be aware I guess this first video and a lot of the ones we're gonna be watching are from Andy no he's from the post-millennial he is fantastic and he posted antifa and violent far left militants attacked the attendees of the women's rights event outside of NYC City Hall one of the leftist militants hit a black person as they often do pretty accurate I mean they're ballsy hell yeah there we go I appreciate how that black eye was so stoic though and he was like don't like just kept putting his hand out and then you see all these guys that are so much smaller than him like running around like little ants it's like hey bugger off like you and your masks they're all just psychotic somebody said is this a peaceful protest uh and somebody replied and said mostly fiery but baseball then of course they obviously started taking off their clothes and threatening women this is the best one in my opinion the most confusing part to me is that first of all there's this like um person man woman next to him but this guy is like screaming I'm gonna beat your ass these hands are discriminate like throwing all these fists and then like Midway through like every few seconds has to be like I'm so hot oh let me just pull that like are you like threatening people are you trying to be seductive everything has to be sexual with these people it's so weird also at the beginning of the video I have no idea what gender this person is what is that in the beanie they were like shaking themselves around like trying to move their boobs around but really the only thing that was moving was their beer belly what is that what the hell is even that this person said women voted exactly for this I mean you're not wrong look at the Electoral Maps which is depressing but you know what it's a true fact so I'm gonna read that comment anyway we have all seen the election Maps although like this election season is midterm season I think it was more gen Z's fault like gen Z voted for this social crap they also voted for us to basically be entering a recession right now which is why you need bullying Max because at the rate we're going to be totally honest guys it looks like inflation is going to be a problem for a long time and yes you might have cash on hand you might have an emergency stash what about gold and silver those are the important Hedges against inflation and the best way to diversify your portfolio and Bully and Max has the answer and I know this might sound intimidating but bully and Max really makes it so simple I mean they are a direct to Consumers retailer you never have to deal with a salesperson and these medals are shipped directly to your door fully insured you don't have to worry about a thing and as we dive head first into the holiday season this is the perfect time to give somebody the gift of Financial Security go to bullyingmax.com to check out our holiday giving guide and to get your discount on a patriot bundle again that is bullionmax.com Cooper and you know what they might not be able to be a hedge against these crazy protesters but at least they help secure your finances we have a mental health and a drug problem in this country if you do not realize that just by watching these videos just by logging on to Twitter once in a while I don't know what to tell you these people are unhinged Blair white replied and said what better way to prove you're not an abusive man than threatening to assault women mic drop and according to Annie no and Tim cast the person that was screaming in the center there is a New York City Pride organizer and a model who often works for Brands like coach has actually been in Times Square has had huge billboards so this is not just some Rando this is an influential person in the lgbtq community in New York City here's more from them actually because they did not stop unsurprisingly oh God there's a person in the beanie again again there's like I look so hot let me as my like my protest Chic it's so strange if you want to convince people that this is not all about sexuality and you truly are just trying to be authentic then why are you taking every opportunity to be seductive and be weird and sexual you are shooting yourself in the foot with everything that you are doing literally everything nothing is working whatsoever if I actually wanted to believe that you were doing this in good faith which I genuinely can't I don't know if they could after watching this video it's just so strange somebody replied and said at the end of the day these two dudes will end up going to the urologist not the gynecologist accurate another person said Violent Men never change no matter how they identify it's a harsh truth but it is a reality and that's a it's a hard way to look at it but it's real as you saw in that video New York City PD had put up a gate to keep the counter protesters back and in those two videos we were just watching it seemed like they were sort of respecting it they were leaning over leaning the the fake titties over the gate but that did not last for very long peaceful mostly peaceful they're just here to promote love and tolerance they're grabbing police officers they're threatening women it's all up intolerance there we go it's sort of breaking through over there I mean this went on for a while here is another angle of that same thing they start pulling the gate like the stand with woman rally is so small like look at those people back there they're not making any movement they're holding up their signs these people are losing their freaking Minds okay so apparently this person like did something to the cop and then the cop reached back and now they're like probably gonna say that the cop is my God these people you can say what you want about cops and I obviously have my own thoughts about the law enforcement system and the institution of law enforcement itself but like holy crap like these men and women that you saw in those videos they are brave because these people are psychos to put it blankly you have to have a mental fortitude to stand there while people scream these things that you shake their tits around this is different than the normal things that law enforcement has to encounter like it's not theft it's not you know pulling somebody over for speeding it's not a shooting I just I have massive respect for the people in those videos because that is just wild more cops ended up showing up even the counter terrorist part of the NYPD they declared it an unlawful assembly and quickly began arresting agitators almost all on the counter protesting side it's just like a chaotic scene oh my God stupidity in action and you know they're going to post on social media this verse was arrested for doing nothing but standing up for love and tolerance and you see another video in that person's like pulling their shirt off screaming grabbing a police officer trying to like threaten the rallyer and then as this person pointed out under that video I just showed you look how the Legacy Media is painting this entire event this is from the MSN this is their headline trans Advocates and far-right protesters battle outside of city hall and then they have pictures of a cop pinning someone down to the ground far right protesters trans Advocates no this was a women's rights rally that was intended to be peaceful until these people showed up you guys saw those posters stomping on transphobes you were asking for let's let's show them their hate doesn't belong here let's drown them out these are not happy peppy people wanting to accept and love everybody they are coming here to drown out the people that were coming to fight for women's rights stop spinning the story and stop believing these people somebody else said can we all agree to start calling them antifem and somebody replied and said trans tea fan is what these women have chose to call them which I actually really love I'm gonna add trans Tifa to the list of words and catchphrases that I use here because that is just too good these people that you saw in those videos they do not actually care about acceptance and tolerance and I know that I say that a lot but it's a point that I think is important to be driven home at literally every single opportunity because they give us a lot of opportunities to do so they don't care about loving you and you know hearing your voice and active listening unless you are one of them they don't believe in living in harmony with all of us they want violence they want to take kids from their parents they want control and honestly that's putting it mildly okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "3vED2NruQqU": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper guys we are talking about Disney yet again because Disney cannot stay out of the news whether it's some weird political thing they're doing or they're kicking their CEO out in the middle of the night or they're doing something ridiculous at one of their theme parks which is what we are talking about today but before we get into that story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell so that you never miss a video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Tick Tock and on Snapchat and on Instagram and on Twitter the options are literally Limitless okay so I actually was describing all the different reasons that Disney is in the news and I think I said you know stupid CEO stuff political things and their theme parks well we have all of that in one story today and I didn't even intend for that to be how I introduced it but you know what kind of works so Splash Mountain one of the iconic rides at Disney World in Disneyland is being shut down in Disney World and is being replaced with a themed Princess and the Frog ride but it is not as innocent as they want people to believe so here is their announcement it is from the Disney parks Twitter account breaking news we are one step closer to going down the bayou as Walt Disney imagineering reveals a new scene from Tiana's Bayou Adventure come on down to the Disney parks blog for the inside scoop and then here is a picture from what the new Splash Mountain is going to look like like Yay this is so great like just a little change we're just switching it up it's so innocent just yay Tiana's Bayou Adventure I actually really really love Princess and the Frog I think it is a fantastic movie it is one of the only Disney films I have seen and I thoroughly enjoyed it but this is not very innocent they are doing this because of racism obviously because why does anybody do anything in 2022 here are some actual reporting on it from Forbes they said Disney's Splash Mountain to close in Florida in January amid racism concerns nearly three years after company first announced it like this article says this has been anticipated for a while and Disney has been talking about it because Splash Mountain has this horrid awful racist past that they must get rid of but they're finally doing it when I have gone to Disneyland I have ridden Splash Mountain countless times it is one of my family Lee's very favorite rides like I do not stand in line for hours for many rides but I will endure the hassle and the inconvenience of waiting to ride Splash Mountain because I think it is such a great ride I will not however endure the hassle and

less time on tasks like that and more time trying to see Splash Mountain before Disney closes it so Splash Mountain which opened at the parks in 1989 is based on a very controversial Disney film Song of the South which was released in 1946. now Song of the South has been totally wiped from Disney's portfolio because of its racist undertones it is not on Disney plus you cannot just buy it through Disney or rent it you cannot get a VHS or a DVD you literally have to Pirate it or go on to eBay to get old versions of the film because they have suppressed it so much so here is the old trailer it is up on YouTube let's just watch it together in case you are like me and you would barely even heard of this film oh [Music] this is motion picture storytelling at its best well sir Once Upon a Time not your time no it's my time but one time I was going fishing good morning good morning girls here is entertainment so refreshing so heart lifting so satisfactual you'll want to see it again and again sadly we can't see it again and again that right little rascal who loves to live dangerously you'll meet that crafty frustrated villain rare Fox forever scheming to catch and cook rare rabbits didn't want to be ready in a minute now I have to just put a few more sticks on fire get fire going good foreign bear big bumbling and not overly bright [Music] yes Walt Disney's Song of the South has all this and more and there is Walt Disney's cartoon fun to give you that Zippity doodle feeling it looks so cute it is literally a film about that old man Uncle Remus telling those kids stories it's very very innocent it's set in the Reconstruction Era right after the Civil War and it follows that young boy he moves to the south after his parents split up to live with his grandparents I believe and he befriends this Uncle Remus and then Uncle Remus tells him all of these stories it seems very tame that trailer was precious wrong it is severely racist it must be canceled according to the guardian the film itself is hard to stomach on its own these people's takes are hard to stomach on their own they go on to write the word slavery never gets uttered but surely Uncle Remus James Beckett the evuncular black man of the film Center was once property of the plantation he calls home the creation of folklorist Joel Chandler Harris Uncle Remus is known for his brayer rabbit stories and he becomes a father figure and a friend a seven-year-old Johnny a white boy visiting his grandmother's Plantation his parents grapple with some Untold problem in their marriage ramus's sensitivity to Johnny Farr exceeds his parents coldness and neglect but that warmth comes with the implication that men like ramus and the housekeeper Aunt Tempe played by Hattie McDaniel are only human insofar as they serve the needs and the Destinies of the White characters that notion persists in films deep into the 21st century too so you can't even have a black character be kind to a white character and help them out because that means that they are only a sideline character there to help white people no that's just Humanity that is two people connecting and telling stories and being friends it does not have to be in engulfed in racism just because it was written in a certain time frame does not mean that it is inherently racist this is a very sweet story but that is not all that is not the only racist thing there are plenty of examples of pernicious racism in Song of the South that are right there on the surface thank God goody goody for me can't wait here's one example the minstrel C the minstrel sea of the animated characters particularly rare Fox the slang in the dialogue a Wandering chorus singing traditional black songs and most notoriously of all a fable where brayer Fox and bear bear use a tar baby to fool and ensnare brare rabbit that part didn't make Splash Mountain yet the subtle low point of the film comes in remus's narration just before zippity-doo-dah when he reminisces about how things were a long time ago when every day was mighty satisfactual if you'll excuse me for saying so he adds twas better all around I would have thought that having a chorus singing traditionally black songs would be representation aren't you Patrick Star don't you want that I'm confused about your goals here and if that's the case this must be you'll want it if you actually put Black Culture or minority culture into a film then apparently that's racism but if you do it their way then it's actually just representation that makes sense to me then take it it's not my wallet and Zippity doo-dah is a song about looking at the bright side of life and it won an Oscar but oh God no it is connected to racism so it even had to be removed from Splash Mountain in 2020. now critics of the film and people who hate this one little section with Zippity doo-dah they're upset because a white man wrote this film so then he allegedly made this black actor talk about how things were better in those earlier days and the implication is that he is singing about you know being happier when slavery was there we don't know if he was writing about slavery in the context of the film this character is saying that he was happier in his younger days when he was so connected to all of these fun little animals these are stories that he is telling about his past they're just putting this accusation on the film and on this writer when we have no idea if that was actually what they were talking about and that should have no implication on the song Zippity doo-dah those can be two separate issues why ruin a perfectly good song that made the ride arguably much better just because of what it was connected to it's so stupid anyway because of all of these quote atrocities the film has been canceled and it has been you know hidden and suppressed into Oblivion back in 2020 Disney CEO Bob Iger was asked about it being on Disney plus and this was the response this is from an article they said unlike some Disney titles that come with certain content warnings on the Disney plus streaming service Song of the South will never be available even with an outdated cultural depictions disclaimer on the platform Disney CEO Bob Iger addressed the issue back in 2020 as the streaming service started its roll out of classic titles during one of Disney's shareholder meetings Iger answered a question about what Will and what won't be made available to stream from the Disney Library adding that this film is quote not appropriate in today's world and therefore will not be re-released I mean it is a freaking children's movie that was released in the 40s and yet according to Bob Iger and Disney and all of these 2020 critics the world today is just too sensitive and too unintelligent to appreciate sweet stories that come with this film and to understand historical context when looking at art I mean it is offensive that Hollywood thinks that we are so dumb the comments on the trailer demonstrate how ridiculous this is because they are overwhelmingly positive like people love this film especially people that are like the age of my grandparents who watched this when it was actually released like this person said say what you will about the content of the movie but that integration of real footage and animated cartoons is really well done and was probably ahead of its time it was and James basket who played Uncle Remus won an Oscar for the film you're suppressing a film with a leading black actor the man is known for this role it's so ridiculous somebody else said I never considered This Racist I thought that he was a wise friendly elderly man who could tell a great story somebody else said I watched it a few days ago out of curiosity I thought that it was such a beautiful movie about a man telling stories to children at the end it literally brought tears of joy to me because it was truly a great film I mean I could go on just go read the comments on that trailer people love this film for a myriad of reasons now before writing this episode you could have been holding a gun to my head and I would not have been able to tell you what Splash Mountain was based on even though I've ridden it countless time to Disneyland like Disney has suppressed that film so much that modern audiences who are not like huge huge Disney fans don't even know about this so-called racist past except the social justice Warriors that are screeching about it every single day social justice one two three like I love Splash Mountain but also I do love the movie Princess and the Frog and I'm glad that it's getting a ride but why replace one with the other for Progressive brownie points like that is what bothers me somebody replied on Twitter and said I hate this idea of replacing iconic attractions because of people getting angry over nothing use the time that you would be using on re-theming an already amazing ride that can't be made better story-wise to start working on attractions that are actually new high tech and fun like that's what we say about Hollywood all the time they claim that they are you know uplifting minorities they are increasing representation but they're just shoving these people into already existing stories and remaking the films and audiences are upset about it if you actually want to uplift minorities and people of color create new stories give them the benefit of an original authentic film or TV show or ride or whatever like this isn't actually progress somebody else echoed that sentiment and said Disney shouldn't ruin a great ride by shoehorning another theme onto it Bill Tiana a new purpose-built ride perhaps using Tom Sawyer Island as any Hurricane Katrina Survivor can assure you there are no mountains in New Orleans I mean entertainment is being poisoned every single day by a pervasive victim complex and this need for sensitivity warnings and political correctness and now it has made its way to theme parks like the stupidity is never ending okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this

year and it is just a bunch of people being actually racist we talk a lot about racism and how people are faking it and they will take a crumb and turn it into a cupcake like I can't believe that's so racist but the things that these people are saying they are actually objectively racist but before we get into this make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already

days ago so it has been making the rounds again has gone viral for a second time for good reason and you will see why what are white people Superior at this exactly a white people Superior they're real good at violence violence genocide it's like stealing people's lives just because they feel like it if you are white and you you know this is happening and you say nothing then you're a killer too gentrification appropriating things that do not belong to them taking over other people's cultures and making you believe that they invented repurposing it's like recycle and repurpose how about claiming that you know they are actually a whole separate race when actually white DNA comes from the black female so what exactly are white people Superior honey lion stealing and cheating manipulation withholding information lying telling lies my God now I want to preface this by saying it's not racist to have a problem with somebody who happens to be a certain color that would be something that would be very beneficial for the Left To Learn because then they would realize that not everything is racist is mayonnaise racist no Patrick mayonnaise is not racist horseradish is not racist either these people are so ridiculous they literally inject racism into everything everything like what's next am I gonna be racist because I drink my coffee with cream in it the only way I'm gonna be anti-racist is drinking black coffee well to be fair I would drink black coffee if it was Black Rifle coffee Black Rifle coffee is very selective when it comes to how they Source their beans and they're disciplined in ensuring freshness in every single bag I mean it is so good you do not need any of that basic [\u00a0__\u00a0] creamer and I'm saying that to somebody that almost exclusively drinks pumpkin spice lattes but I will drink their coffee black in fact Black Rifle coffee are the only coffee beans we keep stocked here at the daily wire my entire team loves it so if you want to be drinking the same coffee then all the comment section folks drink go to blackrifle.com use promo code Cooper to check out for 10 off your first order or if you subscribe to a new coffee Club subscription again that is blackrifle.com promo code Cooper at checkout and you will happily be drinking black coffee and you can be anti-racist so that all of these people in this video will shut the hell up this is blatant racism because you're making generalizations about an entire group of people purely based on the color of their skin that is literally the definition of racism now every group of people every color of people every you know class of people has a certain set of people that happen to be dicks but that does not mean that the entire race acts that way and that is what they are insinuating and the fact that they just get away with this and they're so smug they're like yeah all white people do no give me a freaking break now of course you know I'm gonna mention it but imagine if the roles were reversed it's incredibly hypocritical and I always say it's important to bring up these hypocrisies because it might open up somebody's eyes somewhere down the line to realize this absolutely backwards World we're living in imagine if me a white person said that about any black person I would be absolutely canceled run off the face of the Earth we literally cannot even bring up statistics without getting emotionally involved about other communities and people whether or not we're talking about race or not without getting deemed bigots racists homophobes whatever meanwhile they get to spew this utter nonsense on the internet with no ramifications and obviously it's their right to say it I don't believe they should be kicked off the internet for this but it's just wrong and it's backwards somebody commented back and said quote taking over other people's cultures says the black woman with dyed blonde hair it's 2022 and why are we still talking about skin colors it's literally how I feel I feel like we should have gotten over this issue about 40 years ago somebody tagged this video of Biden in the comments this clip is from a speech bind gave in 93 I believe where he was advocating for the crime bill this is what he was saying about black people because they literally have not been socialized they literally have not had an opportunity we should focus on them now if we don't they will or a portion of them will become the Predators 15 years from now and Madam President we have predators on our streets that Society has in fact in part because of its neglect created another person commented right after that and said actually it's not racism it's called being anti-white there I fixed it for you and then of course there were people that flooded the comment section saying oh I totally agree with them I'm awful I'm a white person I'm so bad like this person said LMAO some of your comments are proving the point of this video you just can't handle the truth some of you are also in need of a serious history lesson and a reality check wouldn't hurt either lady you just sound sad and like you're happily turning yourself into a victim I guarantee you are not as happy as you could be Tyler Fisher who is a comedian and he was an actor and Terror on the Prairie jumped in with an edited version of the video that he made last year when it first came out that exactly represents what I was talking about earlier the hypocritical nature of what they're saying what exactly are white people Superior smelling funky letting their egos control their every move privilege making Bland Foods playing the victim congratulating themselves over [\u00a0__\u00a0] that they're incompet to that or that should have already been done they're Superior big dicks what are Native American people Superior at corn mazes what are Hispanic people Superior at smelling funky insecurity what are Asian people Superior at oppression gaslighting lack of empathy intellectualizing oppression did I say oppression what are black people Superior at they're real good at violence violence is like stealing people's lives just because they feel like it taking what's not there taking [\u00a0__\u00a0] taking our ideas so Tyler's caption was this is the most racist video about white people and it's socially okay here I switched the races is it still okay absolutely not can you imagine if that was publicized by the cut and they were saying those things about Hispanic people about black people about Asian people about Native American people that like comment about corn mazes freaking killed me no it would not be okay this is the most simplistic thing you can do and it just demonstrates it perfectly like all you have to do is just change the races and it immediately becomes okay like why is it acceptable for people to say all of those things about white people to laugh about those responses be like oh that's so accurate oh my God those white people there is a double standard we live in it literally every single day if you take one thing from this video that you didn't understand before I hope it is that somebody commented and said I think the first one ate a few too many white people I understand wanting to advocate for Injustice however doing it with a blind misguided over generalization seems to be how they think it'll get solved what have we ever solved with this energy it's a game they don't want Solutions spot on like I could not have said it better myself they are continuing this victim cycle because it makes them Rich it gets them attention they feel good about themselves meanwhile we don't actually make any progress if we actually wanted to move forward to society with love and actual tolerance and actual acceptance we would have the mindset of Morgan Freeman in this clip which a lot of people were posting in the comments section Black History Month you find ridiculous why you're going to relegate my history to a month oh come on what do you do with yours black history is American history how are we going to get rid of racism and stuff talking about it I'm gonna stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man I know you as Mike Wallace you know me as Morgan Freeman it's so good he's absolutely spot on then I have another clip here that also demonstrates this point people also put in the replies my grandparents are black all eight of my great great grandparents all 16 of my great grace on my mother's side my ancestors were enslaved in Alabama on my father's side we were enslaved in Texas I am not oppressed I'm not oppressed and I'm not a victim I am treated with kindness dignity and respect literally from coast to coast I have three children they are not oppressed either although they are victims I've taught my children they are victims of three things their own ignorance their own laziness and their own poor decision making that is all putting critical race Theory into our classrooms is taking our nation in the wrong direction racism in America would by and large be dead today if it were not for certain people and institutions keeping it on life support that point right there exactly and some of the people keeping racism on life support are the people that believe that they are a protected class where they cannot be touched yet they deserve the right to be able to spew racism on everybody else that is not going to fix any of your problems what is going to fix some of your problems is leading a life like that man right there taking personal responsibility for your life for your actions for your trajectory and finding something that is going to actually give you some fulfillment and I guarantee being a victim will do none of that so fix it guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a

amazing her name is gracie producer gracie she got engaged this weekend it was incredible i went to atlanta for it it was super exciting but producer gracie was not the only person who got engaged this weekend as of friday jennifer lawrence and ben affleck are engaged jennifer lopez and ben affleck are engaged if you think you're feeling some deja vu it's because you are this is the second time they've been engaged they started dating for the first time in 2002 while they were filming a movie they got engaged 11 months later and then they broke up in 2004. do a little recap so i didn't know this but apparently jlo has a personal newsletter it's for her inner circle as she calls it and that's how she broke the news to fans she posted this video on all of her social media and then directed them to her site on thejlo.com actually that's pretty clever all right let's just watch this it's quick so i have a really um exciting and special story to share honestly kind of crazy so if you're not part of my inner circle uh you have to go to onthejlo.com to hear this one i don't know if you guys know what that is but it is my inner circle where i share my more personal things and um this one's definitely on the okay is it just me first of all or does this little clip give you like major indie film sundance film festival vibes like the shaky camera movement the giggle the emotion it's like brie larson at the beginning of her career i feel like i'm intruding maybe that's the point because we all want to be part of her inner circle did you get that ma your boy kevin malone is in the inner circle she directs us all to on the jlo.com now i tried to sign up and get some intel for you and i now finally have but on the day of so many people were flooding the site that it literally crashed so i missed the newsletter that was announcing it but everybody knows now so i think we can move on to the internet's response first of all if this seems like a bit of a whirlwind it is because up until 2021 jlo was engaged to baseball player alex rodriguez they lived together they had a blended family it seemed like everything was going according to plan apparently not things have not gone according to plan for jlo six times now in honor of ben affleck and jennifer lopez getting engaged let's have a look at all six engagements that jlo has had her first engagement was with ohani noah who was a waiter in cuba the two of them got married in 1997 but they divorced 11 months later and here's a look at the engagement ring which was estimated to be at least six figures next was her second husband and former backup dancer chris judd this ring was also estimated to be in the six figures and they got married in september 2001 however the two of them divorced only eight months later her third engagement was the doctor ben affleck he proposed to her in 2002 with a ring that's estimated to cost 2.5 million dollars they called off their engagement in january 2004 and jlo has described this relationship as her first real heartbreak but that heartbreak didn't stop her from marrying singer mark anthony five months later this engagement ring might be the most expensive one with an estimated price of four million dollars these two ended up having twins together and a divorce in 2011. six years later she began dating baseball player alex rodriguez and they got engaged in 2019. this ring cost anywhere between one to five million dollars and they postponed their wedding twice due to covid this wedding ended up never happening and they called off their relationship in april 2021 that same month she got back together ben affleck and the two of them got engaged a year later this ring ben gave her was more expensive than their first one with an estimated price of three million dollars and only time will tell if these two actually end up getting married is anybody else exhausted i'm heading home so as not to have to be here anymore that's so many rings that's so much engagement in a in in quite a short amount of time i don't think i could do it i would walk away at that point like sayonara can't do that anymore anyway apparently jlo perseveres the internet obviously has a lot of thoughts the red sox lost to the yankees today but ben affleck and jennifer lopez are getting married which is a historic victory for the city of boston ben affleck is from boston jennifer lopez 75 this is my personal favorite look at all the rings and i know it's not a competition but how the did jennifer lopez get engaged twice before i even got one boyfriend the pandemic has now lasted for two jennifer lopez engagements maybe we should just start tracking things based on jennifer lopez engagements like oh that was before the og ben affleck oh that was alex rodriguez time you know good work there were tons of people shaming her for all of these engagements and then getting back together with ben and i mean listen six engagements is a lot it's a bit ridiculous and i especially feel for her kids who have been dragged all over the place where these different men have lived with so many different people but you know what she seems happy so you know what live and let live maybe this is the one that will stick but i i i don't know i'm not saying get back together with your ex and live happily ever after don't quote me on that but like come on people people grow and either way we'll see if they go through with it and if they don't it'll be great content for me so i think it's a win-win either way do you want to be the only person

guys welcome back to the comments section i'm brad cooper so there was a lot going on in the past week or so there was the grammys the oscars march madness transgender visibility day i'm probably missing a couple but i've talked about most of these events on my show and all that being said there have basically been limitless opportunities for cringe woke corporate pandering in the past week or so and these companies did not disappoint so i thought it was only appropriate to do a little recap for you let's start with oreos they are no longer just milk's favorite cookie they are also the gay's favorite cookie apparently they released a short film this week uh to celebrate eating oreos and being a hashtag lifelong ally to the lgbtq plus community now i've watched this film multiple times by now and i think i'm finally starting to get the gist of it it really just screams dramatic artsy troubled student film it's basically an asian family and the teenage i think he's around teenage years teenage son is preparing to come out to his extended family and he's nervous they eat oreos obviously he writes a letter about it he kind of he's practicing his mom comes in and comforts him and says you know she loves him no matter what which is probably the most genuine and cutest moment of the whole film and then they just flash some like lgbtq oreo woke ad promo stuff at the end it honestly is not the most jarring film i've ever seen it's just kind of cringey and like definitely over the top but this is not the first time that oreos have dipped their toes into the woke waters they made especially colored oreos for every lgbtq flag is that an umbrella name for like all the flags the the internet had a lot to say about it this one was one of my favorites what gender does my cookie identify as i don't know about gender but in looking at those flags probably every single sexuality in the book you're a cookie company yes their cookie company a company that stands for what is right okay yeah but you're still just a cookie company so get over it will you be advertising this in china or the middle east no no no no no no obviously not because this ad is designed for woke white liberals to make themselves feel good when they watch it and go buy oreos finally this ad is made i wasn't sure what to do i felt so guilty eating a cookie because i wasn't sure what it stance on lgbtq issues was that one is satirical but literally there were people in the comments that were like that they were like thank you oreo thank you so much here we go coming out isn't difficult it isn't controversial if it was you wouldn't touch the subject coming out is so safe and mainstream that multi-billion dollar cookie manufacturers calculate that they can make even more money by supporting it that's it that is the tweet that sums it up moving on to number two in our lineup this actually might be my personal favorite cracker jack the classic all-american very traditional baseball snack i'm not the biggest baseball person like putting that out there but i do have very fond memories i used to go to the chattanooga lookout baseball field all the time with my dad i would eat cracker jacks i would eat ice cream out of the little like cups that look like baseball helmets it was a great time yesterday crackerjack announced a new part of their business cracker jill that that's not a joke at all it's literally a new product that they have released and they even produced a feminist rendition of take me out to the ballgame to go along with it take me out the ball again take me out to the crowd buy me some peanuts and crack a jail no one can stop you if you [Music] play ball damn the sass at the end really coming in hot okay maybe it's just me but i am getting major christmas album vibes with this song back to the most important part this whole thing is just ridiculous also there's that line where she's like we're adding our face to the game it's 2022 our faces have been in the game women's sports aren't new they aren't revolutionary it's disappointing because the left has ruined feminism and like girl empowerment because if i had seen this 10 years ago while i was growing up i probably would have thought the song was super cute like yay sporty girls like that's me like i am a girl and i grew up as an athlete i should love this but these days i know that it's all just political pandering and that they don't care and once again like with oreos it's just a box that they're checking the comments these probably were my favorites out of everything that i'm showing you helen says cracker jill contains no nuts saw cracker jail trending and i thought we'd come up with a new nickname for racist karen's yeah that's that's unfortunate this is no way to talk about the first lady call her doctor cracker jill you ass do they don't think that through like could they have not picked a better name cracker jane but you can see it's not just one cracker jail cracker jill is every woman she's blonde she has blue hair as you know some nice woke sprinkled in there we've got an asian we've got a black girl we've got everything jill sees no bounds also they're doing this little like flexing thing it gives me major rosie the riveter vibes which again is sad because rosie is epic don't touch rosie i had a poster of rosie the riveter in my room growing up again ruining classic female empowerment jeremy's razors which is our razor company uh chimed in now that there's cracker jill i realized we haven't stepped up our virtue signaling maybe we should start jill's razors that is a brilliant idea i cannot believe i didn't think of that literally since day one i've been getting dms from women being like when are there gonna be women's razors we want jeremy's racers but for women i don't make those decisions but we could jump on this it'd be fantastic now this is the last ad this ad was not posted on instagram or twitter anywhere on facebook anywhere on reddit even on reddit looking for it it was only posted on this company's latin american youtube channel so without further ado welcome to a 40 year old latinx transgender quinceanera sponsored by pantene my pelotene [Music] [Music] estoy [Music] first of all let's go back to this little like family photo they do those are his kids on either side of him they get to that later in the film those are his small children maybe i think those are his parents and then maybe this is the mother of the kids or lesbian lover i don't really know but this is like mexican caitlyn jenner guys come on yay pantene there's also a fantastic dance scene at the end that really caught my attention hi is this just me or do you get like major elderly euphoria vibes with this thing a huge ad agency produced this film and yet like i said i can't find it anywhere except pantene latino america so sadly i don't have any beautiful comments to show you all of this is just a good reminder that these companies aren't producing these films and these ads for normal middle america consumers they're producing this whoa content so that they can get progressive brownie points whatever you want to call it from their colleagues and from like unhinged corporate woke america but if you see any cringe-worthy ads this week send them my way and i might just make this a series i might make you suffer

"welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper yesterday i left you promising that we were gonna talk about kanye today here we go again let's just take a step back i have this stuck in my the kardashians are premiering a new show kanye has a new album coming out pete davidson apparently has a new show coming out they're in the news constantly i personally think that this is like one big kris jenner pr stunt why does everything have to be that chris is such a [\u00a0__\u00a0] in an aspect so what sparks this most recent thing is that kim posted a video of she and north doing this dance like dressed up in a ton of makeup and kanye deemed it inappropriate which started this whole spiral it's now been deleted but i'm just going to show you part of it and this is the trend that's been going around [Music] it's just kind of weird and it's important to point out that that is the first time that they've posted on the kim and north tiktok account in over a month and they stopped because kanye was making a big deal about it was saying i don't want my daughter on there and suddenly they're posting again i think kim's kind of poking the bear but kanye of the video and posted this and said i told y'all before about this tic toc stuff now my eight-year-old on here singing she fell in love with an emo girl leftists don't want fathers to have no say in our children's lives i don't want my kids at godless sierra canyon school i got a voice and i'm not having this and perez hilton you still ain't answer my question and never put my name next to the word abuse don't play with my name like that i'm a real person who wants the best for my children and d.l huley is a pawn yeah i know a king not supposed to address a what is this yeah i know a king not supposed to dress upon but i address everything and find a dress as dl so don't speak on me or my children i can afford to hurt you that doesn't make sense so then he made a long video about fatherhood and how he feels like he isn't able to be involved hey everybody i just got off the phone with cam i told her to stop antagonizing me with this tick tock thing i said it's never again i am her father i know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something i said i'm not allowing my daughter to be used by tick-tock to be used by disney uh i have a say-so okay so the most important part of that video is the beginning where he's saying he's been very vocal with kim about how he does not want north on tick-tock he doesn't want her to be used by disney or anything like that and that's valid and the videos that she posts are i think they're kind of silly but for a kid that has like six million followers and is already going to be in the spotlight for her entire life on a very volatile platform but people are responding to his video in the whole situation and one person said kanye not wanting his daughter on tick tock is kind of normal exactly that has over 100 000 likes so that gives me hope somebody says it's safer for her to be on tick tock than near him until he gets the help he obviously needs have you seen tiktok like the stuff that is on there is horrifying as annoying as kanye is he has every right not to allow his daughter on social media she's actually a child she has no business on these apps yes he can be unhinged and honestly i think he's just trying to protect his kids from social media i agree i don't think that he's caught up in any kind of you know strategy to get pr whatever i think that he genuinely just wants to protect his kids obviously can get a little crazy but he he married into a wild family i don't want a drama but in true kanye fashion he continued to spam instagram with posts and videos all of which have now been deleted obviously but like here's another one i wanted to come to kim's defense in some way about the when when everyone was attacking her about the variety because that's just my heart as a dad my spirit is like just to protect at all costs and i just look at my daughter full makeup singing she's in love with an emo girl on tick-tock and i have no say no approval hey what do you think do you think this would be cool or not yeah i mean and i'm the one that made them cool what a roast but he seems genuine he's like saying could you please just ask me before you post something with my child in it she has all this makeup on all of that aside the biggest news is that there were leaked texts we don't really know if they're real or not between kanye and kim's new boyfriend the infamous pete davidson but pete texts him and is like can you please calm down kim is an amazing mom like you need to chill out and swears a bunch and kanye says oh you're using profanity where are you right now and pete responds in bed with your wife and sends a selfie and the part of this that i noticed and that some other people pointed out is that it looks like pete who's very tatted has a new kim tattoo on his chest which seems very fast but considering the man has a hillary clinton tattoo i wouldn't really trust his judgment anyway it continues and kanye says happy to see you're out of the hospital and rehab and then pete says that it's done wonders for him and that kanye should try and then this is it he says i'm in la for the day if you want to stop being a little internet [\u00a0__\u00a0] boy and talk pete says it's so sad to watch you ruin your legacy on the daily kanye comes back with you're more than welcome to come to sunday's service then pete actually comes back with a real offer we can meet after sunday service we can get food we can talk it out and he's saying what you are doing to your family is dangerous i'm going to scar them for life please handle these matters privately bro i beg of you connie says you want to see me come to sunday service so this is where i get confused because i do semi i can't believe i'm saying this i do semi-respect pete for being like let's actually meet up and talk about it because obviously they have some issues that are separate from the kids and all that thing i don't think pete should be involved with the kids at all that's not his place it's super weird but obviously kanye has beef with him so yeah they can talk it out but it is weird that he posts or he sends a selfie of him in bed with kim and then says let's meet up and then goes into like let me help you with your mental health like he's kind of being crazy too none of this seems sane at all and one guy says kanye ain't that dude and has never been that dude somebody writes back he's from south side chicago i wouldn't doubt him i mean come on kanye and pete davidson one is a noodle the other is a huge man who wears stomping leather boots and black face masks just an intimidating figure i don't think it would work out for pete somebody says kanye basically said find god and left pete on red okay i get this telling someone you're in bed with their wife and then telling them to get mental help is kind of insane and definitely not the way to handle it he isn't the worst person in this situation but this isn't exactly keeping things drama free exactly it just feels like a lot of poking kanye like kim triggered him with this tick tock thing now pete's doing it it's just these people live for the internet's response and i'm feeding into it i admit it every time i watch the batman it's a guaranteed three hours i won't hear the names kanye kim and pete davidson okay the last thing that i'm going to say and this is about p davidson because i just want to really round out the story that i'm telling pete davidson is not only dating kim kardashian not only has a new tv show coming out he will be one of the few people going to space in blue origin's fourth civilian flight i'm fully expecting that in three weeks there's going to be a ton of tick tocks of like pete in space and i just want to prepare you for that because i'm absolutely going to talk about it and i quite honestly am looking forward to it but you know the man's kind of balling yeah i'm uh in staten island in my mom's basement crushing it", "_ZfyfrvpLpU": "welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper there was an article that took twitter by storm over the weekend i thought it was satire or a fake headline so i passed by it the first couple of times it is not this is real i wanted my son to reject masculine stereotypes then he fell in love with tractors all my life i've prided myself on blurring gendered lines but when my young son started to gravitate towards the very things i'd shunned i wasn't sure what to do okay so i thought that we could dive in and just read this together because it's it's just profound so this man's name is jay and he's writing about his son it starts out strong after turning two years old my son avishai started demanding that he only wear tractor shirts and my mind spiraled into darkness i catastrophized worst-case scenarios imagining a world where he fell for everything stereotypically manly i envisioned him on a football field barreling through mega muscled opponents i imagined him waxing a sports car on a warm summer day i have always judged other guys who seemed boxed in by masculinity but three and a half years ago when i became a stay-at-home dad my bias skyrocketed that's literally just the first paragraph he jumps back into his fear of masculinity here i shuddered at jokes about men being incapable of figuring out how to work a diaper yet i felt most couldn't i became even more of an avid stereotyper i grimaced at anyone driving a ford car the john wayne of automobiles i hated men who were plaid god this guy must hate matt walsh felt ill if someone mentioned a wrench or another tool when my mom-in-law bought a v-shy a coverall with footballs on it i shoved it into the depths of his closet never to be found oh god i have to be very honest so my mother did not raise me like non-button like she was not trying to do any of that but she was very cognizant of the fact that she didn't just want me to be surrounded by like pink and princesses and that kind of thing especially because i had three older brothers so i had everything you know available to me but she did steer clear of you know princess and ruffles and that kind of thing i still became you know a ballet dancer and had tutus and that kind of thing she did not have like a crippling fear of little girls who had barbies and princess dresses and she didn't freak out when i you know naturally gravitated to more you know girly things in different parts of my life it was just you know natural she just let me figure it out which i think is probably a good way to go about it because this man is kind of mental so now now we're getting to the good part but then came the tractors it started with youtube on days i was especially drained i'd sit avishai in front of the tv and click on little baby bum he fell in love with the tractor songs and i was so worn i didn't care when he asked to watch clips of construction equipment i mindlessly pressed play but when he demanded the shirts i felt like i failed him i found you i pride myself on blurring gender lines i wanted him to also i had to make a choice buy him clothes with pictures of heavy machinery on them and make the kid happy or force him to wear shirts emblazoned with fuzzy animals to appease me oh no he goes on talking about his family business and more stuff about his father and i just have to read you this line um he ends this paragraph with my body spiraled into panic anytime i attempted manual labor guys did you hear that that was my editor saying beta we're leaving that in any who um when i left for college i swore i'd never hang a picture frame again god this man's hands must be softer than mine wow wow actually i don't think he could because i use nimmy skincare they're a conservative owned skincare brand they're absolutely incredible a lot of their ingredients they source from american farms which is unheard of they're absolutely incredible if you'd like to try them out which i highly suggest you can use this url and then type in code cooper for 15 off of your order they are genuinely incredible and you will not be disappointed what actually disappoints me is that this man said he swore he'd never hang a picture frame again he goes on he says i discovered exactly what i was supposed to be when i became a stay-at-home dad my father covelled me the yiddish word for bursting with pride so like that's nice like i'm all for people you know i'm glad i'm glad that you have found what worked for you that's not what i'm laughing about i am laughing about your genuine horror in traditionally masculine things and it's not i'm not blaming this individual man it is a societal issue that we have propelled by modern feminism where we have painted traditional masculinity to be inherently toxic and awful to have people shy away from it i mean that is why we have so many men like you know timothy chalamet and harry styles that really are these kind of androgynous guys and dresses and that kind of thing they are have now become the ideal men because everybody in this society is so scared of strength and masculinity and oh god manual labor how have we gotten there i swear modern like third way feminism you can quote me on that one of the worst things to ever happen to this country to the west in general honestly oh and there he is again there's jay stay at home dad i am so surprised that he looks like that truly all right guys we're coming to a close although i like to believe that i'm a special guy because i'm a stay-at-home dad who breaks through gender boxes i'm not an anomaly why do all these people think that they're so damn special i don't he continues he says that the number of stay-at-home fathers is on the rise and dads are more involved in child care they see parenting essential to their identity that's great that's actually a very conservative point of view i think we have a major fatherless problem in this country so it is great to see somebody that is so engaged and i think that that is something that we you know desperately need to work on in our society something i've experienced and have you know dealt with and so i get it and i appreciate anytime there is a father that is so involved even though i think that this is a bit wackadoo i had difficulty understanding my son's interest in tractors and at first i tried to nudge avishai towards different videos and clothing but then i remembered how hard it was for my father to trust me to follow my passions and the way we connected after he finally did i took on being an at-home father because i wanted to bond with my son and i realized that it meant i needed to let him discover his own interests he had to define his own identity and not be influenced by my own bias of what i deemed to be too masculine i started taking joy in his joy he radiates wearing his shirts and blazing with diggers and dozers and excavators and at three and a half years old he can name dozens of types of tractors makes up quasi gibberish tractor story sings quasi-gibberish tractor songs and together we clean the living room and he uses his tractors to put all of his toys away sometimes my dad comes over and we drive tiny plastic machinery from room to room my son beams my dad beams and i beam too okay so this ending genuinely is it's nice and i like where he gets with this and the fact that he kind of has gone through this character arc basically and gotten to a point where he is going to be supportive of his son's interest and his passions i think that's fantastic it's just like why was this such an internal struggle and debate to begin with it is so unnecessary and it's so representative of the world that we live in that is so just backwards seeing all of these parents literally freaking out about their children you know a boy being interested in more boy things about girls being interested in girl things and having this whole breakdown about how that is all awful and bigotry and fascism and everything they're kids like i don't know what to tell you let them just be children people in the comments there were some funny ones i want to dive in before we finish this up um like this guy said my daughter likes trucks did i fail as a parent you can ask my mother you guys can commiserate together honestly one of the best days of my life was when my family had moved to idaho and my mom and i got a f-250 it's an incredible truck tractors are a gateway drug next he'll want to dig holes you all see that tweet of last week where some girl was like my boyfriend is digging tunnels in our backyard for fun what does this mean and all the guys in the comments we're like yeah we dig holes and build like things instead of going to therapy add me to the list of thankful town boys who parents saw them playing with truck slash action figures and didn't coerce them into hormone therapy for twitter points yeah this tweet like y'all i wore overalls and i played in the dirt i like my longtime best friend back in la this is true story did not see me wear a dress until i was 16 years old like i remember it i walked into priscilla's coffee shop in burbank california i was wearing this like nice little linen dress i'd gotten and she was like [Music] what the heck it's a true story i want my child to explore their interests but not the ones i like yeah parents like this are the absolute worst like it's an incredibly narcissistic way to raise children and it just goes to show like how ideologically driven they are that they would rather put that above just like the general care and keeping and loving of their children the lesson here is that i think this father is getting it now it took him a bit but he's getting it and so i do urge people to read the entire article because the headline is ridiculous but he actually figured it out so props to him he does seem a bit interesting though so i'm sure he will have other internal struggles like this but hopefully he comes to the same conclusion every time you know live and let live and just love your children do you want to be the only person that is not caught up on the internet's latest chaos i don't think so

yesterday will go down in history books but not for the reason that you might think I mean even Trump predicted it guys on Truth social a couple of days ago but I think he was hoping it would be about him he uh what do you call it when you truth something out you don't tweet it you post it you truth it you truth it I painted my truth well he truest it out and he said hopefully tomorrow will turn out to be one of the most important days in the history of our country but no it was not about trump it was about Taylor freaking Swift but before we get into the story make sure that you guys like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection okay so Taylor Swift announced her newest tour just a couple of weeks ago her new album dropped on the 14th I believe and yesterday pre-sale tickets officially opened up and y'all it was chaotic so a little back story only some of the people got the pre-sale verified fan codes I sadly was not one of them am I bitter slightly but you know what it is okay that was just a whole ordeal in itself this video cracked me up we're just gonna ease you in with some memes here this is live footage of Ticketmaster deciding who does and who does not get pre-sale this is uh Taylor and Ellen who are these people now they're left out no they didn't get chosen that's how life works that was literally me two days ago as I was refreshing my Gmail account being like Taylor I want to go to your door but I digress once people with verified fan pre-sale code got onto Ticketmaster they were put into a waiting room at 10 A.M and they sat for hours and then the website crashed and then they got into the queue where there was a little person walking down a little line and it would be like 2 000 plus people are ahead of you and they waited for hours I mean like 10 hours I saw these tick tocks of girls on college campuses and somebody was like filming from their dorm and they were like walking around with their laptops open so that they didn't refresh the page like people took days off work to buy these tickets and then in the middle of that the website crashed again and in Nashville I don't know if it was just the East Coast or Nashville alone the whole website just stopped working completely but then finally people got into the ticket buying section and they were picking their seats but Ticketmaster didn't prepare enough it was not organized and so for a lot of people once they got into the seat selection there were no seats left it was totally great they couldn't get anything or they would try to check out what the tickets that they had selected and then it would just like flash error and they would be slammed back into the back of the queue God I need to breathe meanwhile the price is on all of these tickets just kept increasing like in this economy imagine sitting there knowing that like okay that might have been 150 at first and now you're about to pay like 800 for Taylor Swift tickets in the pit I mean all of this just makes me happy that I have good ranchers who locks in your price once you subscribe

breasts free with your order and considering how long it's taking everybody to get Taylor Swift tickets you might as well cook some of that steak while you wait in that queue I mean like seriously it went on for the entire day it was wild I would have never anticipated that I would be making an entire episode about this ordeal like when I woke up yesterday I still did not even think that this is going to be a big deal but y'all it was my entire Twitter my entire Tick Tock for you page my whole Instagram literally our office all day as co-workers are walking around with their laptops like am I going to get it am I going to get it people staying late so that they could be on their computer to buy these tickets and you know what there was some political intersection so that is my rationalization of this entire thing somebody tweeted out and said what is Joe Biden's plan to unpause the Ticketmaster queue for Taylor Swift's era tour uh yeah honestly I was hoping that Trump's big announcement was going to be his plan for this I actually tweeted that out to Michael Knowles but another person said Swifty's being radicalized against monopolies and getting ready to do some Anti-Trust lobbying good luck Ticketmaster feral gen Z Taylor Swift fans are coming for that institution AOC also jumped in with that talking point which is the most like weird Wrinkle in this whole timeline she's a daily reminder that Ticketmaster is a monopoly it's merger with Live Nation should have never been approved and they need to be reigned in break them up based on this tweet I'm guessing that you didn't get any tickets either AOC it's okay it's okay I didn't either you and me and the trenches together for once we are actually relating but unlike you I don't call for government intervention anytime something doesn't go my way that is how we differ Tom Elliott responded to her and said it's not a monopoly it's just a shitty company and it's rained not rained and somebody replied and said give her a break she has her bar time Harrison crank replied and said this is one of those rare occurrences where I agree with AOC uh somebody else said the U.S federal government is a monopoly it needs to be reined in break it up that's the real tweet I'll frame that I'll put that up on my wall okay now this next comment that I'm reading is wild it actually requires a bit more context I think so as you all probably know by now yesterday missiles were fired into Poland and they ended up killing two people and initially Ukraine said that it was Russia but now it looks like it was actually Ukrainian missiles and I don't really want to get into the whole geopolitical you know Foreign Affairs of why it was blamed on Russia I'm guessing that it was because Poland is in NATO and I automatically thought of the NATO treaties Article 5 which states I have it here uh that the countries agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all trying to rope in some NATO support trying to get us more involved I mean it is very serious I don't often talk about Foreign Affairs here so I'll defer to others on this topic but world leaders immediately kicked into high gear when they thought it was Russia I mean if you think we are already too involved in this conflict whether it be physically or financially a buckle up because they are not slowing down but anyway back to Taylor Swift and AOC and how this relates to Ukraine and Russia this person said AOC NATO just got bombed and you tweet this our federal politicians everyone really caring about the big issues I mean it really is our culture in general though because the entirety of yesterday number one trending in pop culture was Ticketmaster and then the Grammy Award nominations and then way down there in politics was then Poland and Russia and maybe World War III trended for a bit and then it went away but you know what saved the entire day Taylor Swift Ticketmaster the entire day and it was wild I mean I was trying to figure out how I wanted to wrap up this segment and I think it really comes down to this yesterday Donald Trump was slated to make a huge announcement that I felt like my entire world was talking about obviously apparently did not make much of an impact outside of my little sphere world leaders were meeting about a NATO attack that could pull all of us into World War III any day now and you know what the majority of people especially in my generation were thinking about Taylor Swift and getting tour tickets and rallying against the authoritarian Monopoly that is Ticketmaster now obviously we can [\u00a0__\u00a0] about that we can say that these people need to wake up there are bigger things going on in the world these people are just plain stupid you know we we should because they are but we also need to adapt because obviously the cultural things that is what this generation cares about and if we do not lean into that we're going to lose thank you for watching the comment section if you want to see more videos just like this make sure to subscribe to this

"welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper you know as I was putting together this segment and you know looking and researching this story I realized I really have not talked about Biden much recently like I think maybe the last episode I did about him was him falling off the bike which honestly was probably the most exciting thing that he has done as of late I feel like old Joe has been just taking a nap staying in his bunker I've talked about his policies but I really have not talked about him and things that he has been saying but now he is back apparently just in time for the midterms and in quintessential Biden fashion he is giving us some glorious puff pieces and answering softball questions for some kiss ass Legacy Media but I actually in this 60 Minutes interview I found something that I can sort of agree with bidenons we're going to talk about that but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection all right I don't need to give this video an introduction let's just watch Mr President first Detroit Auto show in three years yeah is the pandemic over the pandemic is over we still have a problem with covet we're still doing a lot of work on it uh it's but the pandemic is over if you notice no one's wearing masks everybody seems to be in pretty good shape and so I think it's changing and I think this is a perfect example now all in all the 60 Minutes interview was an absolute train wreck like if Biden looked like death so I hope that he has used epic will to get his Affairs in order epic will is a fantastic sponsor of mine and they give you the easiest and most efficient way to secure

private jet when he walks across that little red carpet he still will be putting on his n95 probably with the help of Jill because he is confusing I also love that later in the interview there were people behind him wearing masks like in the background like dude you're not that slick but you know what to be positive I agree with Biden on something the pandemic is over even though we have literally been saying that since 2020 the two weeks to slow the spread I came out of that and I was like you know what I'm done this is not it I don't need to care anymore somebody said if the pandemic is over how is Biden claiming that it's an emergency that requires student loan forgiveness people still need our help we gotta forgive the student loans covet is still raging they can't pay give me a break other person said so if the scandemic is over why did New York just fire 860 more teachers for not getting the vacs and why can nurses still not get jobs if they do not take this experimental vaccine if the pandemic is over does not add up somebody said we said this like a year and a half ago but okay yeah exactly most people with common sense and any kind of balls woke up years ago and realized that they did not need the government's permission to leave their house and live their lives of course there were people who were still scared shitless about the entire thing like most people in the comments were going okay yeah what's new we get it but these people obviously had to come through the Woodworks like somebody replied and said the World Health Organization said that the end is in sight so we're close but not a hundred percent there yet I'm still gonna hide in my house okay somebody else said why did Scott Pelley push back on literally everything but this the pandemic is not over and the reason so many people aren't wearing masks is precisely because of this kind of gaslighting and propaganda well I'm glad that you realize that the media does engage in gaslighting and propaganda but I think you're looking at the wrong thing my friend somebody replied to her and said he could have exclaimed about progress and urged people to get vaccinated to continue the progress what a colossal error darn nobody cares at all even 60 Minutes I thought the comments like that would be in the minority but then I woke up this morning and I saw that there was a new hashtag trending like at the top of the trending page with a nice bulky paragraph explaining what it's about so you know when it looks like that the Twitter has had a hand in elevating it so that everybody knows the propaganda the hashtag is covet is not over like they literally wasted no time in elevating that these are the types of tweets that are under this despicable hashtag somebody said dear Progressive politicians that was your moment you called out disinformation with Trump keep that up for Biden's disinformation with covid right now hashtag covet is not over and I want to see the politicians who represent me demanding that the Public Health Care system take care of us like Sabrina we get that you wear a mask alone in your car you don't need to write this entire tweet to defend it we're aware another person said I thought when the CDC said that those who are vaccinated can remove their masks was the worst statement but Biden saying the pandemic over just topped that by a mile #kova does not over hashtag covet is Airborne you people cannot give up the ACT my mom once said that these people are so desperate to cling onto this narrative because they know that they got friend like they believed that if they got vaccinated they could take off their masks and that they would not get sick suddenly they are still getting covered so now they are believing that they have to take every booster so they won't get sick news flash you probably are still going to get sick and now they are so desperate to shove it down our throats so that we don't realize that everybody got cooked and honestly I think the Diane is right about that one somebody else said coveted pandemic is not over in fact this fall and winter may be the worst yet for covet in the U.S hashtag covet is not over oh my God are we facing another winter of death and despair I can't believe we're starting it over again like dude leave your house nobody cares somebody else said nobody wants lockdowns or to have to mask forever but if we do not do something to slow covid right now we will do damage to a society to a point that simple preemptive Solutions won't be able to fix hashtag Covetous Airborne mask up hashtag code is not over hashtag covid-19 hashtag covid-19 hashtag Monday thank you for your Monday morning thoughts my friend you are clearly just cheering me up I woke up on the right side of the bed but now I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the bed these people are just asking to be controlled by the government they cannot think outside of this one little crisis bubble I mean it's literally like these people are crying out like govern Me Harder baby like what what you want the government to have more control over you have you learned anything in the last two years it truly kills me that we live amongst people like that well actually we probably don't because they're still locked up in their home so I probably never have to interact with them which is better for me but honestly people anybody who was tweeting under this kovid is not over hashtag get a life get a grip no one cares you are the only one causing these problems for yourself the sooner that you realize that you have autonomy over your life and your decisions and your health you will be a lot happier I am just saying Daddy Biden does not need to tell you when it is safe to leave your house but bringing it back to the 60 Minutes interview kovid was not the only thing that Biden talked about and I just want to leave you on one last Biden note because this video is going around the internet right now and it is just like too ridiculous not to share because in typical Biden fashion Biden's got a Biden he's got a gaff he's gotta make us all laugh that was like disgusting rhyming that I did not intend to do I sincerely apologize for that but this is probably my favorite moment from the entire interview Mr President you are the oldest president ever pretty good shape huh which leads to my next question you are more aware of this than anyone some people ask whether you are fit for the job more than half of the country I wonder what you think watch me honest to God that's all I think watch me if you think I don't have the energy level of mental acuity then then you know that's one thing that's another thing if just watching and you know keep my schedule do what I'm doing I I think that uh you know I don't want to sit down with our NATO allies and keep them together I don't have them saying wait a minute how old are you what do you what they say I think they're asking what did you say because you're mumbling and you're talking like that that's not a positive question that's like how old are you like you can't even speak dude all right sorry we have to continue that old expression the proof of the puddings and the eating I mean I I respect the fact that people would say you know you're old and but I think it relates to how much energy you have and whether or not the job you're doing is one consistent with what any person of any age would be able to do how would you say your mental focus is oh it's focused I say it's I think it's I I haven't look I literally can't even say focus on one mentioning one time I've been saying to myself my own head the number of years I know more think of myself as being as old as I am than fly I mean it's just not uh I haven't observed anything in terms of there's not things I don't do now that I did before whether it's physical or mental or anything else he is literally trying to convince us all that he has never been sharper that he is he is so honored I'm so focused with his like weird eyes in his teeth he literally cannot continue a train of thought as he is trying to convince us of this fact he goes on like four different tangents in 20 seconds like I genuinely feel kind of bad for Biden because he is clearly a puppet being propped up by Elite Democrats who are just using him as a pawn in their political agenda I don't know if he knows that anything is going on he is too busy thinking about pudding and trucky chalky chip ice cream to actually know that any of that is happening chocolate chip but hey at least coven is over and the proof of the pudding is in the eating guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this Channel and ring that Bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "KtlpyODZBvg": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper so as i'm sure you're all well aware by now johnny depp and his ex-wife amber heard are in the midst of a messy and very public defamation trial so as a bit of backstory uh amber heard and johnny depp were married i think they divorced in 2017 but amber for years has accused johnny depp of domestic abuse she wrote exposes about their relationship she absolutely destroyed his career and his reputation this has been going on for a while but it has long been speculated that amber was actually the one who was abusive but this was all happening at the height of the you know hashtag metoo movement and the believe all women no matter what moment in time so very few people actually took those accusations seriously they claimed that a man couldn't be a victim that amber was too nice that she was too small to hit johnny depp and all of that stuff but finally everything is coming out into the open about their relationship and it is wild so johnny is suing amber for defamation because of the expose that she has written i think like 50 million dollars is on the line that's a lot of money there's a lot happening it's not just the case and the details of their chaotic marriage that is wild the actual trial and court proceedings are just a hot mess and johnny especially has been giving us incredible content so i thought that we could react to a few of my favorite moments thus far and if you're looking for an in-depth analysis of what's been going on in the trial you want to be kept up to date we have some daily wire videos about that you can go check that out but today this is just going to be funny clips we're going to laugh it's going to be a good time so jumping in this is a compilation of johnny's reactions during amber heard's lawyer's opening statement okay so here's this first one where amber heard's lawyer accuses him of being a drug addict that's the list of medications he takes in one day that they prescribe that doesn't include the cocaine it doesn't include the ecstasy the mdma the money it's during these rages that mr depp engaged in she was taking extras she was doing anything she could to make money to survive and then you know what she did with it she gave a bunch of gifts he is so unbothered it's fantastic and obviously like this creator is putting these captions on there but it just makes it okay so here she's talking about where johnny allegedly pushed amber into the carpet he haven't slapped her now you see the rings that mr depp has on him hurts when he slaps and she was stunned she had no idea what to think hit her again and this time it knocked her right off the sofa under the ground and she remembers her face was in this dirty filthy carpet that's what she remembers and fixated bombs look at his face the person from a [\u00a0__\u00a0] don't insult my carpet like just take a look at his facial expressions as she's talking about all of this utter [\u00a0__\u00a0] and he's like i did what all right this last one from this little compilation this is as the lawyer is closing up her remarks and just watch it's just just look at this the next day she and her friends went to coachella but his housekeeper had come in to clean after that always did um and the housekeeper found some you know feces on the bed um and had been upset about it and taken a picture and sent it to him so all dog even though they got two dogs and one of them has major problems you'll hear about boo and pistol um and and somehow amber was doing this so he would like uh okay so we're looking at johnny's face because we also talk about this lawyer who looks like she's like playing charades the whole time like okay we gotta go back to this and then this happened i mean he's so over it it's great okay also you probably heard in that little tidbit right there her talking about fecal matter we're gonna get to that in a moment don't worry that's important uh other people are pointing out how bad this lawyer is somebody said my god this woman is an actual liar it sounds like she's telling me some crazy story somebody else says amber's lawyer sounds like she's making up the opening statement as she goes just as for johnny someone else says can this lady put my kids to sleep with her great storytelling skills i think that this woman was only part of the trial for like the first week and now she's been nowhere to be seen some people think that she quit or maybe was fired in my mind i would like to think that she quit because she was like i can't keep making up these stories because this is utter bs that's my fantasy but who knows we'll see what actually happens now we have to get back to the poop that's the really important part of this whole episode um the bit where the liar references somebody pooping in the bed that was amber when johnny finally left when they were when he finally left he was going to divorce her she pooped on his side of the bed and then took a picture of it and sent it to him as an fu gross psychopath behavior like in what world are you like this is gonna get back at my ex why are the pretty ones always insane okay also most of these clips have been about johnny just because that's my personal favorite but have you guys noticed that amber heard looks like she has been put through the ringer and i know that that's got to be a tactic because everything in these trials like down to what they wear is like specified but like the woman looks tired she's not wearing any makeup she just looks exhausted honestly she looks like she needs some nimmy skin care which is my favorite skincare brand nimmy is the only conservative owned skincare brand a lot of their ingredients come from american farms which is incredible i have my whole routine is nimmy i use their cleanser their toner all of their hydrating moisturizers genuinely the stuff is incredible and i have very sensitive skin so i promise you you can trust it and for my boys out there don't roll your eyes at me because mother's day is coming up treat your mother she deserves it and boys using a little moisturizer from time to time it won't kill you so go to this url use code cooper and get 15 off of your nimmy skincare order here is him talking about it it's just it's too good this is him explaining it and then he showed me a photograph it was a it was a it was a photograph of the bed our bed um and on my side of the bed was human fecal matter so i understood why and just take a look at his face and he's like my god what has my life become i'm sitting here trying to testify about poop my initial response to that was i mean i laughed it was so outside it was so bizarre and so grotesque that i could only laugh okay so then this next part apparently amber and these lawyers are trying to blame it on the dogs she brought up the situation of the her fecal matter on the bed uh and she just tried to blame it on the dogs why didn't you think it could have been the dogs they're teacup yorkies they weigh about four pounds each he's trying to find like a classy way to say that it was just a huge tiny teacup yorkies could not produce like he could have just said she shut the bed and she sent a picture to me but no he like he painted the scene i just can't get over that clip someone said um i love how heavily implied it is that the sh was just too monstrous to be done by four pound puffs i think at this point the dogs are going to need to file a lawsuit against amber as well for damaging their reputation and being blamed for voting you pooped in the refrigerator defamation for defecation that was good all right that was great thank you guys and said this trial is literally therapy for every guy who has dated a woman who dragged him when she was clearly the problem how could amber's liars even defend her after this i would love to be in the room as they're you know doing their depositions and that kind of thing and they're hearing the things that she's done and it's like oh my god what have i gotten myself into this is another clip from a compilation this is amber's new liar not the lady questioning johnny about articles that were written about him and just you have to watch johnny's patience just start to wear thin johnny depp reportedly drank heavily and was constantly late on the new pirates movie set did i read that right you did reportedly the next article will also be made mr depp please just respond to the question that i'm asking you the next question the next the next document yes is entitled johnny depp's financial woes might sink the next pirates of the caribbean did i read that right you you did i don't know his patience was wearing so thin may 25th 2007 johnny depp's star power looks as wobbly as jack sparrow on a plank did i read that right you read that very very well the next one hollywood reporter you may kill me but you might never insult me oh let's go back a bit we have to see the people in the gallery look at look whatever what is this group of people here who are they are they just local virginians that want to come hang out this is huge june 21st 2015 six months before the inside the trials of johnny depp did i read that right you did you should read the article and the last one the last one no further questions all right ladies and gentlemen i love that he says at the end no further questions when he didn't ask johnny a single question somebody says the way in which he conducts himself is just incredible and humorous to say the least can't get over the way he says yes mr rottenborn you can just see it in his eyes and hear in the tone of his voice and he can't believe that that guy's last name is what it is okay now this is the last one i thought that that video was the final one no i have one more this is amber's lawyer mr rottenborn everybody's favorite accidentally objecting to his own question you didn't know what could cause damage to mr depp's hand while you were there on march 8th correct dr kepler told me he sustained an injury on one of his weight rejection here's hearsay you asked the question okay okay you said it's stained sustained an injury to his finger yes you can't see johnny in this johnny is over on this little side where it's cut off on the lawn crime channel but i have another i have his point of view right here uh rejection here's hearsay you asked the question okay okay it's like so brief but the fact that we get to see like this lighter side of johnny and this like release basically literally after years of people hating him and calling him an abuser and his career genuinely being destroyed being kicked off of movies everything it's just the most beautiful redemption story and especially as this thing is just a cluster it is am i wrong i'm not that actually made me think like watching all of these do you guys know the uh the hot crazy matrix scale i was thinking about that in regards to amber heard the pooping in the bed and some of the other like lies that she made up and that kind of thing like what must be going through his head with like how did i end up with this girl so that's what reminded me of the hot crazy matrix my team is all men my editors and my producers so i felt like i needed to ask do you where does she fall on the hot crazy matrix uh definitely tan scale crazy because there's danger and then there's no go this is the danger zone for sure 100 she has a wild dating history too did you guys know that she was dating cara delevingne for a bit i don't know i really don't care the only person that i care about that she's dated other than johnny depp is elon musk and he's supposed to testify adam very excited about we're going to have an episode about that there's also an interesting extra storyline there because apparently johnny depp is like obsessed with elon musk so i just think that it could be a very cool dynamic like i enjoy joking about this and it's funny to see all the memes and that kind of thing but it's just slightly odd how it's become such a spectacle this whole trial has because i mean johnny depp lost his career he lost his family he lost everything his life imploded and now we're sitting around watching all of this transpire basically hoping that it turns into a movie or an o.j simpson you know style miniseries like we are this is basically reality tv and it just makes you think like this is all manufactured like they are absolutely controlling what we know and what we care about like like the maxwell trial that happened earlier this year that was not recorded was not publicized barely anything in mainstream media covered it but epstein's right-hand man was found guilty of sex trafficking have we talked about it no that was not publicized and then were any of the celebrities or elites who were involved actually brought forward and named no absolutely not it was all swept under the rug because they don't want us knowing about it but this they're fine with it it's a distraction and i mean i'm falling prey to it i'm literally making a video about it but it's important to at least be aware of that and no like they know what they're doing it's just food for thought guys whoa whoa guys i cannot believe you're about to leave this video without liking it first it's honestly kind of rude be better", "v8zVfboFDfI": "you think that you have the best show on daily wire you all are about to see the real Brett

that notification Bell so that you never miss a single comment section or off the clock episode we are putting out new content every day sometimes twice a day and even on weekends now and I don't want you to miss a thing", "a8YiM3mcbjI": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I am here with a Balenciaga 2.0 episode because I thought that maybe this would all settle it is not it has only gotten Wilder which you know after eight or nine months of doing the show I should expect now that these stories only get crazier as they go on so we're back because we have updates but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and if you want even more content you can follow me on Twitter and on Instagram at I'm Brett Cooper I did multiple updates on the first Balenciaga Story one was literally from my car because they kept doing new apologies their first apology wasn't good enough because they basically said we're sorry that you got offended by our art we're sorry that it rubbed you the wrong way and then they came back with a second apology talking about the Supreme Court cases about child pornography that were under some of their products and they said okay actually this is kind of a big deal we're gonna pursue legal action now they have come back with yet a third statement we would like to address the controversy surrounding our recent ad campaigns we strongly condemn child abuse it was never our intent to include it in our narrative the two separate ad campaigns in question reflect a series of Grievous errors for which Balenciaga takes responsibility that's the other thing there was a holiday campaign and then there was the spring 2023 release campaign they both had these child pornographic child abuse children with Kink Bears undertones that doesn't just oopsie Daisy happen there has to be something Brewing under the surface that is causing this and that is going to be the through line for this whole episode but anyway we didn't we didn't know it was going to happen you're one of the biggest fashion houses out there and you didn't have anybody look over your ad campaigns you didn't have anybody look at it you didn't have legal okay anyway moving on the first campaign the gift collection campaign featured children with plush bear bags dressed in what some have labeled BDSM inspired outfits are plush bear bags in the gift collection should not have been featured with children this was a wrong choice by Balenciaga combined with our failure and assessing and validating images the responsibility for this lies with Balenciaga alone what some have labeled as BDSM inspired it literally is you have the Bears in bondage if you're owning up to it completely own up to it I'm not saying you can't make whatever clothes you want to make or whatever bags and accessories I'm just saying keep children out of it that's like the Baseline thing that all of us are asking that is the bare minimum Drawing the Line in the Sand the second separate campaign for spring 2023 which was meant to replicate a business office environment included a photo with a page in the background from a Supreme Court ruling United States versus Williams 2008 which confirms as illegal and not protected by freedom of speech the promotion of child pornography all the items included in shooting were provided by Third parties that confirmed in writing that these props were fake office documents they turned out to be real legal papers most likely coming from the filming of a television drama really that's what you're gonna say oh we just happened to get these papers from some random television drama that happened to be talking about child pornography that happened to have those Supreme Court cases laying around on the table that's a bit fishy just a tad bit they go on and they say the inclusion of these unapproved documents was the result of Reckless negligence for which Balenciaga has filed a complaint we take full accountability for our lack of oversight and control of the documents in the background and we could have done things differently while internal and external investigations are ongoing we are taking the following actions we are closely revising our organization and Collective ways of working we are reinforcing the structures around our creative processes and validation tips we want to ensure that new controls Mark a pivot and will prevent this from happening again we are letting the groundwork with organizations who specialize in child protection and aims at ending child abuse and exploitation we want to learn from our mistakes to identify ways that we can contribute Balenciaga reiterates its sincere apologies for the offense we have caused and extends its apologies to talents and partners I can't believe that they had to do three of those apologies in order to barely get it right and actually take responsibility it's the bare minimum but you did it Balenciaga deleted everything from their page they had originally deleted all the campaigns and then they quietly reposted them and then they deleted them again when they were doing all their apologies so now this statement is the only thing on their page but they also changed all of their highlights the little like bubbles on Instagram not to show off their collections or their designs they have only put up their social justice Warrior posts basically to prove that they are holier than thou that even though they messed up here we we really we are loving intolerant we are like look at these women's rights here we go Balenciaga believes in the fundamental human right of choice the choice to make the best decision for your body and health therefore in light of recent Decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States we will extend our health care benefits to include coverage for travel costs to other states for U.S employees who live in areas that restrict reproductive care here's another one United 24 valenciaga supports the United 24 platform for helping refugees this is for Ukraine here's some other one this is diversity and inclusion Balenciaga is committed to standing Against Racism and creating inclusive communities apparently very inclusive for children in a very creepy Way We are continuing a long-term partnership with the NAACP through annual donations and on May 25th encouraging our community to learn more about the continual work that they do to disrupt inequality dismantle racism and accelerate change you've got to do better Senator valenciaga supports outright action International's mission to Advocate with and on behalf of people who experience discrimination and abuse based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity expression with recognized consultative status at the United Nations outright builds capacity for lgbtqi LGBT IQ movements documents human rights violations and advocates for inclusion and equality and holds leaders accountable for protecting the rights of people everywhere that's so confusing can you guys at least just get the letters in like a standard thing I'm used to the lgbtq like IA plus but now I'm doing LGBT IQ I don't understand anyway people everywhere that's basically it they're basically saying please ignore our child pornography references and our Kink purses because look at how politically correct we have always been look we're supporting everybody we want to like get our employees abortions we we hate racism we can't be that bad no you definitely can be that bad because apparently you are run by Freaks now there are many celebrities closely tied to Balenciaga and these campaigns for instance Bella Hadid and Nicole Kidman were both models in the 2023 spring collection neither of them have made statements Nicole Kidman has left up her posts about Balenciaga like ladies I get the economy is crazy right now you don't want to lose a buck but at least have some morals and if you want to save money you can go buy good ranchers because due to a shrinking herd beef prices are expected to rise another 15 in 2023 and that is not even taking inflation into account that is why I subscribe to good ranchers because they will inflation proof your grocery bill by locking in your price for the lifetime of your good Rancher subscription and if that is not enough to convince you you can save even more money using my code Cooper which will get you two 12 ounce Black Angus New York strip steaks and two non-pasteurized chicken breasts free with your order if you use code Cooper so go to goodranchers.com and use code Cooper at checkout for that offer again that is goodranchers.com code Cooper at checkout for the special offer because while you can't control the crazy things that celebrities do or this economy at least you can take control of your grocery bill Kim Kardashian is also very closely tied to Balenciaga Candace has been talking about this a lot on her podcast even publicly asked Kim for a statement because Kim and Kanye both have worked with Balenciaga they wear Balenciaga all the time they both have lines of Balenciaga and after six days she finally posted this Twitter thread I've been quiet for the past few days not because I haven't been disgusted and outraged by the recent Balenciaga campaigns but because I wanted an opportunity to speak to their team to understand for myself how this could have happened as a mother of four I have been shaken by the disturbing images the safety of our children must be held with the highest regard and any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society period I appreciate balenciaga's removal of the campaigns and their apology in speaking with them I believe that they understand the seriousness of the issue and will take necessary measures for this to never happen again as for my future with Balenciaga I am currently reevaluating my relationship with the brand basing it off of their willingness to accept accountability for something that should have never happened to begin with and the actions I'm expecting to see them to take to protect children the apology tours they drain me in Reading their statement you can obviously tell that it is not truly authentic or Genuine you don't even have to read between the lines to see that but they are following the template whether you are a brand or a celebrity that has had attempted cancellation whether you actually did something wrong or with some ridiculous political thing they all say the same thing and it's tiresome and I hate it I want to see actual action from these people not just the same apology to her over and over again but I mean guys is this surprising like she is best friends with her creative director denma he put her and Kanye in all of those weird like fully blacked out masks all of the weird stuff also that's kind of tied to something that was also in that Balenciaga campaign there's a book in there It Is by a German artist and it has children in all of these like weird masked like black cloaks that sort of stuff that's his influence that is his inspiration they are very very tight he has worked with her on all of her collaborations and she has not shied away from having her and Kanye's kids and outfits that are very similar somebody tweeted this and said people really expected Kim Kardashian to condemn Balenciaga when she let them put nine-year-old Northwest in a [\u00a0__\u00a0] mask for Fashion Week last month here is her nine-year-old child in some weird BDSM looking black mask freaky stuff and guys she posted this on Tick Tock with her daughter North last week after this Scandal had erupted look at this she is wearing Balenciaga and just listen to the words of the song they are wearing Balenciaga dancing to a song that says I don't care why would you post this knowing that the brand you work most closely with is being accused of child abuse and child pornography and pedophilia do you have no brain cells or are you really just fine with everything that is going on we also need to go back and talk about her friend denma now he took over balenciaga's creative Direction in 2015 and saying that it has gone downhill since then it's putting it mildly I mean they did this gross [\u00a0__\u00a0] in Paris fashion week which I've talked about many times before this was only a couple of months ago but even weirder here is a video that denma proudly posted on his Instagram it's a fake baby doll or fake baby in like bloody Rags what is the purpose oh God like why why do they have fake babies and bags with bloody baby items and diapers and pacifiers you are an adult clothing brand you're trying to be edgy you're trying to put all of these sexual things you're trying to be muddy and dark and whatever why are you including babies also controversy surrounding one of the primary stylists that denma brought on to work with Balenciaga her name is Lada volkova and her Instagram is just totally weird she's now privatized it but it is full of fake babies bondage and teddy bears does that sound familiar to any campaigns that we have seen recently possibly she has not been explicitly named as part of the creative team for either of these campaigns but she at least had some influence there here she is this was just in September she's weirdly holding this teddy bear here's another one in some sort of rope hanging teddy bear here are two people in trash bags kissing hugging and she like put a bunch of Hearts there's another one here's a baby holding up a skull very very weird stuff like the rabbit hole just keeps getting deeper and Balenciaga is desperately trying to prove that this is all external it was the contracted set designer it was the photographer it was the advertising agency we didn't know we had no idea and people in the media looking into it also don't want to address it directly I mean just look at how the view is discussing it I found this ad campaign particularly distasteful in this moment so there's this there's growing anti-lgbtq sentiment right now and how it's Being Framed is as portraying you know trans people as groomers this is a term you'll hear on the far right they're groomers this is where you get the anti-drag queen stuff that we're seeing so Balenciaga played right into their hands by having kids in a sexualized manner carrying something that represents you know sex acts I think it was a really bad misstep at a moment where it's just kind of a dangerous time to even give Credence to those kind of insane takes I'm sorry what this was just a bad time this was a bad time for children in sex Kink teddy bears this just was not opportunity you're playing directly into the hands of the far right it is not the far right it is people with common sense and decency who actually want to protect children that are saying something is wrong in this Society including what Balenciaga is doing Balenciaga is not playing into the far right they are just an example of what we talk about every single day this is grotesque also the fact that she just it's kind of distasteful no it's not just distasteful it's disgusting be honest this kind of campaign doesn't just pop out of nowhere and accidentally land on the internet this has to have been brewing in this company you can't just blame balenciaga's hires they are the ones who hired those freaks you have to set a tone in a company for this to happen so just blaming it on oh the Ad Agency the set designer that does nothing it also just goes to show that they will not discuss something in the news they will not discuss a cultural Trend if it is not advantageous to their side pedophilia child abuse The Grooming of children that has sadly become a right-wing talking point the left doesn't want to get into it they say that we're creating it that we're making it up so when there is an egregious act against children they won't even touch it because it's not on their side that just shows you how they have no principles to stand on they have no consistency everything is political to them and then to make this even broader all of this has been enabled by our perverted hypersexualized society and if you can't even admit that you're probably part of the problem okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "FaygiFx-Jq0": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I think this is my third episode in a row where we have been talking about Hollywood and about entertainment which I actually love because it is my favorite thing to discuss but today we are talking about the new Tim Burton TV show Wednesday it is based on The Adams Family it is a new reimagined Adams Family Universe Riverdale meets Adam's family I think is the best way that I can describe it but it is also racist apparently but before we get into it make sure you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring that notification Bell and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter at I'm Brett Cooper here is the New York Post article that first broke this story this is actually from last week but I only really started seeing people defending it and getting upset about it a couple of days ago over the weekend Tim Burton's Wednesday called races for casting black actors as bullies that makes no sense whatsoever here's the trailer just so you guys can get a taste if you have not seen the show it's fully on Netflix now so you might have already watched all of it it looks like a cool show I have no idea whether it is woke or not I like Jenna Ortega I've seen her Disney stuff I know what she's been in she's cool I like I said I love The Adams Family I watched the entire Adams Family like black and white series I saw the Broadway musical when it was running more times than I would like to admit because I love it so much I would probably watch this if I had Netflix maybe I will actually get Netflix so that I can watch it because it does look arguably very cool now people are claiming that this show is racist because two of the bullies at Wednesday's new school Nevermore Academy are black and according to the woe critics the only people who can be flawed mean or maybe even complex are white I guess and I say complex because spoiler alert just you know as the story progresses these black characters end up having this like huge character Arc according to people who are doing analysis is the show and it's more of a hurt people hurt people type situation rather than them just being like objectively mean bullies and at the end they end up like teaming up with Wednesday to take down the actual villain who is white so really this doesn't seem racist it just seems like people want something to [\u00a0__\u00a0] and moan about which is very very normal because they just want to create problems in their own lives so they can feel good about being victims like I feel like these people should be happy that Tim Burton is leading a show where people of color are not just shoved into some cookie cutter remake but they actually have Rich character arcs and they have layers and they're complex like guys it is not that complicated it's not like you're trying to buy a car or something I mean if you are trying to buy a car carzin keeps it from being that complicated because buying a car is a stressful experience for everyone especially if you are a first-time buyer or have no credit that is where my new partners at carzane come into play carzing puts the power back in your hands and make sure that you have all the information you need

simplified because I spend my life working through ridiculous stories like this where social justice Warriors over complicate all of these situations and create problems where there are not problems I mean just like listen to them Squawk on Twitter one person says Tim Burton owes me an apology for making all four of the black people in this show look crazy somebody else said don't get me wrong I love Jenna Ortega and that she's playing Wednesday but one thing I hate about this show is that why did they make all the black people in the show terrible people like how did Netflix see nothing wrong with this I hate Tim Burton's racist self somebody else said why is the black girl in Wednesday school an aggressive bully though Tim Burton is a known racist no surprises there somebody else said Tim Burton cast black people finally and then makes them into Pilgrim villains y'all can't tell me that man isn't insufferable and racist as hell in real life somebody else tweeted and said in my opinion the character choices of making a black woman the villain in Wednesday wasn't racist but Tim Burton is three thousand percent a racist piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] and both of those sentences can't stand together also just speaking about Jenna Ortega she is not white the leading actress is a person of color she is Mexican and Puerto Rican so this is not just about wanting minorities in Tim Burton TV shows they are just upset about the portrayal of these like two black characters so then I just started noticing comments about Tim Burton's widespread racism and I had no idea what that was about but somebody was saying like has everyone just decided to ignore the fact that Tim Burton is racist somebody else said Tim Burton has been racist for a long time and I can't stand watching any of his work anymore it just feels wrong somebody else said that me watching Wednesday why are only four black people so far three of them are [\u00a0__\u00a0] credits directed by Tim Burton me ah I what I mean I don't understand and on top of that her father Gomez Adams is also now a Puerto Rican and he used to be this white character they are not whitewashing Adam's family they're actually making it more diverse why are you so upset it seems like they are only upset about the portrayal of these like four black characters which really is not that big of a deal the tweets about Tim Burton's racist self just go on and on I really don't know a ton about Tim Burton I watched some of his movies when I was younger and they really weirded me out so I have not watched any since then the show actually does look cool so maybe I should watch it and give him a second chance but I've just never been the biggest fan of him so I don't really pay attention I don't know anything about him but apparently people despise him and despise his movies so I did some research and I saw that back in 2016 when his film Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children came out he made some comments about diversity quotas after he was accused of having mostly white casts by his leading actor Samuel L Jackson Who apparently said oh I think I'm like the first black leading character in a Tim Burton film and so in response Tim Burton gave this statement to bustle in an interview nowadays people are talking about it more he says regarding film diversity but things either call for things or they don't I remember back when I was a child watching The Brady Bunch and they started to get all politically correct I actually love The Brady Bunch that was another show I used to watch okay let's have a Nation child and a black and I used to get more offended by that than jazz just like I grew up watching black exploitation movies right and I said that's great I didn't go like oh there should be more white people in these movies So based on this it seems like Tim Burton is just an old school Storyteller where he's casting People based on Merit and based on what the actual story calls for rather than what is politically correct would be advantageous for him in the political diversity quotas realm and I mean he's in his 60s so like he said in this statement he has watched all of this transpire I'm sure he's fed up with it he doesn't want to feed into this modern nonsense and I love it like maybe Tim Burton is based the fact that he is willing to say no go kick rocks I'm gonna do what I want I really admire that it's the same thing when I was talking about the lead singer from the 1975. he is not conservative I don't even think he's on the right but he is willing to be politically incorrect for the sake of his art for the sake of his authenticity that is what we are missing in Hollywood that is what we are missing in entertainment and art and storytelling as a whole so I admire this and maybe now I'm gonna go watch a whole bunch of Tim Burton things but anyway I appreciate the fact that he just does not give a crap his team also does not care the New York Post reached out for comment about this article they were writing and about the you know racist accusations his representative said quote I'm not forwarding a comment request this is silly to Tim said Mike Simpson of William Morris Endeavors however apparently daylight savings time is racist he added linking a recent CNN article that argued that Daylight Savings Time disproportionately affects the sleep and health of minority communities quote Wednesday was shot in Romania where daylight savings time is observed maybe that's a better angle mic drop based not only did they say this is ridiculous these claims are absurd it doesn't even match up with the story but they went so far to say this woke [\u00a0__\u00a0] give it up we don't care you're ridiculous literally throwing something back into your post's face I'd love to see it thankfully though Tim Burton and his team are not the only people with common sense here because in the middle of all of those tweets about how racist he and that TV show are they were people that were saying no you are absurd this person tweeted out and said apparently it is now racist to have black people in fictional films and TV shows playing bullies what's next depicting black people as gang members and thugs shooting each other in City these like Chicago is going to be racist too somebody else said whoever thinks Wednesday is racist is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] racist ain't nobody thought of it like that until you all started cooking [\u00a0__\u00a0] through your brains get a grip everything it always about racism also every bully I've experienced was white just saying this guy even thinks the white people are bullies but he realizes that this is absurd last comment somebody said so apparently Wednesday spit off to Adam's family is somehow racist because they cast people of color in the role of some bullies and I just gotta Wonder to all the people tweeting and writing articles along those lines do you only think that white kids are capable of bullying I guess I get the context in which a lot of those people are freaking out because you know these days guys every bully or bad person or villain in any TV show in film they're all white so I guess seeing somebody else be a villain is probably just a bit jarring and uncomfortable for these very sensitive audiences and they're lashing out it's just utterly absurd the color of your skin does not dictate your personality it does not dictate how you are going to be as a person it should not dictate the characters that you play on screen and on top of that the people tweeting this nonsense they've apparently not even finished the TV show they have not even gone so far as to read an analysis I have not watched a single episode of the show but you know what I did I read like four articles about it I read the spoilers I saw that these bullies have a character Arc they are not just bad people he is not a racist and you people need to get a freaking grip okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "X6WUsyhHgrs": "is the Border closed do you believe that the border is closed or is it open it's open not close your body is open it's open because we enter we come in three no problem welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper as you all know because literally everybody is talking about it if you are even in the politically adjacent sphere the midterps are rapidly approaching and I believe that the economy is the most important topic in polls right now education is also huge the social issues really are not that high at the moment and another big one though is immigration which I'm going to talk about today because people have started using some very interesting tactics with immigration to get their point across but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already arrange that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection so to start us off just to you know lay the foundation get a good overview this is what Kareem Jean-Pierre who is the White House Press Secretary has to say about the current immigration crisis Trump Administration which largely just tried to build a wall an ineffective wall along the border and couldn't even finish that in four years we're certainly doing a lot more to secure the the border and could be doing even more if Republicans would stop their obstruction so so she is saying that Trump did not do enough to secure the Border he wasn't able to finish it in four years yes that is because he kept getting blocked by democrats and then when you and your Administration took control you halted the construction of the border wall and then quietly last month he said well actually we're just gonna patch it we're just we're just gonna we're gonna finish it so are you finally going to admit that it was maybe a good idea because now you are actively putting taxpayer dollars towards finishing the wall which I'm actually very insupportive guess you caught me right hand I also want to know what kind of obstruction they are talking about because basically every Republican that I know is in favor of strong borders and immigration reform and making sure that we have better legal Pathways to immigration and fixing this problem so that we can help people get refugees in if they need help reduce crime reduce the drugs coming in like we care about that so I don't know what obstruction you're talking about well actually I think I might know the obstruction Kamala has some new guests outside of her home that were sent by Governor Abbott from Texas maybe this is the obstruction the Korean Jean-Pierre is talking about this is two buses worth of illegal immigrants who have been dropped off in DC outside of kamala's Home sent from Texas they're just hanging out they're just waiting to be told what to do and where to go pretty quiet scene but then this is probably my favorite comment fox and a few other media Outlets went out and got interviews with some of these migrants and one person said this and vice president Harris said that the border is closed is the Border closed do you believe that the border is closed or is it open it's open not close your body is open the border is open do you believe that all the migrants believe that the border is open yeah everybody their boat is open it's open because we enter we come in three no problem and then but it's open for you to come illegally right legally yes illegally that's true and you came illegally yeah we came illegally not legal he's right [\u00a0__\u00a0] I have never seen somebody so excited about saying that they came somewhere illegally like Korean Jean-Pierre I am sorry Biden has not done more to secure the Border when somebody is on National Television saying I did something illegal and it's okay it's great we came in it's free I just walked across no that's not a secure border if you're saying that you you know made progress on the border the only thing you're doing is making progress on an open border which very few people actually want or think is sustainable under all of these videos people were making fun of Kamala having to deal with these immigrants which like why are we even making fun of her like that is her job to work on policy and correct these problems so it really should not be a joke but somebody said maybe she can open a bed and breakfast at her home which actually cracks me up because the way that Democrats paint Republican states like the trauma that people go through and how awful it is for immigrants like maybe these people do need some r r after having to deal with the trauma of living under Governor Abbott's rule for a single day like maybe they need some Bond charge products to help them optimize their life again because as you all know by now Bond charge is my very favorite Wellness brand that has a huge array of products that are designed to help you sleep better perform better recover better reduce inflammation balance your hormones reduce eye strain reduce headaches basically everything you would need to help calm your system after crossing the border illegally and having to deal with the trauma of a Republican government so if you find yourself struggling living in a Republican state and you need some help go to bondcharge.com Cooper and use promo code Cooper at checkout for 20 off your order again that is bondchart.com Cooper in the newsprofocode Cooper at checkout you will not regret it I love their blue light glasses I talk about them all the time but they have changed my life now obviously DC mayor Muriel Bowser has been very outspoken about immigration and how much she hates Republicans basically so this is what she had to say about Governor Greg Abbott after he sent those migrants to kamala's house your message to Governor Abbott who continues to try to hammer his point home is that I for for me you know there's a political debate to be had about immigration uh the points that I want to make is that we have to have a system that makes sense that's fair and that gives people a pathway to citizenship who are here and that is something that has to be handled by the Congress and the president for Mayors like me and that are dealing with a crisis not of our making and we're not a Border Town we don't have an infrastructure to handle uh this this type of a level of immigration to our city but we will will create a new normal here in our infrastructure and have a a Humane welcome for people and an efficient you know service provision but we we don't have the ability we're not Texas I mean that whole clip is just covered in like sweet sappy passive aggression I mean she has those little moments in there where she's saying like oh we're gonna deal with it and we'll welcome them and all of that and then she has those moments where she's saying we're not Texas we're not a Border Town we're not a border state we shouldn't have to deal with that okay so you're just gonna leave Texas to deal with the hundreds of thousands of people that stream through our border every single month and if you do want to leave them to their own devices then leave them to their own devices and don't turn around and start criticizing how Texas chooses to deal with the crisis you cannot have it both ways so since you are wanting to be involved since you speak on immigration I'm sorry you're gonna get a taste of what they have to deal with because 101 migrants showing up in Kamala Harris's front yard is nothing compared to the tens of thousands that flood through Texas every single day so sit down shut up handle the problem because now you are getting a tiny taste of what people in bordertowns deal with every single day because I don't want to hear any more of your passive aggression DC is not the only town that is dealing with this though because Abbott has also been sending migrants to New York City and for the last couple of weeks Eric Adams has completely changed his tune about immigration from saying we are a sanctuary City we welcome everybody to going oh my God we do not not have places for them this crime is going crazy we don't know what we're going to do with them they've been putting them up in hotels and last night he was on record saying that the city is at a Breaking Point with the arrival of migrants sent from Texas yeah you think you're at a Breaking Point look at Del Rio again the hypocrisy comfortably smug commented on that and said finally some good news we need 50 buses sent to President Obama's Martha's Vineyard to state next well now that you mention it they are in Martha's Vineyard as well that is the third place they are currently being sent because DeSantis wanted to get in on this action so he sent 50 migrants to the island 50. just remember that number 50 migrants his press secretary responded and said Obama has a mansion that can fit a few doesn't this is kind of the meme of the internet right now to the Island's credit the local community has handled it well they met the migrants at the airport they got them food they got them shelter they you know put them in a church they're trying to find them jobs apparently but this is getting National media attention and they are parading around how happy they are to have these immigrants here and how well they've been able to handle it while right-wingers are trying to create the narrative that Martha's Vineyard is overwhelmed and angry and to be honest both just seem a tad ridiculous because to people on the left obviously Martha's Vineyard can handle 50 people it is 50 people that is basically you know a tiny wedding in a way like people deal with so much more try the hundreds of thousands in South Texas this is not a mega win for you stop virtue signaling into the people on the right again it is only 50 migrants they can handle it it is a bit ridiculous to say oh they're overwhelmed this is you know it is a dunk it really isn't it's just 50 migrants the greater offense to me is that this is what gets media attention not the overwhelming numbers crossing the Texas border every single day not the trial trafficking not the drugs being brought in not the people washing up on Miami Shore every single day in makeshift boats and you know there is a big debate going on about the morality of these moves from DeSantis and Abbott I mean I have right wing friends that absolutely love it and support it and I have friends who are also on the right who have responded by saying this is Criminal this is immoral and don't call yourself pro-life if you support this that sort of thing like this kind of comment somebody said I think we should secure the Border but dumping these people off in random places and advertising that is sick and twisted they are human beings they look bewildered and where do they go from here they should not be used in this way for political talking points this is immoral obviously this is an incredibly nuanced issue as basically everything is these days but my take is these people came into our country illegally literally they are admitting it on National Television whether they were going to be in Del Rio Texas or Miami Florida or in marva's Vineyard or in New York City they were going to be in a new random place they are still safe it is fine they came in illegally they do not have a say in things and maybe this is harsh but I don't care but I don't think that they should and additionally these blue Cities Pride themselves on being Sanctuary cities and talking about open borders and criticizing how Texas and Florida deal with their immigration crisis but they never have to face it themselves and it is about time that they did because maybe finally that will get some national attention from DC so that we can make the necessary changes so yes you can absolutely say that this is a political stunt or a pre-mid term Ploy it absolutely is but I think that it is necessary people need to wake the hell up if these places cannot easily handle fifty a hundred two hundred a thousand five thousand migrants they have no understanding about what Texas has to deal with on a daily basis and until they do they need to shut up do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that Bell so you never miss an episode", "I13UaHII4CI": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper I am so excited to talk about this person today because I just think his character Arc his you know character development over the last few years has been fascinating and very exciting to watch we're talking about Russell Brand but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection Russell Brand as you all know he's an actor he was in you know Forgetting Sarah Marshall he was a comedian and he was always very very Progressive but people started to turn to him for advice and philosophical thoughts especially surrounding you know spirituality and addiction he was very very transparent as he was going through that himself and he started a YouTube channel that became very very popular and then during covid he had the audacity to go against the grain and question the mainstream media and science trademarked and people of course labeled him an extremist and far right in a conspiracy theorist and he has not been deterred one thing that I love about him and one thing that I also love about Joe Rogan and those types of thinkers is that they are purely in search of the truth they are genuinely curious and interested in hearing both sides and trying to find like the root of the issue the real honest to God objective truth which is apparently something that people don't believe in anymore but the truth you can't handle the truth and the left absolutely hates it because he's a threat to them obviously because he speaks to people on both sides of the political aisle and they hate when people are able to do that that's why people who are on the very far left this spies me because apparently I'm effective because I am palatable to people who are not just far right extremists which is ridiculous big things are happening with Russell because he just got a very very severe lifetime ban warning on YouTube and here is his video explaining what happened very briefly we have been officially censored by YouTube they took down one of our videos for misinformation but why are big media organizations not censored for misinformation in the same way I'll have to be careful talking about it now because I don't want to make the same mistake that's had one of our videos pulled down and an official warning issue the good news is we're moving to rumble all of our content is up on Rumble first and we'll be streaming on Rumble every day we have been persecuted for misinformation and it's right we have a responsibility to make sure that the information we convey is absolutely 100 as accurate as it possibly could be in the mistaken video we said that the NIH were recommending the use of what we should have said is they're trying to say it that's what we should have said you pointed that out to us we made an apology video we've taken that down as well YouTube took down our original video we've taken down the apology video because in case we reiterate the claim while apologizing for it so both of those videos you can watch right now on Rumble they're still live on Rumble that's the reason we're joining them because they're not going to censor our content and this misinformation strike and take down demonstrates exactly what it is we're talking about and the reason I think it looks like censorship is because there's mainstream media misinformation up all the time now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person that video is up on YouTube right now in my opinion that's misinformation so we're asking is there one standard for Independent News broadcasters like us on our Channel and a different standard for what we would call the mainstream media yes there is Russell and he understands it which is why he is moving from YouTube to rumble he is still going to have a lot of his clips on YouTube but he is moving his live stream his Daily Show over to rumble all of his uncensored unedited episodes will be up on that platform it is super exciting and he is making waves in the very based Common Sense side of this country and the world because he really speaks to people just really everywhere and there's an incredible 16 minute video where he goes in depth about exactly what he said exactly what was wrong and then give so many examples for all of these videos like that Rachel Maddow clip of politicians and Democrat Elites who are spewing lies and nonsense on YouTube uncensored to really drive home his point so the video in question that got taken down by YouTube like Russell said was filmed earlier this month and it was about that horse drug and I would love to go more in depth about that video and that horse drug and my experience with said drug in the midst of the coveted pandemic and the multiple times that I have had coveted but I don't think that would really fare well for me on this platform but just as an overview basically all Russell was saying was that the NIH has started exploring this said drug and they put it on their website he was excited about it but he was also pointing out how a moral and criminal it was that for the last two years they've been suppressing information about said horse drug and mocking and defaming people who had the audacity to go out and try this very affordable FDA approved treatment option and then tell people about the results and their experience but because Russell said that the NIH was promoting this treatment option rather than exploring this treatment option even though they put it on their website his video got taken down now I really want to tell you about the details of the video in question that got struck down because it is actually on a subject and about a drug that I am very passionate about but I don't think discussing that in detail would really work out for me and this video might also get taken down so if you want information go watch his video hear it directly from his mouth you can go check it out on rumble or if you want me to talk about it and my experience I can do that on an all access live on The Daily wire platform where I know that they will not censor me but until then I'll make this as uh appropriate as possible now because Russell likes diving into these topics and because he is unafraid to question the mainstream narrative and Elite politicians and the science trademarked the left wing media loves to portray him as being a conspiracy theorist and being dangerous and being an extremist but that is so far from the truth I mean literally just watch one of his videos and you see how loving and open he is I mean that is what people adore about him the fact that he is honest and that he approaches everything with a genuine curiosity and enjoyment just look at this clip I support and love all of you if you love Donald Trump I love you if you love Joe Biden I love you I want us to create new systems together I don't believe these institutionalized systems at the level of the financial governmental or media world are ever going to serve Ordinary People I believe we're at a point of Crisis and things need to radically change fast he's a monster he literally starts out his show talking about love light and unity he is not a conservative he is actually like a hippy-dippy dude that you would find talking about crystals and healing your chakras chakras whatever they're called in freaking Santa Barbara and people know it and they love him for it because he is so authentic somebody said you weren't censored for misinformation you were censored for being honest somebody said my God I love this dude he speaks truth righteously with love another person said you've just single-handedly moved Millions to rumble I mean just go look at the comments on his 16 minute video where he says so YouTube took our video down like people adore him not just because he's like oh you're fighting the good fight but because he does it with so much love and honesty but like I said that does not stop the establishment and angry progressives from tearing into him and deeming him dangerous I think we should protest like this person said I see Russell Brand has made the move from not funny comedian I never cared for to anti-science grifter who still isn't funny another person said the fact that some of us turned to Russell Brand for social philosophy and direction is proof that we are in the worst timeline somebody replied to that and said when Joe Rogan Russell Brandon Jordan Peterson are considered your great thinkers we are definitely in the worst timeline my friend that's just idiotic all three of these men just want you to be free and empowered they want you to be able to stand up on your own two feet not rely on the government not [\u00a0__\u00a0] and moan about being oppressed and apparently that's so awful yeah it is because we live in a victim culture where everybody wants to be the most marginalized person alive because that makes them feel better newsflash it does not being your own individual who is free who has autonomy is much more powerful than that I hope you all figure that out at some point somebody said idea instead of cosplaying martyrdom you could just use your platform to help people and real ways there's so many people on the left where they they [\u00a0__\u00a0] about celebrities and rich people not helping them enough like oh you built this entire Empire and this company why aren't you helping me weren't you giving me money he is helping people just not in the way that you want and he's not helping you directly because you don't want to open up your mind and actually think about any other opinions news flash hair too it's not always about you he is helping people he's speaking to them he's making them feel like they are not alone in this absolutely insane world that is helping them in some way just because he's not giving you money and talking about addiction as much anymore doesn't mean that he's doing something wrong and there are a lot of people that are calling BS on this entire misinformation situation because they said oh well you admitted that you made a mistake so they're not censoring you they're just trying to promote truth and being factual you admitted it yourself you made an apology video but if they meaning YouTube were just being factual and really just trying to you know get a hold of misinformation then why are there still videos of Biden up floating around on the internet saying you won't get coveted if you get vaccinated why is that video of Rachel Maddow still up the virus stops with every vaccinated person why is CNN's Channel received no warnings no Community guideline strikes why are they so focused on the phrasing of one thing that he said about the drug that is apparently so dangerous that we cannot even discuss it he hits the nail on the head with this comment right here this is in that video that I'm talking about you can bet your bottom dollar and your top dollar that the principles that are being used here are in the service of establishment Elite why are independent channels being attacked censored and bought down while mainstream media channels are being pushed highlighted and celebrated he is absolutely correct it is the principle of the thing and that's why I have said it before and I'll say it again this is why pointing out hypocrisy is so important and Russell is doing it expertly right now because it is essential to show people how ideologically driven these Elites these big Tech platforms really are they are so willing to shut you down to suppress you to literally hurt you while blatantly covering a protected class that falls in line with their bias and the sooner you realize that they can turn on you in just a matter of seconds the more radicalized you will be just saying like I said it's really catching people's attention even some big names like Elon Musk who replied to Russell's Twitter announcement affirming his decision and he has agreed to make an appearance on Russell's new Rumble show here is the announcement amazing show who are you planning for your future guess I love Glenn by the way we're going to be talking to Vandana Shiva we're going to be talking to Elon Musk yet are musk's coming on next week who else we got coming on here I love that he's just so nonchalant about that he's like oh right Elon elon's coming on like that is epic now we just need to get them and Rogan and Peterson and Shapiro all in one room I mean the amount of free speech and authenticity and Brilliance at one table would probably be the most triggering event of the century we need more voices like these and they are just bravely leading the pack and I love it so go watch Russell's new streams on Rumble you won't regret it do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that Bell so you never miss an episode", "JDgObRJo_yM": "breaking news it's day 220 of being a girl and we have another boob update Dylan look I have boobs like there's no question about it and this is officially my boob shirt right but wow look at that side angle whoa here please hit me as hard as you can sometimes I forget that I have them like yesterday I hopped out of the shower and my Uber Eats delivery was here so I wrapped myself in a towel around my waist to go get it and as I was opening up the front door I remembered that I have these and that I can't just show them off I'm glad you covered up something else the thing that weirds me out about this is not his like sweet goofy personality but it's the fact that this is like a mid-20s man acting like an 11 year old who just hit puberty stop trying to be a little girl that's creepy somebody commented and said I died laughing at the masculine whoa and then snapped back to token femininity LOL this is too messed up to make up yeah all the token femininity the little r movements it's a caricature but we know that", "DTJ4EfkalNQ": "what's up guys welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper so to start us off today uh my producer sent me this video randomly and said that it would be perfect to react to i don't exactly know what i'm getting into i've sort of seen it i'm slightly scared but i'm more so just excited for this journey that we're about to go on it's really how i feel about everything these days this is a body positive model with anorexia i can't believe i'm doing this and now for something completely different i missed that collaboration i knew i wanted to get vaccinations oh god this is a pfizer ad is everything to me oh my god ew can we have that in there i can't believe that i was just force-fed a pfizer ad it also felt targeted at me because it was all hollywood stuff do they know who i am model test holiday known for her bright red hair and body positivity she's amassed over 2 million followers on instagram she's also amassed something else i'm going to get cancelled moving on and major brand partnerships but below the surface tess says she's been suffering with an eating disorder i wasn't taking care of myself in the way i needed i wasn't looking after my mental health in the ways that i should have i was always making sure that everyone else's cup was full and i wasn't filling my own so i think that's how i went so long without really being able to address you know myself and my disordered eating i'll eat later but later never have i just have a question a decades-long eating disorder a decade multiple decades of anorexia the people that i know with anorexia don't look like this holliday sought help and now says she has a form of anorexia a revelation that has received some support as well as anger and skepticism i am plus-sized but advocating for diversity in larger bodies to folks that don't believe me you know that i'm anorexic and that this is what i'm dealing with um it doesn't really matter because at the end of the day this says my truth if this resonates with you if you oh it's your truth it's everything is always their truth they're going to make a huge deal about it they're going to make all of us watch and absorb their truth that's not my truth that is not truth maybe that's your problem it's not an objective no the whole my true thing i swear it makes me so angry you know if that's absolute bs her response to people who are skeptics does not matter yeah that means you're lying you lie you lie and we're supposed to just sit here and go along with her delusion and like smile and nod and say yes yes you have anorexia you that's your truth we're all supposed to just like spin our heads on backwards and smile and not with everything going on in the world right now smile and wave boys smile and wave it's back right it's just i can't okay keep going test confided in the council of anna sweeney specializing in eating disorders who says tess has atypical anorexia tess says it was her psychologist who initially diagnosed her a shock even for the model i told the psychologist well i won't eat all day you know i'll maybe have like coffee or maybe i'll have uh you know a handful of whatever's around me and then at nighttime i'll have my meal or snack she's still eating me i thought that that meant that i was a binge eater and the psychologist looked at me and said i don't think this woman knows what a single eating disorder is she thought that having one meal at the end of the day was binge eating i was planning on talking about it later i was a binge eater that's not what it is okay sorry we'll get to that later you can't look at someone and tell whether or not they're healthy you just can't i understand people look at me and i don't fit what we have seen presented as the diagnosis for anorexia but then for me that tells me that there's a larger problem which i've been actually saying for years is that we have a lack of diversity and representation in the world now we have a lack of diversity and representation in the eating disorder world is that what you mean and are you trying to make an eating disorder into like a diversity inclusion and acceptance platform wow so apparently it's probably oppressive for anorexia to only include very skinny people we need to include all bodies in anorexia the dsm-5 come on dsm-6 let's get it going let's edit let's edit that stuff okay almost done tess says she's on a healthier path which for her includes three meals a day and a focus on the future i have been happier in the last six months through my recovery than i've been in my entire life i feel whole i feel at peace i really feel in my power for the first time before i get into uh my thoughts about this which is obviously this is the comment section we need to read some of the comments i can't believe the comments are turned on for this brutal yeah honestly props to them because when people turn off the comments i mean it is absolutely a beta move like grow a pair and listen to what the internet has to say about you you're putting it out there deal with the consequences so props to this congratulations to tess for defeating anorexia completely and to an extent never seen before in history oh god no comment moving on skipping one day or waiting until nighttime is no longer called fasting it will now be labeled an eating disorder shall we call it intermittent anorexia oh yeah that's the epitome of our world right now i mean literally any tiny thing can be turned into a disease or a disorder or a system of oppression yeah i don't intermittent fast eye intermittent intermittent anorexia anorexia eyes what would what would that be as someone who has struggled with anorexia and had many people in my life struggle with it as well this is a slap in the face so much more than what she's talking about not to say that it has anything to do with your weight but there's much more criteria you have to meet not just skipping a few meals a day unintentionally yeah right there and and not everybody with an eating disorder has anorexia i feel like i see that all the time where it's like this is not some blanket term for people to use that if you you know struggle with eating then oh i must have anorexia no that's why we have a lot of different terms for that i mean full transparency i sort of mentioned it before but i was a russian trained ballet dancer for 15 years it took a major toll on my body image and eating habits it was awful i mean i loved dance but they were very intense especially after you hit puberty and around 15 i started binge eating and i went to therapy for it and i made a ton of changes in my lifestyle i even went to overeaters anonymous for a time like it was a whole thing but it was hard and i'm not trying to minimize the struggle because obviously people deal with this all the time i honestly think that most women probably struggle with some sort of eating just because the culture that we live in but like this woman she is an attention seeker like we don't all just need to run to doctors and get diagnosed with something because we're skipping a few meals a day it's clear obviously that she does have some sort of disordered eating not trying to say that she doesn't but on the spectrum of those disorders i think she's on the opposite side of anorexia take accountability realize that you are probably focusing on something else or that maybe i don't know if something else is going on make it a priority you do not need to put it all on the internet and make a whole sob scene about how we need anorexia to be more inclusive it's ridiculous do you want to be the only person that is not caught up on the internet's latest chaos i don't think so so make sure you subscribe and ring that bell so you don't miss out on any comment section content", "1YbdU84La70": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper guys it's election day okay it's happening everybody stay calm everyone what's the procedure everybody's running to the polls the midterms have finally arrived we have been talking about

let you guys know how it goes but we can't jump the gun because as of today it is still midterm season I just want to say that regardless of what happens at the polls tonight I sense a cultural shift and I see it in my own comment section I see it online people are waking up they're drawing these lines in the sand they're realizing that things don't make sense they're coming back to common sense I love to see it so regardless of what happens just know that we at least have that in our favor we either oh wow I was going to be really drowning me like we are the revolution we're we're crusading instead I'm gonna have a bruise on my hand just know I'm very excited guys but before we get into this story make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you've not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com to check out my merch collection this is not really a story today rather a compilation of some cringe because I think everybody's a little on edge today it's tense you're trying to figure out when you're gonna go to the polls it's just a lot going on so I wanted us all to have a bit of election humor because politicians obviously are very eager to get people to the polls especially the younger generation and these campaigns and activists have started using some unique tactics to reach this Target and apparently certainly the only tactic they've come up with is Tick Tock and I really hope it's not working because this is terrible terrible marketing and knowing gen Z I feel like we can sniff out what is cringe what is actually genuine and authentic and what is like corporate trying to be cool and so because I think we all deserve to laugh a little bit today we're gonna watch all of them and I apologize in advance we're going to start off strong today with Obama and an ogbya Obama's in a lot of these he even did a campaign speech the other day in Georgia where he said get off your phones give Tick Tock a rest and and go to the polls and then suddenly he's literally owning my for you page like Obama you get off Tick Tock please for my own sanity anyway here's the video I'm a 41 year old on Tick Tock and I talk about OB GYN stuff and sometimes the commenters they say Okay Boomer and I'm like definitely not well look at this gray hair I do qualify as a boomer but you've boomed here's the thing that people need to remember there are eight million young people who are going to be newly eligible to vote in this election we can reinstitute Roe versus Wade as law of the land despite what the Supreme Court so you're saying listen to your elders go ahead go to iwillvote.com link in my bio and make a plan to vote today and you don't qualify as an elder but I do that's why I love you that was not funny at least they were sort of self-aware in the beginning where they were like people call us you know Boomers and say okay Boomer yep it's because you are here's another one this is uh Gretchen Whitmer this one really Takes the Cake because while Michigan is struggling Gretchen is dancing [Music] I think those might be her daughters I really don't know but Gretchen nobody wants to see you dance at all somebody said why do these people think that they are celebrities somebody replied and said because they get paid about as much as celebrities with The Insider training the money laundering Etc the corporate buyouts all that fun stuff another person said now I'm going to vote for Republican twice as hard yeah anything to get her out Kerry Washington who is actually a celebrity got involved and she's helping Stacy Abrams in Georgia campaign everybody loves Stacy Abrams a lot of people are doing this trend you're gonna notice a commonality here ain't got the memory I smoked it all away hey [Music] mostly trying to record then hit hood for today I don't want to vote for Stacey Abrams and I'm so glad I don't live in Georgia so she is not even on my ballot thank God all of the comments on that one were like oh my God death Queen my favorite Stacy's Gonna Save Us all what has she ever done other than claim that the election was stolen from her and that she is the true governor of Georgia you are not at all a man named Tim Ryan in Ohio who is running against JD Vance to be a senator in Ohio also had his own take on this trend this is with his social media person [Music] at least he's acknowledging that he is not the one making the tick tocks that there are some gen Zer behind the camera that they have obviously hired to be like make me look cool make me go viral and the kid's probably like you can't really just make something go viral and the guy's just like already dancing it's so weird another one Bill Nye the Science Guy is not running but is a huge Progressive activist now he's obviously talking about climate change [Music] lovely dancing you have their bill we're gonna keep on moving through these this is Katie Porter in California she did this one with Gavin Newsom funny yes but not funny haha funny weird especially with this one I'm just sitting here thinking about gavinusum and his weird slicked back hair you know leaving the podium after giving a speech and he has a social media team being like you gotta do a tick tock Trend you gotta do it it's so strange it's so contrived they are kind of fooling people because everybody in the comments are like oh my God blue heart vote blue this is so amazing yay democracy you're so cool I mean it's just so cringe and it's cringe because they obviously are not Tick-Tock Stars it's not somebody that is running for congress that happened to have like a viral video on Tick Tock and is now leveraging it these are elected officials being like I'm going to make something go viral this isn't your average everyday crunch this is Advanced cringe and are trying to get into gen Z's mind because they're all living on our for you Pages while offering nothing of substance not telling us at anything about their platform or their policy it's just ridiculous here's another one oh this is Beto okay I've reacted to this one on a tick tock but I wanted this to permanently live in a comment section video Beto did this Tick Tock Trend the same little Dancy one with a fan [Music] it's so bad this video made me actually listen to the lyrics of the song with like the big booty and hips come get in my car and Beto's like doing a little come hither look uh uh let's do a little seductive dance about abortion no let's not Beto let's really not this is Kamala with Tick Tock Chris he's the viral one who delivers coffee to people he used to be in that really famous relationship and then they broke up and all that stuff if you're on Tick Tock you know who he is Vice President basically on a light-hearted note can you tell us your coffee order oh yes um soy latte a soy latte okay hey hi I brought you both coffee have you voted yes you get all your friends who go to iwillvote.com of course how and where and when to vote Yes yes of course I did here you guys go cheers that makes me never want to drink coffee ever again well that's a lie I have one right here I'm gonna drink it later but in the moment it makes me not want to ever drink coffee again all of this is basically the embodiment of the hello fellow kids scene from 30 Rock that whole meme that literally is what we just saw how do you do fellow kids every single video somebody replied and said the saddest part is them thinking that this cringe Fest will somehow encourage people to vote for them if it does then we're in even bigger trouble and somebody replied and said exactly what I consider the people might actually be influenced by this I realize that I should go live in the wilderness as we're close with my own normal thoughts literally me every single day after doing the show I just like need to go sit in a hole somebody else said this took years off my life another person said they got cheating on their side so they don't give a about how stupid they look very valid but also on a positive note for us they do seem very desperate which could be a good thing I don't know now last but not least we have actor Mandy Patinkin he's an activist now you might know him from Homeland he's won many Tony Awards he was in The Princess Bride and this one might actually be my favorite it's only five seconds long but if I stopped it no I just can't stop watching it it just keeps going you could leave it on a loop it's like I'm being hypnotized this is only one of their many voting videos there's also a video where Mandy is half asleep and somebody comes up and opens his mouth and pulls a piece of paper out of it that says go vote it's like very weird somebody replied and said I like you a lot I've always liked you but I have to be honest this is terrifying I agree somebody said the only good instance of celebrities urging us to vote is Manny batenkin and Catherine Grody going all grandma and grandpa accidentally ate my Edibles I mean it's absolutely absurd but I respect the hustle I respect them trying to get the fellow kids and youths to vote I actually do wedded this one on Tick Tock and had a response to it but I went back to pull comments from the original Tick Tock video this morning and they deleted it and I should have taken screenshots yesterday because that video got on the wrong side of tick tock for them it was all people being like thank you I will go vote red thank you I will be voting red all the way down and they were freaking out and they were like what no this is not the right audience so they deleted it and apparently they did not like it but I guess that's a positive thing for us and I'm glad that this video will forever live on comment section and on Twitter because it deserves to be seen we are at a point in 2022 where they are so desperate to get people to the polls to vote blue that they are waving their arms with vote painted all over it anyway guys that is your election compilation for today I'm hoping things go well we will see what happens in the morning hopefully no natural disasters that have ruined a bunch of ballots or something like that happened I have no idea we'll check back in tomorrow I'm sure that there will be a lot of tweets and comments for us to review fingers are crossed okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you can follow me on Instagram and I'm Brett Cooper", "8_iWrcyVVyw": "welcome back to the comments section i'm brett cooper i have not done an episode on guns in a bit things have been pretty quiet but every once in a while you see a gun take that is just so bad that you cannot ignore it and honestly i think this one takes the cake and i'm so glad that the internet has recognized this and is pointing it out because we would like to think that most people are rational in the world but it's still mind-boggling to me that there are people that think like this but before we get into it you guys know the drill make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and go check out my new merch collection go to dailywire.com brett to check it out i hope you all like it it was super fun working on it and creating it this is just our first capsule so i'm excited for all the ones to come now for the more important story there was a woman who got into a bit of a debate with this one account on twitter they were going back and forth about conceal carrying specifically for women as a form of self-defense in her reply to him she said i'm a five foot 125 pound female every man is a potential danger to me if i have a concealed weapon it will not automatically bring it on if i have to stand a trial in order to not be raped and killed and then she goes on uh to say so be it i would rather be alive and have to you know defend my actions than be killed or raped his reply to her he did not just reply he quote tweeted this so it is forever on his timeline he replies to her and says glad you feel that way you'd rather do 20 or 30 years in the pen rather than having to give in to unwanted sexual assault in your mind i guess it's a fair trade-off first of all disgusting and out of line like the most twisted argument i have ever heard telling a woman that she should allow herself to be raped so that she doesn't have to use a gun for self-defense and doesn't have to worry about dealing with the trial or going after her assailant as if unwanted sexual assault is something we all just take lightly and like who the hell wants that by the way is there such a thing as wanted sexual assault no the only person who wants it is your rapist get it through your thick head dude obviously men are also victims of sexual assault men also get jumped they get attacked that is a real thing but i don't think this guy understands what it feels like to be a smaller framed woman especially in a bigger city i remember going to school in la before i had a car and i would have to take public transportation and i would take like a bus to downtown at 5am so that i could make my 8 a.m class and then take the train all the way down to santa monica and was walking through skid row at sunrise basically i don't think he understands what it feels like to know that everybody around you could be a potential threat and you would do anything to protect yourself in that instance hell yeah i'll carry a gun and i don't care if i have to explain myself in terms of self-defense in front of a jury i would rather be alive i don't think this guy has any idea that as of research a few years ago at least 1.9 women are victims of rape and assault every single year and more than 200 000 women this is in the same study deploy a firearm to successfully get their assailant off of them to disarm them every single year obviously there are millions of people in the world millions of people in the united states but that is still a significant number people say that guns are the great equalizer for men and women and i firmly believe that i'm not somebody that just walks around collecting a bunch of guns just so i can go like woo like second amendment whatever i started blasting bam wow no it is a form of protection especially for women this guy is an ass but i mean it's the internet so that's to be expected but anyway this man obviously got put on suraj's list uh he said deleted but the list comes for all and if you're not following the list you should be it's one of my very very favorite accounts and siraj uh who runs it is awesome but after this i really don't know if the listed tweets can get better or worse like someone else agreed with me and said i think this is officially the worst take the list can be retired now there are no words left for alexander to conquer which is true this honestly i have not done an episode purely on a list tweet ever i think but this one was worthy because it was so unhinged so that just goes to show but the account is fantastic someone else replied and said while misguided i actually do believe that this was a comment about nyc's backwards justice system and i think that this does provide some important context this guy i believe is from new york city and he was specifically talking about not wanting his fellow citizens to be armed around him because i think you know the supreme court overturned a ruling in new york that banned people from concealed carrying so now people can get their carry permits without having like a threat against them which was the former policy and if y'all remember there was a horrific incident a few weeks ago where a bodega owner stabbed someone who had attacked him this guy and his girlfriend had attacked him and he stabbed and killed somebody and then he ended up being the one who got charged even though he was acting in self-defense and the girl who survived was let off even though she attacked him thankfully those charges were dropped after there was intense pressure on nyc's new da and that bodega owner then announced that he was leaving new york city closing his store and going somewhere where he would actually be protected by the law which is such a mood i would too if protecting my life was going to get me thrown into jail that's honestly one of the reasons why i left california i wanted to live somewhere with law and order i went to idaho first then i ended up in tennessee i want to be somewhere where i know that if i need to defend myself i will be protected it's that simple the same guy commented and said countdown to accountdeletion321 which usually is the case if you get listed by siraj and you are a smaller account you often go silent you often you know protect your tweets go private delete your account not this guy this man did not stop i mean he is more unhinged than seth rogen on twitter and that is saying something after he was listed he quote tweeted and he said what list the list of wacko gun nuts me not worried you're just looking for someone to attack it's only words you want to shoot people looking for any excuse or maybe not you just want to murder i ain't surprised the gaslight fringe most gun nuts are alike like is this man having a psychotic break people are pointing out his terrible take where he is so anti-gun that he is apparently pro-rape and now he's saying that siraj wants to shoot people listen listen there's a lot to see in this life not wasting it here no sir i think you are the unhinged one he obviously did many more tweets about the list too many for me to list here he said i ain't scared i can ignore your asinine list quote tweeting it every few minutes really is not ignoring it buddy he just like kept going and was like i don't care it's a free country i don't care this is my free speech literally nobody is censoring you we're just pointing out the fact that you're an idiot somebody said imagine being so anti-gun that you're pro-rape and this guy says only an idiot would draw that conclusion no not an idiot anyone with a rational brain could think that considering the argument that you just made even if you were trying to talk about the nyc justice system in the d.a who was not protecting people even though that was the case you could have said it in a better way that did not expose your deep rooted hatred for guns that you are willing to put other people's lives in risk so that you do not have to be uncomfortable when people conceal carrying around you just as like an anecdote i feel so much more comfortable living in a state with constitutional carry idaho is the same way knowing that there are probably people carrying around me makes me feel good i would rather be in a situation where somebody can pull a gun and protect the people around them than waiting like a half hour for the la cops to finally show up don't worry one of us will save you in just a minute [Music] that's just my personal take then he brought rittenhouse into it obviously because we're talking about self-defense somebody said imagine having this take after kyle rittenhouse gets off and he goes the written house trial was rigged okay sir great but then we got a taste of his other political leanings which honestly just made this whole thing even more confusing he retweeted an article from the new york post trump nemesis uh rep liz cheney defeated in gop primary which is so great i don't know if you guys have been following that story but she lost so hard it was a beautiful thing anyway mark says that's okay liz come to new york city you'll be touted as a hero stood up to the zealots trying to overthrow our government you should be canonized for this wyoming votes are just brainwashed followers i hated your father but i have mad respect for you again just unhinged he posted an article about rudy giuliani uh and he said fantastic i hope they grease his prostate that's an image i really don't want to see i don't want to imagine rudy in any position really then you start talking about texas texas is a state of heathens anyway savages i think that's a slur these days sir this one's just gross he goes this was after the raid well now trump has something in common with many women he now knows how it feels to be raped so he's trying to you know walk back his comment about being so anti-gun that he's pro-rape and saying oh it wasn't about rape it wasn't about that and then you see this tweet where he is equating trump being raided by the fbi to women being raped your excuses for that comment are completely invalidated by this tweet you obviously could not give less of a crap about women's safety about them not getting raped because everything is politicized to you i honestly can't tell if this man just wants attention and he's wanting people to recognize him if this is some cry for help or if he's actually losing his mind it might be both this might actually be a cry for help maybe somebody should go check on him the whole account is just a mindfulness to say the least he goes on these unhinged rants about guns and trump and texas and race and all this stuff he did a whole bunch of stuff on white privilege but then in the midst of all of that you see him have some semblance of a base take about the irs and other things like that and apparently he did vote for trump at one point but then he got trump derangement syndrome like i don't know the whole thing is just a fascinating character study which is most people on twitter to be honest but the point here is twofold and number one there are people out there who would rather you be a victim than carry a concealed weapon because it makes them uncomfortable because they are so self-centered could care less about our rights could care less about you being self-reliant because they're feelings that's a fact number two there are states that are so communist and backwards at this point that you could be charged with something other than self-defense in a situation like that and that is horrific and that should not be the case and you have to choose whether that is a risk that you are willing to take for me i chose to leave i first moved to idaho then i moved to tennessee like i said knowing that i could confidently take the proper measures to protect myself and be covered by the law if god forbid anything happened i'm not relying on anybody else i don't care if that makes this man uncomfortable that's just what i'm gonna do guys we are adding new comment section content every single day so make sure that you are subscribed to this channel and ring that bell so that you never miss a video see you next time", "3zZY09X6L1Y": "I'm going to show you what it's like hanging out with boys all the time and I cannot make this hey just telling Jared about I picked up a job at the Death Star so I'm pretty excited about it I emailed Elon Musk about figuring out light speed because I do have to commute until they give me a typewriter on lease I'm a little worried about the job you know if I do something wrong do the whole death choking thing but I think honestly that's gonna make me work harder that's gonna make me work harder because I don't want to die no I want to please the boss I'm going to work my way up and if I'm able to come up with a plan that defeats the Jedi for Mr Vader I don't know fast track to success is All I'm gonna say this just screams that this guy wants a date am I wrong in that dudes are going to be dudes but this guy he's putting on a show for this girl like that's all I'm saying somebody commented and said I'm getting Robot Chicken Vibes somebody said gotta dress for the job you want I mean hey more power to him I guess", "ChU5IjB7h6A": "don't let thin white people ever convince you there's only one way to live a happy life [Music] somebody commented and said I can't tell if you're going to live a happy or sad life but I definitely can tell you that your life will probably be shorter than usual yeah when she's dying at 35 she's probably gonna find a way to blame it on white people like white people didn't tell me to lose weight um I am", "h_o6cuuzRZ0": "we should accept that pedophiles are people who have not chosen their sexuality i'm sorry how about we don't do that thanks very much welcome back to the comment section i'm brett cooper you know i thought that i was going to have a normal nice tuesday afternoon and then my producer texts me that pedos is trending on twitter so we are in for a wild ride but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and ring that notification bell so that you never miss that's my harry potter ringtone but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you are not already and ring that bell so that you never miss a comment section episode anyway now that we've dealt with that interruption pedos is trending on twitter because twitter just banned the word groomer on the platform so now people are just being honest and saying pedophile which i really don't have a problem with i do have a problem with them banning the word groomer seems like they are protecting the wrong people if you catch my drift lgbtq nation wrote an article about it twitter enforces its ban on calling people groomers as anti-lgbtq hate speech a right-wing commentator got suspended for tweeting okay groomer at a trans woman he was having an argument with so that is how twitter and a lot of other platforms are rationalizing this they're saying that it is a slur that it is homophobic and so nobody is allowed to use the term anymore twitter's representative for their health product communications team said we are committing to combating abuse motivated by hatred prejudice or intolerance particularly abuse that seeks to silence the voices of those who have been historically marginalized classic term for this reason we prohibit behavior that targets individuals or groups with abuse based on their perceived membership in a protected category use of this term groomer is prohibited under our hateful conduct policy when used as a descriptor or in the context of discussion of gender identity which is really how it is used these days i am not trying to promote people walking around calling any gay person groomer that's wrong and it's not right and it's a very dangerous generalization but i do think that the word is appropriate when we are talking about the sexualization of children at a very young age and if you think that it is not happening you can go back and watch any of my videos that you would like especially the shorts and especially the tick tocks where we look at children in schools as young as two years old who have sexual identity and gender identity shoved down their throats [Music] i'm sorry if you think that i'm some ultra right wing maniac because i don't want two-year-olds to be thinking about sex that's just how i feel so in that sense i do think that the word groomer is appropriate twitter apparently does not twitter was also accused of not enforcing this policy prior to this week because apparently it has been around for a while but they have not been suspending or banning people so once this was all brought to their attention they have started knocking people off the platform like crazy temple was suspended for saying okay groomer a couple of other right wing commentators that kind of thing they are getting knocked off the platform right and left and they're getting all those messages that say like you need to delete this tweet in order to get your account back whatever they are going full steam ahead this is a classic example of a left-wing tactic where when the right makes headway in the culture war or just anything in general the left thinks that their only course of action is to run in grab the word grab the topic redefine it say that now we are marginalizing people that we're pressing people and then throw it back to their side i mean literally yesterday the white house announced that we are changing the technical definition of a recession so that they can claim that biden has not gotten us into a recession this literally happens every single day and now it is happening with groomer somebody said pedos is trending because we're supposed to be accepting of pedophiles now according to scholars no hell no i spent a lot of time trying to help survivors put their lives back together after what monsters did to them how about we think about them instead and then this person retweeted a video that i think is actually from 2017 which is even more horrifying the fact that this has been going on since 2017 and we are just now attacking this conversation i do think that that is a common problem with the right it is very very slow to catch on to these topics to catch on to what the left is subconsciously putting into our culture it's like the other day when i was talking about the stupid cow them that was in 2019 and we weren't talking about it this has been slowly going on they have been chipping away at what is good in our society and we are just now freaking out about it so i guess the lesson here is that we just need to be on top of this stuff this has to be stopped at the beginning and so redefining words and saying that we can't talk about grooming not really a step in the right direction for our fight it is an our responsibility to reflect and to overcome our negative feelings about pedophiles and to treat them with the same respect we treat other people with we should accept that pedophilia is a sexual preference these people can't talk about their feelings because they know that they will be hated for it yeah rightfully so we're talking about a sexual orientation something that we simply cannot change you did not have to do that you knew you did not have to do that no i want them gone they haven't done anything wrong they want to molest children i'd say that's pretty immoral and then the first woman said that we all need to start respecting pedophiles and acknowledging the pedophilia is some kind of sexual preference no i'm not going to that's creepy if you are a pedophile you are sick in the head i don't think that if you're gay you're sick in the head but if you want to have sex with kids yeah i'd say that you are yeah this was going on in 2017 and we are just now talking about it i'm not saying that the entire lgbtq community is made up of groomers there's a fantastic group called gays against groomers that are actively fighting against this within the community they are absolutely incredible but there is one side of the political aisle that is advocating for this kind of behavior that excuses it that says things like that i'll call all of them groomers i don't care if you're gay straight buyer whatever if you are advocating for it groomer i'm pissed that twitter won't let me say it now south park per usual predicted this here's a video from a few years ago again i don't know how they do this but they just know here we go our forefathers came to this country because they believed in an idea an idea called freedom they wanted to live in a guy just looks like that's right for their beliefs where a person can live the way he chooses to live you see us is being perverted because we're different from you people are afraid of us because they don't understand and sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand dude you have sex with children yeah you know we believe in equality for everybody intolerance and all that gay stuff but dude [\u00a0__\u00a0] you seriously that is literally what we are living in right now these people are you know spewing their anecdotal you know [\u00a0__\u00a0] all of their feelings all of their emotions i don't care how many stories you tell we're not excusing grooming somebody replied to that video of the professors the scholars talking about pedophiles and said how we just become less tolerant of scholars this person wrote back terry and said oh sure people who are afraid to think about different ideas and learn to hate everything are easily manipulated by those who aren't by the way that doesn't mean that you have to like or accept those ideas but it forces you to have an effective argument doesn't it terry i don't want to have to have an effective argument against pedophilia i don't want to spend the time having to come up with one the argument is that it is immoral and these scholars are sick in the head for wanting to spend time studying it and getting us all to empathize with these pedophiles it is an our responsibility to reflect and to overcome our negative feelings someone else said pedos is trending on twitter because pedos are trending in our culture literally yes jake shields actually got knocked off for using the word groomer and said after being suspended for calling somebody a groomer i check to see what twitter allows i found there's tens of thousands of pedos on here that refer to themselves as maps that is a minor attracted person they talk about being attracted to kids but we will be banned if we call them groomers strange times that's absolutely true twitter also has porn twitter has disgusting violence and yet calling out grooming calling out talking about sex with three-year-olds apparently that is the real violence why the hell do these people have an acronym are you gonna have a flag next is there a pedophile flag dear god i hope there is not but that's probably the next step it's gonna be added to the rainbow flag with the v and all of the different colors in there god that's just upsetting that last comment reminds me of reddit because reddit also recently banned the word groomer it is one of their new restricted terms and slurs and this was posted by the political compass subreddit and they said hey look this is a new thing from reddit people caught on and started posting it over all social platforms reddit lies tweeted and said reddit has banned the word groomer given that reddit censors you if you speak out against children transitioning i think hashtag predator is a fantastic alternative and then they posted the screenshot from a post that was talking about how people only 18 and older should be allowed to transition and you see that reddit removed it because it was inappropriate so because of all of this reddit users quickly came up with that new term predator rather than groomer we'll see how long that lasts before it also gets put on the chopping block this happened last week and it spurred people calling for twitter to do the same so like i mentioned i think twitter has had that policy about grooming in place for a while but they are just now really starting to crack down on it so it's probably maybe correlated to the whole reddit thing i'm not sure but regardless these platforms are covering the asses of disgusting gross criminal behavior i already talked about what's on twitter but i don't even want to get into what is on reddit it's just disgusting and it's hypocritical and our society is corrupt and devoid of any morality is basically the lesson here do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news i didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that bell so you never miss an episode", "yaECK1Y6YbY": "welcome back to the comments section I'm Brett Cooper we're going to be doing some Tick Tock drama today which I always enjoy doing because it can be a break from the normal news cycle and for a lot of people that are not on Tick Tock I feel like this is my chance to welcome you into the chaos that is that platform and today we're going to be talking about a very well-known makeup Guru on Tick Tock but before we get into it make sure that you like this video subscribe to this channel if you have not already ring the notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection alrighty so Michaela naguera is a tick tock makeup artist she has 13.5 million followers she blew up during the pandemic she was working in retail prior to that she moved back in with her parents was working like three jobs and her platform blew up now she you know travels around the world doing makeup getting brand deals she has tons of designer things she lives a very lavish lifestyle online but this has only happened in the last couple of years and she she's talked extensively about you know what it took to get there however a video has resurfaced from 2021 where she was talking about the work that goes into her videos and how she doesn't really work a traditional nine to five and people were really hating on her at that point for saying like why are you showing us your designer bags you don't understand what it means to be a hard worker so she was venting and clapping back and she has apologized in the almost two years since this video was posted she's apologized for her tone and how she said it because people ripped into her back in 2021 and they are ripping into her yet again here's the video it's kind of edited in a weird way and they tag on some of her other videos in there because they're trying to make a point and she's since deleted this video so I don't have the original for you but you're gonna get the gist just finished working it's 5 19. try being an influential for a day try it flash here here's the bag the edit does really pain-hearted awful light so like I said they have cropped out a comment that she was replying to that says why don't you go get a nine to five you could never do it and then prior to this little cut she says you know I woke up at 6am and I started filming at seven I filmed for six hours and I had these meetings and I did this I finished work at 5 19 and then she goes on to say that I'm gonna go to an event later whatever so she kind of explains her whole day of you know what goes into these videos but they did cut that out and then they just tag on a bunch of videos of her holding up designer bags that she's been given which just is a bit ridiculous but you know it's making a point but this has now made its way off of tick tock I typed in her name and look Insider NBC News Yahoo the independent and these are just a few this is just in the first page on Google all of these people are writing about this resurface video from 2021 that she has already apologized for time and time again yet she is getting harassed essentially on the platform uh she is trending on Tick Tock I don't it made its way to Twitter I saw a few memes but nothing huge it really was kind of centric on Tick Tock and then apparently left-wing news media wanted to talk about it as well but people are making videos about her these are a couple of examples like this girl's doing a like a parody being an influencer for a day try it it's 2 30 p.m on a Wednesday my work day is just now ending and the shitty part is even though it's over it's not really over because now I have to get ready for my happy hour plans with my friends and I have nothing to wear so I have to get up drive to the mall and buy a bunch of  okay I got this Chris from Gucci and I got these pants from Zara and then I also got these Balenciaga sneakers to match oh and I got a purse from Louis Vuitton but my driver's here to pick me up for happy hour so I'm in a rush I'll show you guys later I mean it's a bit much but I have seen videos like that and it just makes you laugh essentially we just finished working it's 5 19. try being an influencer for a day try it this is the bulk of the videos under that sound under that sound bite of her saying you know try to be an influencer is people talking about their jobs and saying you could never handle it you don't get it my job is much harder than yours here's a public defender this girl got really heated we just finished work and it's 5 19. try being an influential for a day try it she her caption is I'm sorry but Michaela you need to check your privilege I hate when people say that I'm sure you work hard but to complain like that without acknowledgment of your unbelievable privilege when so many people followed you for your relatable content is super disappointing I hope you will clarify or retract your statement and then she has like public defender life criminal defense whatever retract your statement which is kind of ironic because literally she has already apologized and retracted her statement and that clip was taken out of context as a lawyer you might want to see that but I get it you just finished a 16-hour day you're walking home at 1am you're probably tired you probably didn't look into it very much but the main point is this whole situation has been completely blown out of proportion these videos are hogging up my for you page they're now bringing up old things that she's done that they want to cancel her for apparently she's used slurs in the past but nobody can actually tell me what slurs those were she also bought foundation in a darker color at one point so that she could use it as bronzer which apparently is cultural appropriation and is racist did not know that my makeup artist buys me darker color so that I don't look like a ghost apparently that might be racist I'll let her know when I finish filming how could you it's just the internet has too much time on their hands they're now commenting on all of her videos saying must be so hard to apply that makeup hope you got done with this video before five make sure you don't work until 5 19 PM I can never sit down and try makeup you are a girl boss definitely keep it up Queen don't overwork yourself it's just moronic but then I started to see that under all of this initial chaos because I was really getting disappointed in people because this is not that big of a deal I started to realize there were so many people actually defending her not saying like oh she does work so hard whatever but but just pointing out this mob mentality online people piling on bullying people canceling people for absolutely ridiculous stuff because of how bitter and miserable their lives are and so like this lady she's a big Creator on the platform and she's coming to Michaela's defense [Music] and she calls it a Witch Hunt which I absolutely believe is correct and that is not just on social media but just look at how you know people on the right are treated in real life where people are literally hunted down whether it be by the government or by people in their Community online for saying ridiculous things and I'm not some expert I don't know the reasons behind all of this but I do think it has something to do with what I just said earlier which is that we have had it so good for so long and now people are miserable and bitter and they're trying to find things to be angry about as my mom always says they're making a cupcake out of a crumb basically just you're angry good get angry in addition to that then if one person starts canceling somebody or pointing out that they don't like something that a creator has said an influencer has said a personality a news anger whatever then a bunch of other people want to hop on the bandwagon they want to say their two cents they want to to be a victim as well maybe it all goes back to that it just goes back to this entire culture is based on victim mentality everybody wants to be oppressed everybody wants to be hurt because it makes them feel better about themselves so sensitive but anyway the fact that some people started defending her was a white pill in all of this and then I also started to see that some of the most liked comments under her videos where everybody else was saying oh you're working too hard to work until 5 PM were once like this it's true it's a lot of work she made it to where she's at while also working a full-time job in retail she's allowed to vent I think that's a huge point no matter how easy or hard your job is we're all going to have awful days it's fine to be able to say oh God that sucked and then move on the person said this video was from two years ago in response to a hate comment saying that being an influencer was easy and anybody could do it very important context did not just happen a couple of days ago somebody else said I don't get why people are bullying her because she said being an influencer is hard with comments like these I can see why it's hard that one got a ton of likes and then somebody else said people forget that influencing I hate that word is a 24 7 thing you don't turn your your lap off at the end of your shift it's your entire life every waking day this whole situation has kind of been fascinating to me because to be honest I always looked down a bit on influencers and tick talkers and you know the kids that got famous and rich on Vine because I remember when they started getting jobs in Hollywood and I would be so pissed off because you know I had worked for 10 years as a child actor training and sacrificing my childhood I was like a real actor I trained and to be honest it still kind of bothersome just because I don't think they're great actors but I digress now I host a YouTube show and I am a content creator and I so I guess I influence even though I so really hate the word I wouldn't consider myself one it's just odd and it is a hard job in many ways but it's nothing in comparison to you know the things that other people do doctors you know First Responders people putting their lives on the line for other people every single day and any influencer that is using their platform to shame those people or say that their life is harder than them is just ridiculous but I genuinely don't think that that is what Michaela was doing you know everybody has their heart there are a lot of things that I couldn't do and I'm sure that there are a ton of people that wouldn't be comfortable doing what I do and that's totally fine and for a lot of people the reason they wouldn't want to do this job is for the reason that that last commenter said and it's because you are always on like yeah I work a nine to five in a you know a company structure but I usually get in earlier than a lot of people and I work later and you know if I'm you know working at night I'll be going to an event or filming or doing something and if I'm out with my friends or doing activities I often get texts from my team saying hey make sure you're filming content like take pictures your life really is on display for everybody you're giving a part of yourself to the public which is fine it's what I signed up for but that part of it is very weird but it's still not harder than anything that anybody else is doing it's still a job so I guess the point here is that social media has forced us into a hyper comparison oriented society and we have known this forever at this point especially with Gen Z and it's where everybody is you know jealous and bitter and thinks that the person next to him has it better and because this person posts like this oh their life is so much better than mine and I wish I had that like I'm even guilty of it but the victim mentality the thinking that the next person ahead of you is life is so much better than yours it's not fulfilling it's not going to make you a happy person it's not going to make you good for the people in your life it's just try to stay away from that as much as possible gratitude is so important especially when everybody is trying to make cupcakes out of crumbs hey hey hey I can't believe that you were about to click off of this video without liking it first that was honestly rude be better", "kGr0PPNxKo4": "I just saw someone post on their Instagram story from their bed saying I have a flight in an hour will I make it oh okay bored in 32 minutes and you're not vertical yet oh okay this girl the other day posted a video where she said I have to be at this important dinner in 15 minutes but get ready with me get ready but they're lying there's no way if you actually had to be somewhere in that small Middle School amount of time that you'd be making content I am so happy that I'm not the only person who gets emotionally invested in Tick Tock because these people make me so angry it also just solidifies the fact that social media is not real like people will rent a private jet just to hop on at the airport take pictures and leave they never had parents who constantly made them late for everything and it shows yeah I have anxiety about being late I'm everywhere like 15 minutes early", "2GwpGiXz5io": "[Music] while our bodies [Music] well i will say the part where she sang the justices names kind of catchy not gonna lie it just wasn't happening for me dawg i mean no dog this comment section did in fact pass the vibe check somebody said anyways what do y'all want from the store yep somebody else said this just saved america thank you another girl said i want out of this hellscape i can't figure out whether she means the hellscape of having to listen to this song or the hellscape that is you know post row america either way i agree with the first one", "zAv2UODng_E": "and you want it and you picked it out but you don't have to but you don't want it for school can you tell me why because last time i wore a dress to school everybody called me a girl what makes a shirt for a boy or a girl nothing so do you want this you picked it out i do want it do you think bright pretty colors and dresses and sequins and jewels and golds all the things that you always want to wear do you think that's your innermost you everything about this is creepy you are intentionally using him to try to go viral on social media to prove that you are the most progressive parent did he actually want to wear a sparkly dress because your tone at the beginning of the video where you were like you wanted it right you liked it part of me really feels like he did not pick that dress and let's be honest kids want to wear anything crazy and colorful that doesn't mean that they are expressing some gender expressions or something yes exactly let kids be kids", "ge2nm22NknI": "welcome back to the comment section I'm Brett Cooper I have not talked about the view probably since the very beginning of the show I think I did a couple of episodes about them back in the spring but they've been pretty quiet since then you know they're screaming every day there's a new conservative on The View who really isn't that conservative at all but you know the deal they scream they end up trending on Twitter I watched the videos and they just make me annoyed they had an interesting guest on yesterday that really stirred up some chaos so we're gonna talk about it but before we get into the story make sure that you like this video subscribe to the channel if you've not already ring that notification Bell and of course you can go to dailywire.com Brett to check out my merch collection so this special guest on The View yesterday was Ted Cruz and if you know anything about Ted Cruz whether you love him or hate them you know that a lot of people really dislike him they also call him the Zodiac Killer and the guy does not care he just goes and he does his own stuff he preaches what he wants to preach and I really admire that because he is undeterred even though people aggressively very much do not like him and he put himself into the bullpen which I really respect and he went on to the view knowing that that audience and those hosts do not like him that is just wild to me and I love it because it just goes back to show the people on the right we are willing to have these discussions with people we are willing to put ourselves out there and debate to us it's actually a good thing it's an important part of having principles and being a person that is opinionated and so many people on the left are too frightened to have any sort of debate and so I love that Ted went and did this and he put himself out on the line and the internet is having a field day he talked about election denying across party lines because obviously those women wanted to talk about January 6 because apparently everybody wants to talk about January 6 in the January 6th committee all that crap anyway he got into it here and I apologize in advance there's some screeching try to say the election was fair and square and legitimate you know who y'all don't do that to you don't do it to Hillary Clinton who stood up and said Trump stole the elections who said that the election and was stolen they sat here and said it was legitimate and you guys were fine with it we may not like when Republicans win but we don't go and we don't storm we don't try to change but we don't know did I miss an entire year of antifa riots where cities across this country oh oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I don't know what an antifa right is give me a freaking break Whoopi I don't know what an antiva Riot is city is burning Portland every single day Seattle New York Los Angeles people running those streets that's just arrogant and disgusting anyway so are we going to continue the left doesn't engage in violence really no they wanted to know I'm our friend Mike Pence of doing something we didn't do you said Hillary Clinton didn't say whatever she didn't say I'm saying to you listen my God ladies give it up I like I think about Whoopi going well well Hillary was just here saying that and it was her opinion to her the election was illegitimate okay so then you're saying that it is a matter of opinion people can question an election the people can criticize government officials but only if it's Hillary Clinton no if it's Hillary Clinton it's totally fine but Trump no absolutely not I don't care if you think that an election was stolen I don't care if you think that somebody was rightfully elected these women are literally ridiculous they are spewing nonsense Ted was very level-headed he was quiet he was giving facts and they were just squawking over him actually this commenter put it well she said Ted Cruz clucking with the hens on the view is gold if he was on that show I'd watch it every single day absolutely yes because they had no idea what to do with it this man is handling that situation like a champ those women are obnoxious I would lit I would lose my cool I could not do it so it is just incredibly impressive because that is a ridiculously stressful situation it's almost as stressful as buying a car which is why it is so great that we have karzing to help us out carzing is an online car shopping website that partners with over 25 000 dealers

to carzing.com Cooper to get started today I wish there was some kind of program to help me make dealing with liberals hassle-free quick and easy but we have not invented that technology yet like whoopee the screaming about how well oh it was Hillary Clinton's opinion she was allowed to say that it was illegitimate because it was her opinion okay well you just destroyed your entire premise in arguing against every Republican being able to say that the election was illegitimate congratulations you played yourself they have no principles ever and then where this clip kind of trails off is Anna Navarro telling Cruz that he needs to calm down which I don't know if you remember at the beginning of that clip Ted was very quiet and it was them that were screaming at him so look what she says Hillary Clinton in 2002 George W Bush was selected Not Elected Joe Biden Al Gore was was elected president so Joe Biden yeah okay no no I agree okay then lower your voice because we are very close to it I'm sorry we just said we don't scream with each other literally let's roll the tape back let's go to that first clip here where they're yelling let's go back they sat here yes and said it was legitimate and you guys were fine with it okay so it's illegitimately Republicans no you know here's the thing it sounds like y'all are talking over each other and clucking like that commentary said don't give me the like oh we're all quiet and docile and you're an angry Republican man screaming at us no you've been engaging in that as well and because you have no response to the things that he is saying the very legitimate factual things he's saying you all got quiet because you have no response and then you're going to accuse him of being aggressive and Loud because you have no rational response give it up my God I love this comment somebody said okay guys Ted Cruz just absolutely shredded the view live on air Anna Navarro was so owned so hard she literally had to beg him to be quiet lol accurate yes you do not have to be a huge fan of Ted Cruz to acknowledge the factual nature of everything that he was saying and you also don't have to love Ted Cruz to acknowledge that questioning the results of an election is not some new far-right extremist phenomena it's been around for years it's what everybody does so give it up again that's gonna be my phrase for the day then Heckler started to get more intense they were obviously cheering for the women on The View they got quiet when Ted was reading that list of Democrats because obviously nobody had anything to say but then they came back and got even more intense and Whoopi even had to tell them to shut up and I appreciate appreciate that she did that because she could have riled them up so that's kind of a point for her I guess explained in the United States inflation has one cause and one cause only in inflation in the United States has one cause and one cause of it and that is when the federal government spends too much money last year the federal government took in four trillion dollars in tax revenues most money in history the problem is we spent nearly seven trillion dollars in that ladies ladies excuse us let us do our job let us do our job we hear what you have to say but you got to go I appreciate that little moment there where they all kind of laughed that's what this country should be you should be able to go on a show and laugh and have cordial conversation and talk about your different opinions without unleashing holy hell on Ted Cruz so I appreciate that they at least got to this point these people are literally throwing a temper tantrum because Ted Cruz is in their presence like the liberal tears are following throughout New York City actually though the leftist Tears are Falling throughout most of the country right now as we're gearing up for the midterms and with this election day on the horizon we can expect 2022 to be one of the wettest years on record that is why for the very first time we we are making the iconic daily wire leftist tears tumbler available to non-members this tumbler was forged in the fires of the hottest Politically Incorrect takes and This Magnificent vessel is now just thirty dollars and when you pick up yours you will also get 30 off of a daily wire Insider annual or all access membership so what are you waiting for go to dailywire.com Tumblr to get yours today and I promise you you will not be disappointed [Music] here's another clip they actually had to bleep all of this people at home are saying okay is my life better today than it was two years ago and I think for the vast majority of Americans the answer is no come on guys so they're saying like go to commercial so then they went to commercial after that this is what people who were watching it live saw this is what the tape shows they just bleeped it out and according to Cruz's special advisor for communications who was there somebody in the audience yelled [\u00a0__\u00a0] you Ted Cruz and then you see all the women kind of going okay we need to roll to commercial so they bleeped all of it and then they immediately went to Commercial and tried to handle it now we have some behind the scenes footage from people in the audience thankfully because I love this I did not want to just see the bleeped version do these people have jobs what are you doing during the middle of the day screaming at the view I mean I'd love to scream at the view but also I have a job so I can't even though my job sort of is screaming about the view these are just deranged climate people I know we've talked about all of those climate protests in the UK but guys they are also here in the United States it has literally become like a religion to these folks they can't even think about anything else there's another angle if you hear the transition music they're going into commercial so those are completely different girls in the first video so it looks like maybe there was a group of like five of them that all came to protest the fact that the view was platforming Ted Cruz and was not talking about Clive that was not bringing on an environmentalist I don't know this girl posted the video and she said I just had the best day ever it started with yelling [\u00a0__\u00a0] you Ted Cruz you climb it denying piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] and ended with my professor using my paper titled albertus tar Sands a crime against humanity as an example of what an a looks like for the entire class that is the third saddest thing I've heard today you sound bothersome to me you really do but I appreciate you posting the video of you screaming so that I can laugh and we can all talk about it because it's utterly absurd thankfully though Ted Cruz is just very used to blocking out all all of that noise and actually while he was in New York filming The View he went to see the Yankees play the Astros at Yankee Stadium to support his Houston baseball team and New York did not like that also I'm sure it did not help that the Astros won so look at him he's just like yay like these people are disgusting look at him smiling and waving kill him with kindness Cruise kill him with kindness this is really just a lesson for all of us he's not giving in to him the man is just acting like they're all his fans and I really appreciate that this goes on for like another 10 seconds but I think you get the gist this is the party of Tolerance you know the party of Love they're really representing that great American ball game that's supposed to bring us all together he's just ridiculous and one of the things that annoys me the most about this is that these people are just parroting the same brainwashed phrases and tag lines that they use to attack Republicans if you have a problem with an elected official you will absolutely have the right to criticize them I have the right to say oh okay I really like Ted Cruz but obviously there's some things he's done that maybe I haven't been a fan of that's totally fine and I'm allowed to say that but these people are just brainwashed into thinking that every single Republican is the worst thing in the entire world they have no creative insults they're not actually saying anything of substance so like sit down shut up and stop acting like a deranged toddler you are embarrassing yourself across social media it's not a good look do you want to be the only person not caught up on the internet's latest news I didn't think so so make sure you're subscribed and ring that Bell so you never miss an

Annie know about it feels like all that arrogance is just a show Amara Anthony seem pretty insecure over there also  I ain't ever scared of you I we ain't ever scared of you I've Hawk the loogie right in your girl's face writing the man's face these men that you say are women CIS women ain't the turfs that you can protect and you are gonna rot in hell and I'll be first to send you there ending to go get a real last name I love that these people parade around believing that they represent love and tolerance oh we're all for women's rights except if you are a CIS biological and then you can rot in hell great thank you that makes me feel wonderful also you say that you are anti-racist do you want to uplift people of color this man literally is a person of color you should know that by his last name Eddie nego no he's freaking Filipino you did not do your research before sending that message now underneath all these voice memos he said lfmao and I'm still booked blasted on billboards please talk to me about how you're about to stop my bag dumb useless Turf shut the frick up shut the front door I'm so glad you guys all got to experience that with me it's just utterly ridiculous now he did all of that went through all of that effort sending those voice memos simply because he got caught being a piece of threatening people on the other side of the issue and then went viral it seems like those are the consequences of your own actions and now you're worried somebody replied and said the standard response to things like this uh everything special about you came out of a bottle yes or from a doctor somebody else replied and said that person was hateful and misogynistic it was not a counter protest it was an effort to intimidate and terrify women into silence that can't be what coach wants to be associated with its brand I would hope not somebody else said uh I hear a whole lot of projection did they talk about that in his Yukon Sociology class yeah probably with all those fancy words like attachment Theory and stuff like that somebody else said the fact that coach has not made a public statement regarding this in almost a week is insulting to their female customers it absolutely is so one Twitter user simply took matters into his own hands and he said I called coach two times I got hung up on after I spoke about the issue the first time they are aware of the situation but as the department of customer service reps they have no comment I asked for a department to contact gave me the number of the coach New York headquarters and he put the number put your fingers to work he then replied and gave this update and said coach rep says that they are working on a statement and he has been dropped from their company I requested a rep to contact me with updates and she says that coach does not condone Anthony martucci's conduct hashtag Amara Vasquez which somebody replied wide but aren't they best friends and somebody said probably in the way that UConn is the best college in Connecticut God the insecurity just runs so deep now I have no idea whether this guy is legit whether he has actually talked to Coach whether coach is really dropping this Anthony Amara guy I mean they should I mean I don't even care about the political differences that the two of us obviously have but I do care about the fact that he is literally threatening women with violence being absolutely disgusting publicly nude like those are not things that a brand should want to stand behind and promote and if coach does decide to continue supporting this person then I guess people have yet another company to boycott it feels like that list grows every single day it is incredibly overwhelming but either way this is just yet another example about how the left is absolutely hypocritical in every single thing that they do that they say that they are loving intolerance and that all of these counter protests and everything that they do is all for uplifting minority voices and protecting the most marginalized of people and yet you see them on camera spewing violence slandering people of color threatening women it never adds up it will never ever make sense okay that was fun and those people are crazy if you want to see more videos like that make sure you subscribe to this Channel and like that video and if you want even more content you
