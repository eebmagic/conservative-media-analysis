    "JyFt8ikIurs": "[Music] we have nine days left we have nine days left to put an Administration in office that respects your individual liberties respects the police wants to change what's happening in our education system and make sure that Gretchen Whitmer never serves in office again in the state of Michigan we are in Detroit Michigan and we're going to be spending the day today with Republican gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon and hopefully we'll have a little time to talk to the voters too to find out what they care about with this election coming up so how's it been it's good good very good it's been kind of shocking for the Democrats because the momentum has been a such a quick swing Tudor Dixon won the Republican primary on August 3rd just days after receiving a last-minute endorsement from president Trump I had one of the folks from the media asked me an interesting question she said I listened to your exception speech and I listened to your speech tonight and I think you hit Whitmer pretty hard do you think that you're coming off as a mean girl the truth hurts with almost no name recognition she was trailing incumbent Governor Gretchen Whitmer by almost 20 points but within weeks she had cut whitmer's lead in half and by October the two women were in a dead heat all across this country we have a very clear choice between those who are more interested in furthering their own selfish ambition versus strong courageous leaders who are committed to upholding the Constitution Tudor Dixon is one of those leaders Dixon received some unexpected help on the campaign trail from former democratic congresswoman Tulsi gabbard gabbard announced she was leaving the Democratic party in October and has since been traveling to campaign with candidates like Kerry Lake Joe Kent as well as Tudor Dixon Tulsi how did you choose tutor as someone you were gonna campaign with uh I mean really for a lot of the reasons that she's talked about Democrats at different levels across the country are cowering in fear of these these radical woke ideologues who are in control of the party when you put tutor Dixon up against Gretchen Whitmer there's no comparison when when you're looking who's the Right leader for the right time in this state are you ready to take our state back she's honest with the people she's committed she can persevere she has a plan she doesn't just talk about a plan like Gretchen Whitmire she tells us what she'll do how she'll do it I think there was also the Roe v Wade and there were some doldrums after that where I was like ah no red wave and that has definitely been their message when Roe fell Mrs Dixon celebrated that I am fighting to protect our right to choose now there's a ballot measure on the ballot this year in Michigan to add abortion as a constitutional right so now people are starting to say okay well if you want to devote for that you can vote for that separately but really what are we going to do to get our kids back on track Mrs Dixon says that I kept students out longer than any other state that's just not true kids were out for three months yeah I'm pretty sure I just heard an audible gasp around town when Gretchen Whitmer said that kids were out of school for three months we even had schools that were closed this year this is shocking to me not on my watch that doesn't happen in a Dixon Administration and we'd like to put a focus on Reading Writing and math get away from some of this woke stuff Dearborn Michigan is a heavily Muslim Community and the Muslim Community has always voted Democrat I had a man come to one of our rallies a few weeks ago and he said we found these books in our school and went I went to the Democrat elected officials and said we've got to do something about this they pretty much told them we have want nothing to do with you he said I was called a bigot and a racist and he said I'm done I will never be a Democrat again I won't be voting for a Democrat and he said I'm going to talk to the people in my community and tell them they need to vote for a republican because it was funny he said no matter what the issue is environment or all of this other stuff that the Democrats are talking about he said at the end of the day my kids are the most important thing to me and if they're not willing to stand up for my kids then I'm done with their party yesterday they had Barack Obama here did you hear that [Music] I'm going to read you two headlines one says Whitmer signs order aimed at lowering insulin costs in Michigan these are actual headlights [Applause] uh second headline Michigan Governor hopeful uh two-door Dixon eaten by zombies in Gory for the film I don't actually have anything else to say he's not attacking my policies or my plan because he can't everything is going up cost of gas child care even a box of cereal costs four bucks look I can't solve the inflation problem Gretchen Whitmer has come out and been very clear that she believes there's nothing she can do on inflation but she's actually had several opportunities to put money back into the pockets of people so we know there's an opportunity to reduce the personal income tax to give a gas tax holiday to make sure that we make it less expensive for michiganders here to live I mean I've obviously been vocal about the policies that President Trump brought to the state of Michigan and that's something that was crushed in just such a short period of time since he left office my father brought a steel foundry in Michigan I worked with him on the shop floor for many years so I got to know the heavy equipment industry but also the automotive industry the big Automotive companies they're obviously not coming to Michigan you see them building new factories they're going to Kentucky Tennessee Ohio Indiana so when I talked to these young men about you know we don't have this national security issue taken care of when it comes to people understanding metal and how to make metal they said gosh it's funny because every time I heard America first I never really got it until I realized once we lose it we don't have it yeah now your things that you're talking about were business education what was your third one that was your crime we are also going to restore Public Safety I want to put a billion new dollars into policing to make sure we can recruit and retain police officers to bring back honor to that career crime is rising across the country you've seen a rising crime of four percent Michigan is over eight percent Michigan has four of the 20 most dangerous cities in the country we had Barack Obama kind of mocking the whole crime issue there's a lot of talk about crime right now it's gone up in conservative and rural areas not just in the city over the last seven years not just the last two by the way they act like the other guy one president when all that some of this stuff was happening one of the local papers did an article saying that we have lost a police officer a day in Detroit this year that's shocking when you don't have the support of the chief executive officer of the state Governor Whitmer joined to express her support for the spirit of calls to defund the police she vetoed funding for secondary Road Patrol she vetoed funding for Corrections Officers now in the last few weeks of the campaign all of a sudden she supports police they don't want to put their lives on the line every day because the cops are telling me man we could get shot or we could go to jail and why it's not worth it but if you don't provide Public Safety which is one of the fundamentals of government then you're going to have people run wild and we certainly don't want to end up in a situation like we see in New York right now when you listen to what Tudor Dixon is talking to people about what she's hearing from people it doesn't get any more real than fighting for your kids fighting for your jobs fighting for our economy fighting for Safety and Security it does not get any more real than that which again just shows out of touch Barack Obama is and uh and frankly Gretchen Whitmer as well I don't think people understand and appreciate what we have here and I want to protect it and Tudor Dixon will do that the future of our students and our really the future of our state is on the line right now we have to get our kids back on track we have to also make sure that we have safe cities we have to make sure that people can achieve the American dream those are all things that we can do if we get great children we're out of office",
    "-rJXsoWS5Do": "will Rising inflation and a deadly crime wave sink Democrats at the polls or will the so-called Dobbs effect keep Republicans at Bay we'll follow the money and look at how each party is leveraging the issues with less than three weeks to go plus Battleground Senate what do voters think of Blake Masters and Mark Kelly will release the latest daily wire exclusive poll right here from one of the most trusted pollsters in the business [Music] hello and welcome to election wire I'm John Bickley daily wire editor-in-chief with senior editor Cabot Phillips today we're digging into the issues that will help decide the fate of Biden's first term in office and how much influence his party has on Congress Kevin let's get right to the issue that every American is very concerned about and that's the economy that is exactly what this race is becoming more and more about and that is bad news for Democrats right now we've talked plenty on the show about how it was a summer of brutal news on the economy Democrats had a content with Rising inflation gas prices started to trickle down a little bit but then they started to spike right back up in the last month right and just this past week there was devastating news coming out from the labor department they released the final inflation report before election day and it showed that inflation has not gotten any better as Democrats been promising it's actually gotten even worse core price index is now up it's rising faster in one year span than at any point since 1981 and so the Republican message has essentially become hey remember how nice things were back in 2020 when we were in charge look at what you get under Democrat leadership and Democrats haven't really had an answer for that because they kept saying inflation all summer it's going to get better it hasn't now and so if you look at the numbers from 2020 to 2022 Republicans are highlighting just how much costs have gone up on virtually everything yeah let's drill into that a little bit what are the inflation numbers looking like right now so two years ago if you look at something like gas the average price this time two years ago 215 a gallon right now you're at 391 a gallon the inflation rate this month two years ago 1.2 percent this month 8.2 percent mortgage rates were down around 3.1 percent right now they're at 7.2 percent you've also got grocery prices 20 percent higher now than they were two years ago electricity in many states up 30 percent more expensive than it was in 2020. so virtually every category you're looking at things are more expensive that's no longer a mystery but what we weren't really sure of was what sort of political impact would that have we're seeing now all summer and into just the month before election day voter sentiment is completely shifting against Democrats on this issue 65 percent of Voters in the most recent CBS poll say the country and the economy is moving in the wrong direction just 15 percent of Voters say the economy is getting better historically that's been a key metric for predicting which party is going to have success right probably not great for the party they're very happy about that Republicans are very happy about that I should say well it's not hard to see why inflation is the leading issue for republicans and it appears to be working yeah and the more you dig into the numbers actually the worse it gets for Democrats another poll that same CBS poll I should say from CBS found by a two to one margin voters think that Democrats made inflation worse over the last year that's a big factor as well who do they blame for the current situation a separate NBC poll showed that 60 percent of Voters say that they want Republicans in charge of the economy in a midterm election where the economy is bigger than any other issue that again that's a key metric to be tracking and we're clearly seeing how effective this is by watching the money that Republicans are pouring into these campaigns and on which issue they're specifically focusing right exactly we always say follow the money if you follow the money in this case Republicans so far have spent 150 million dollars on ads touting the state of the economy in a negative way now it is worth pointing out Democrats have still spent almost 50 million dollars on the economy but their messaging is very different than Republican messaging the Republican message has been Democrats got control of the economy they pumped trillions of dollars into the economy and then what did that do it devalued the dollar it's hurting inflation they point to all of the spending as the negative aspect hurting our economy right now Democrats are now on defensive saying well wait a second the inflation reduction act as they call it all those stimulus payments remember the checks we gave you guys weren't those pretty good that actually kept the economy afloat and the real reason for inflation are it's it's greedy corporations it's it's profit and price gouging from you know these capitalists so they're blaming all the economic woes more on the private sector Less on government spending so both sides are spending on the economy it's just very different messages on how they're talking about it all right so that's the economy and the Republicans clearly feel that's going to be a winning issue for them yeah we've also got crime that's always been an important issue but in the last two years there's been a rise in violent crime we saw that in 2020 2021 we're seeing it again in 2022. this has become such a big issue that a lot of Democrats that were actually Pro defund the police have actually reversed course started really leaning into this message as well what do we see going on with the issue of crime yeah it's not hard to see why crime has become such a big issue pretty much every city and state saw a spike after 2020 and maybe in some states where crime wasn't as big of an issue in the past it is now front and center a recent political poll to that point found that three-quarters of Americans say that crime is still a major issue for them which again is an issue that benefits Republicans most polling shows them up in double digits on which party people think would handle crime better and keep in mind for many Americans This is their first chance to vote at a federal election since that defund the police movement happened there's a lot of pent-up anger over people saying hey you guys took money away from our police department and look what happened look at the crime going up a lot of people feels like feel like there's a correlation there right we saw that movement born in 2020 but we didn't see a lot of those policies implemented until 2021 2022 and now we're seeing the backlash against them and it seems like it's uh you know helping Republicans here and it also explains why Democrats have shifted their message so much on defund the police in 2020 2021 a lot of these candidates were cozying up to the movement it was it was a winning issue in many ways a lot of Voters still had a favorable view of the black lives matter movement of defund the police that has completely changed and you can see that by how candidates are talking about it even someone who's not really a candidate right now Nancy Pelosi we remember her famous comments where she said defund the police is dead Joe Biden got up at the State of the Union we all remember him proudly saying fund the police and get this even the D Triple C which is the the Democrat committee that that oversees electing as many house Democrats as possible they sent out an internal memo that leaked two Democrat candidates Nationwide and they said quote one of the things we found in 2020 is that the attack on crime the defund attack back often went unanswered and that was something we needed to address head on so they're now admitting hey we didn't really do a good job of talking about crime in 2020 defund the police is no longer popular they are now advocating for their candidates to have at least one current or retired law enforcement officer go on the record saying that they do not want to defund the police so fully top-down messaging to these candidates reverse course on this issue it's exactly what they're doing it's completely turning so as expected we're seeing the Republicans lean in on the issues of the economy and crime and that's really working for them in many states Democrats meanwhile are looking at the abortion issue as an opportunity for them to maybe pull over some voters how's that playing out Democrats were given sort of a political Lifeline if you will with the overturning of Roe v Wade now obviously that was a huge victory for pro-life groups and pro-life voters but whatever your thoughts are on abortion it's impossible to deny that it gave Democrats sort of a jolt in this race if you looked at the generic Congressional ballots coming into the summer before that ruling Democrats were down four or five points immediately after that job's ruling Democrats jumped up and they tied Republicans in the generic balloting impossible to deny that this was a winning issue for Democrats with especially Suburban female voters and Democrats they started spending big money as a result so polling has shown that the issue of abortion does play into the democrats favor and they've really bet the house on that they've invested a lot of money on that issue what is that looking like now what kind of numbers have we sent well if you look at the month of September alone John Democrats spent 73 million dollars on ads related to abortion that was a third of their entire budget so they're going all in and most viewers they've already heard plenty of what those ads sound like it's saying you know Republicans want to take away a woman's right to choose but the problem for Democrats right now is that the issue of abortion is quickly fading in the polls and Democrat leaders as a result they're now warning Democrats against leaning too close and too much into abortion for example James Carville the the famous Democrat strategist recently said quote you've got to be more aggressive than just yelling abortion every other Bernie Sanders had the exact same message he called it political malpractice for Democrats to only talk about abortion and not be talking about the economy he had a recent interview on CNN listened to his message I think Democrats have got the fight to make sure that it is women who control their own bodies not the government so I think this is a very important issue but I don't believe it can be the only issue uh at a time when we have an economy in which the wealthiest people the billionaire class are getting much much richer while working people are struggling to put food on the table it goes without saying that we have got to focus on the economy and on that topic there was a really interesting Harvard poll that came out recently where they asked voters which issue is most important for you and then they ask them what do you think the two major parties are focusing on the most and then kind of how do those two line up so if you look at the issues if you ask voters what do they think Republicans first are focusing most on the three issues are immigration inflation and jobs and coincidentally those are the three issues in polling that voters say are the most important to them so Republicans doing a nice job of lining up their messaging with the issues that are most important for voters now Democrats they've got a problem on their hands that's Harvard poll found according to voters the issues that Democrats are focusing the most on are January 6th women's rights and climate change none of those three issues fall in the top three for most important to voters and only one of them women's rights falls in the top five all of the other issues the other two issues there are not even in the top eight or nine for voters in this poll and so you've kind of got this dichotomy of Democrats focusing on issues that voters don't really seem to care about nearly as much as Republicans they're they're three for three on focusing on the things most important so we have a real misalignment there with Democrats and voters priorities that could be real problematic definitely seems that way before we get to another exclusive poll from our partners at Trafalgar we want to get a quick update on some of the states that we haven't talked about as much but still look like they're going to come down to the wire all right Kevin what have you got for us we're starting first with the governor's race up in Michigan now we haven't talked a ton about this race but it is getting much much closer than a lot of political experts had expected the Democrat incumbent Gretchen Whitmer is facing a serious Challenge from Republican Tudor Dixon the latest polling from Insider Advantage has that race tied keep in mind Whitmore was up by double digits throughout the summer we started to see signs of the race getting closer some polls do still have Whitmer with a sizable Advantage but again now that we're seeing polls that have tied you cannot ignore that keep an eye on the Michigan governor's race next we go down to North Carolina this was a state Republicans were hoping would be a little bit of an easier race for them given the fact that outgoing Senator Richard Burr was pretty popular in the state his seat is up for election now you've got Democrat Sherry Beasley in a very tight race with Republican Ted Bud latest polling shows are down one other polls Show Bud with a little more comfortable of a lead two to three point range but this is a state Republicans desperately need if they're going to take the majority in the Senate they cannot afford to lose this race and finally we go out to New Hampshire or democrat incumbent Maggie Hassan is facing a much closer race than she would have hoped for and much closer than many political observers on the outside looking in would have expected there you've got Republican retired General Don bulldock who is giving her a run for her money she was up huge at the start of the race over the summer but keep in mind New Hampshire has a very late primary Republicans did not elect bolduck to this position as the nominee until September December 15th so really early on in the campaign he was playing catch-up trying to get name recognition out there hasn't the start of the month had an 80 to 1 Advantage when it came to cash on hand for her campaign so Bulldog did not get his first Statewide ad up until October 6th on the airwaves and Republicans had been a little cautious about getting involved in this race at the national level but now that they see how tight the race is there's a seven point Advantage for Hassan other points or other polls have bullduck within one two even three points now the Republicans are seeing that millions of dollars are flooding into the state because we've got a race on our hands keep an eye on New Hampshire this is when Democrats were not expecting to be this close but there could be a Republican senator come November and this brings us to our under the radar segment where we're looking at races that aren't getting much national attention but could help sway the balance of power in November Cabot where are you looking this week I'm looking at New Hampshire's First Congressional District where Caroline Levitt a republican is looking to become one of the youngest members of Congress in history and she's doing it in a very interesting interesting way typically you know New England conservatives are thought of as a little bit more moderate to appeal to Independence and it's just a different type of Republican often up in New England Caroline is running as a staunch conservative she's proud campaigning on the fact that she worked in the Trump White House we got a chance to talk to Caroline recently with morning wire here's what she had to say about her campaign we knocked over 70 000 doors I'm at a different event s directly from voters inflation is at the top of their minds this winter literally people are going to have to choose between Heating and eating in our state because of this administration's policies so there she is talking about the key Republican issue the economy yeah and it's worth noting we did reach out to her opponent Chris Pappas multiple times got him on the phone they said they didn't have time uh for an interview but there are reinforcements also coming for Caroline Tulsi gabbard the former Democrat presidential candidate who recently left the party publicly announced that she'll be making an appearance with Caroline so starting to get more national attention Republicans and others turning their eyes to a race that very very few people thought was uh you know in reach for Republicans right all right so every episode we discuss some potential pivot Points a moment that we think could end up having a significant impact on a race we'll start with yours Cabot what did you see this week that you think was a major pivot point or significant moment well I like many people was keeping a very close eye on the Georgia Senate race the two had their first debate between Democrat Rafael Warnock the incumbent and Republican Herschel Walker there were a lot of eyes wondering what's going to happen with Walker how's he going to perform in this debate you know he's not the best speaker he's the first to admit that he calls himself sort of a country boy whereas Warnock has that background as a preacher he's a very eloquent speaker in many ways but Walker held his own in that debate even the AJC the Atlanta Journal Constitution traditionally a more liberal paper had a headline reading quote Herschel Walker's debate performance scores points for his campaign there were a few moments that really got a lot of traction online sort of the more viral moments but this is the one this one on abortion that had people talking that a patient's room is too narrow and small and cramped a space for a woman her doctor and the United States government did he not mention that there was a baby in that room as well and they also they did not mention that he asked him that he asked in the taxpayer to pay for it so he's bringing the government back into the room it's the only debate before election day early voting is starting in Georgia so I think that could be a real pivot point in this race well a razor thin margin in the polls in that race so all it takes is moving the needle a little bit with some of these voters and it could end up being the difference definitely well my Pivot Point this week is one that could impact the Arizona Governor's election CNN's Dana Bash brought on Democrat Katie Hobbs for an interview bash had interviewed Republican Kerry Lake earlier in Lake had called Hobbs a coward for refusing to debate her so bash she didn't pull any punches she pressed Hobbes why she wouldn't debate Lake the moment went viral for all the wrong reasons for the Hobbs team here are some excerpts Carrie lake has made it clear time and time again that she's not interested in having substantive in-depth conversations about the issues that matter to arizonans and she's refused to sit down in a one-on-one lengthy conversation she just came and sat down with me and and answered my questions for for a lot of minutes um yeah a lot of Democrats are questioning your decision if you think she's as dangerous as you're saying to democracy is it your responsibility as a candidate who wants to run Arizona to show and explain who their alternative is that is exactly what I'm doing right now so we see their Hobbs refusal to debate really coming back to honor it might Haunter on Election Day now for more on Arizona we're debuting exclusive new polling from the state with our partner Robert kahali of Trafalgar polling Robert welcome back on thanks so we're excited about this poll we dug down into the numbers in Arizona talked to a bunch of Voters what did we find on this Senate race that pits uh Democrat Mark Kelly against Republican Blake Masters well this thing is very very tight we've got 47.4 to 46.4 uh Kelly over Masters just I mean one point it is I mean this race every time we pull it it continues to get tighter so one point Edge for the Democrat Kelly incumbent yeah and what about the governor's race that pits Democrat Katie Hobbs against Republican Kerry Lake how's that shaping up carry light continues to maintain the lead she's had between two and four and three and this one is right at three and so it's it continues to maintain a lead okay so some strong momentum it seems like for her what did you find when you drilled down in terms of the the cross tabs in this pole well what we found most interesting is yet again young people are siding with a lot of the Republican candidates it's funny they don't identify as Republicans when you ask them what party they're in but when when you ask them who they're for they tend to be for that especially the party's not in power it's you know it's like you've been a casino all night you've been betting red and you say you know I'm just going back black for a while they're not becoming Republicans they just title what they're getting got it yeah because that's not a trend anybody was expecting we actually saw that with the Pennsylvania poll as well we're seeing it all over the country what about the minority vote in Arizona well the Monarch the most significant minority in Arizona is Hispanic and that is once again the Republicans are making some real Headway in that and that's over 40 percent uh in both races uh that are voting for The Republican that is a very a tough Trend uh for the Democrats to adjust to because Arizona is such a big portion of the vote what about the independent vote in Arizona well the independent vote is is most fascinating in the in the senate race if it was 0.5 apart so these guys are splitting Independence right down the middle and this is you know very much a state where people don't look at a party and that Party Loyalty is not a big thing when you think of Christian Center you think of John McCain but it's more of like a people do are more independent so that independent vote is everything in it for it to be virtually tied is something strong so we have Masters down by one the Republican candidate for Senate do you think there could be a you know a Kerry lake effect on voting Day Care Lakes got a lot of momentum she seems like she's got a pretty healthy lead could we have Carey Lake voters end up benefiting Masters yes we have a lot of Voters that are not regular voters that do just grew up watching Carrie like on TV and like her that are going to vote in this election and don't really care about politics and the odds are they're probably going to vote for the other guy on the same party so I think she's had a very positive effect for Masters and and they both kind of have the same you know I'm from the outside of me even though she's a replacing Republican Governor she's making it clear she wants to go a different direction final question so undecided we've got a fair number what four or five percent in Arizona similar to Pennsylvania where do we think undecided they're going to land on voting day well what we saw is with 56 and 55 respectively among the undecided felt uh either strongly disapproved or disapproved of the job that Biden's doing and when when you you have that kind of a strong number on that side I I don't see them voting for The the one aligned with the same party they've ended up voting against the party the president they're unhappy with once again Independence and undecided's going to decide this race absolutely thank you so much for coming on well polls are important for Trends but it's the voters who have the real power so now we turn to you the voters every week on Election why are we speak to Americans from across the country about which issues they care about the most here's what they're telling us abortion right now you know it's a big topic that we've been talking about so I live in Philadelphia crime is very important so I'll rank crime number one women's issues number two inflation number three taxes for me it's uh the economy it's uh just how badly uh the country is just losing on every front the economy the border and getting the Biden's locked up uh we we need to just put a capitalism back in in this country you know I guess you could say like abortion or like different things like that um I just think there's too many taxes right now imposed on uh United States citizens since Larry krasner was elected into office the lives of the police officers in Philadelphia has absolutely gone to garbage because of him I feel like we need to put Americans first and that's the number one thing for me I don't understand why that's wrong I'm all about giving for other people I'm very inclusive I'm nice to everyone I'm you know I think I'm kind but I feel like I don't know I I would just hope that we could put Americans first and that that's okay and it's not a bad thing it's been a disaster look at everything right look at gas prices look at the economy look at inflation they blew it they blew it the Border crisis yeah it's bad but keep sending them keep sending them to the people that that want them you know honestly I mean I kind of wish we could have like a find a good middle ground on abortion as far as like sometimes I feel like there are cases where you do need it but I don't also feel like you should just be able to go and have an abortion whenever you feel like just because I feel like that's kind of like you need to take responsibility for the things that you're doing well thank you for joining us on Election wire this episode we'll be back each week with all the election news you need to know [Music] thank you",
    "U76QY102XXY": "candidates Spar on the debate stage while making their final appeal to voters Republicans continue to win the enthusiasm Gap as early voting reaches record-breaking levels and the toss-ups whose gaining and who's losing ground with voters plus election wire speaks directly to voters about the issues they are most concerned about and we unveil our latest exclusive poll [Music] hello and welcome to election wire I'm John Bickley daily wire editor-in-chief and I'm joined by senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot will get to some of the key debate moments in a second but first a lot has happened in this last week tell us about the shifting winds with just over a week to go well by every single metric we have Republicans are in a better spot now than they were even just a week ago the winds are certainly changing now we've seen anecdotal evidence over the last month of that shift taking place right but it's now impossible to die if you look at all the hard data at the Statewide and the national level Republicans are clearly gaining ground now it's not a mystery the main reason for that is the consistent state of the economy it's not getting any better in many areas it's actually getting worse and to kind of give you an example of what that looks like and how specifically that's causing independent voters to break late towards the right the left-leaning navigator for example had a 20-point jump in the last month among independent voters saying that they are more concerned now about the economy and gas prices 20 points 20 points in a month that specifically is helping Republicans we saw the cook political report which in the past has kind of exaggerated Democrat support in polling when you see the final numbers even they published a new piece this week saying that Republicans might end up not losing a single incumbent senate seat or a single governorship so you're starting to see kind of this shift take place in the mainstream media as well where they're starting to temper expectations for Democrats as we see more and more hard data that Republicans are getting grout all right so let's jump right into these debates a big debate night Tuesday night a lot of candidates facing off in some key races we'll start with the one that everyone's been waiting for though and that's in Pennsylvania between John fetterman Mehmet Oz really a debate like we've never seen before tell us about this that is not overstating it we really haven't seen a situation like this where uh first off there were questions if it even happened in the first place fetterman suffered that stroke back before the primary his campaign team has really kept him off the trail they've kept his appearances very limited there was a lot of argument over whether this debate would happen fetterman faced a lot of Mount pressure of his team saying you got to get out there you got to make your closing pitch and within just a few minutes it was pretty obvious why they were trying to keep this debate from happening fetterman had clear signs of that stroke he had numerous moments where he just blanked and and wasn't able to finish an answer throughout the night he was clearly having problems processing the questions given to him and you can see from some of these clips just how difficult at times it was to watch I never got knocked down that had to get back up again you know I'm also fighting for any forgotten Community all across Pennsylvania's they ever got knocked down it had to be made to get back up and I've made my entire career dedicating to those kinds of Pursuits I started as a GED instructor back in in Braddock over 20 years ago because I believe it's about serving Pennsylvania not about using Pennsylvania for uh their own and interests as well to me careers are revealed uh by your real underlying values and my values have always been about fighting for forgotten communities all across Pennsylvania all right so fetterman's closing statement there and are really halting kind of difficult to watch we saw some other moments too yeah and it's worth pointing out also that was kind of the tone all night that was actually at times one of the more coherent messages we heard the other big moment that was going viral throughout the evening was on the issue of Frac keep in mind the issue of fracking in Pennsylvania is incredibly important for a lot of Voters there fetterman appeared to flip-flop saying that he actually supported fracking after earlier in his career throughout his career actually saying that he wanted to see it done away with this moment had a lot of Pennsylvania voters watching clarify something you're saying tonight that you support fracking that you've always supported fracking but there is that 2018 interview that you said quote I don't support fracking at all so how do you square the two oh I I I do support fracking and I don't I don't I support fracking and I stand and I do support fracking so another answer there kind of difficult to understand what he's saying and definitely a flip-flop from some of his past positions but there were moments that fetterman's team viewed as a victory for their campaign there was one particular answer that Dr Oz gave on abortion that's again had a lot of people talking Dr Oz seemed to imply that that politicians should be also in the decision-making process for women when it comes to getting an abortion watch that moment I want women doctors local political leaders letting the Democracy that's always allowed our nation to thrive to put the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves so that one line in there about local politicians being involved in the conversation about abortion with women and their doctors that by the next day Democrats had already put into Political ads they'd spend a million dollars on Pennsylvania and 24 hours after trying to say look Dr Oz thinks that politicians should have a say in Women's Healthcare decisions Oz's team saying no you're misconstruing what he actually meant there but regardless immediately after this debate it was viewed by virtually everyone as a clear win for Dr Oz there was one tracking poll after where 82 percent of viewers said that Dr Oz came out the clear winner and another interesting element here are the betting markets you can kind of help give you a feel for how you know the uh it's sometimes even more accurate than polls but give you a feel for where the money is going coming into the summer fetterman was a two to one favorite over odds coming into the debate it had narrowed it was about 50 50 it was even odds within the first 10 minutes of the debate going on the odds for Dr Oz shot up he he ended the debate a two to one favorite after being a two to one Underdog at the start of the summer Fleet reversal so all the money now in those markets is going towards Oz after that debate so let's move now to New York where Republican Lee zeldin was facing off against Governor Kathy hokel another debate that got a lot of attention there's a couple of key moments there tell us about that well this is another race that no one expected to be close coming out of the summer hokel had a gigantic lead over zeldon the only reason that that zeldin has pulled within low single digits right now is because of crime we know for a fact Republicans are having huge success on that issue and there was a moment during the debate result and continued bringing up crime and hokel challenged him actually on the issue of crime saying why are you bringing this up so much that had everyone talking watch they're not being represented from this this governor who still to this moment we're not what are we halfway through the debate she still hasn't talked about locking up anyone committing any crimes okay anyone who commits a crime under our laws especially with the change they made to bail has consequences I don't know why that's so important that line I don't know why that's so important to you referring to Crime that in the 24 hours afterwards was plastered all over ads online in newspapers that was the line of the debate and really that's been the line of the campaign so far keep in mind these are the kinds of moments that can that can be a turning point for a race especially a race like this where all the momentum is clearly with zeldon that can kind of push him over the edge with a lot of Voters especially in a state like New York that's been ravaged by violent crime another big moment that was getting a lot of attention was when zeldin responded to hokel she was saying that crime had only to do with guns and if you could just get the guns off the street it would fix crime zeldon wasn't having it listen but it's about getting the guns off the streets that's the first start we have more to do but I'm the one to do it did you want to respond yes yeah of course and unfortunately Kathy Holcomb believes that the only crimes that are being committed are these crimes with guns and you've got people who are afraid of being pushed in front of oncoming subway cars they're being stabbed beaten to death on the street with hammers go talk to the Asian-American community and how it's impact them with the loss of lives Jewish people targeted with raw violent anti-Semitism on our streets it just happened yet again we need to be talking about all of these other crimes but instead Kathy hogle's too busy patting herself on the back job well done no actually right now there should be a special session the state legislature should come back and they should overhaul castles bail and these other pro-criminal laws with zero tolerance but they're saying elect me she says elect me and then you'll find out where maybe I'll stand on this issue in January now there he is speaking very passionately and personally with the attacks on him about crime now the Michigan governor's race is starting to get close more people watch this debate I think than probably plan to because of the polling we've seen what happened there well you bring up the the discrepancy and polling from over the summer where the income and Gretchen Whitmer the Democrat was up 15 points at sometimes 18 in one poll now it's tightened some polls have it you know still a five or six point lead for women others have it incredibly close in a statistical tie one thing that stuck out from this debate was how Tudor dicks in the Republican was offering her message on abortion we've seen some Republican candidates on the defensive because they feel like that's been a winning issue for Democrats tutor Dixon came out on the offensive when it came to abortion have a listen the governor has the most radical opinion of abortion she was asked twice in the last debate if she had any limits on abortion she refused to answer because she has no limits on abortion so when she calls me extreme the truth is that there's no more extreme position than governor whitmer's on abortion all right so we had the candidates talk about a lot of issues but the candidates also brought up a name in a very prominent way over and over again the Republicans did at least Joe Biden now tell us about that well it's a name that's not even on the ballot but make no mistake about it Joe Biden is on the ballot this year Republicans were insistent on reminding voters essentially their message was ex candidate in this case the Democrat candidate voting for him or voting for her is just like voting for Joe Biden that's what they were trying to do many candidates were bringing up if it was a senate race saying this candidate voted this percentage of the time with Biden's agenda many candidates were pointing out this candidate is lockstep with Joe Biden so the key message from Republicans was trying to associate Democrats with Joe Biden so let's get to some of those States we want to look now at the latest polling from Key Battleground races that will decide things in November Cabot what we're looking at well what we're looking at is more good news for Republicans we'll start with the two Senate races where Republicans have really started to pull ahead after a summer where things got uncomfortably tight for them we'll go to Ohio first where JD Vance is now ahead by four points keep in mind this race was going back and forth with Democrat Tim Ryan all summer it appeared like a true toss-up you can sort of View Ohio right now as more of a liens Republican as opposed to a traditional toss-up that's the same situation out in Wisconsin where incumbent Senator Ron Johnson had been facing an unexpectedly tight race from Democrat Challenger Mandela Barnes there were a number of polls over the summer and even into the early fall where Barnes was ahead by one to two even three points but the latest polling has Ron Johnson now with a five-point lead and every poll you look at it's very clear right now that Ron Johnson the incumbent Republican is in the driver's seat in Wisconsin so in those two states States Republicans are kind of breathing a little easier because those are going to be vital States for them to pick up if they're going to get to 51. we'll head out west now to Arizona where it is more of a traditional toss-up race now that's still good news for Republicans because early on in the summer it was a lean Democrat or even likely Democrat race there with the incumbent Mark Kelly he had a clear fundraising Advantage he had clear name recognition Advantage but right now Blake Masters is gaining ground and gaining ground fast some polls have it all tied up other polls out for falger latest has him within two points all the momentum right now lies with Republicans in Arizona and speaking of Republicans there it's important to look at another Republican race the governor's race where Kerry lake is pulling ahead from the Democrat Katie Hobbs she is now up convincingly anywhere from four to even 11 points in some polls and that is having sort of a coattail effect where Blake Masters is benefiting from the popularity of lake and a lot of Republicans are saying hey if Carrie Lake wins by six to ten points she's got to help down the ballot with someone like Blake Masters who may not be as popular with the Republican base right now so Republicans they're very confident and Kerry Lake for her part is doing everything she can to help Masters every single event she has she's shouting him out telling her audience go vote for Blake Masters we're seeing campaign signs across the state that say vote Blake and vote Lake we're not seeing that type of unity with the Democrats Hobbs in the governor's race and Mark Kelly in the Democrat Senate race we're not seeing them Campaign together we're not seeing them cut ads together so clearly more Unity on the Republican side in Arizona that is a big benefit in a race this close do not ignore how much of an impact carry Lake could have on the senate race there going up now to Oregon another governor's race that people weren't expecting to be as close but there could be a republican governor in Oregon come November for the first time in 40 years that's the longest drought that we've seen in the entire country but one thing that we're seeing is things are getting tighter between the Democrat and Republican candidates as the independent candidate Betsy Johnson who had been around around 20 percent in most polls she's now dropped down to about 10 to 12 percent and most of that or most of her supporters have now gone to the Democrat Tina kotec So Christine Drazen is now up by 1.2 points in some other polls it's very close she does still have the lead but Democrats are closing fast so now the final question remains how much support does Betsy Johnson keep up until election day and if more of her supporters drop off do they go to the Democrats or do they simply not vote so keep an eye on Oregon one other interesting nugget there Nike founder Phil Knight has now donated another 1.5 million dollars to the Republican Christine Drazen bringing his total to three million dollars in the state he wants Republicans or at least not Democrats in control of the state where Nike's headquarters are and then finally we go to Michigan where the governor's race there between Republican Tudor Dixon and Democrat Gretchen Whitmer the incumbent is again unexpectedly close some of the latest polls have Whitmer up six points but others like our partners at Trafalgar have it as a statistical tie regardless of how you look at it the clear Advantage right now or clear the momentum I should say is going for Tudor Dixon something you'd expect to see continue after that strong debate performance that she had but keep an eye on Michigan there could be a red wave coming to Michigan to Oregon to states that we weren't really expecting to see but good news for Republicans right now they've got the momentum joining us now to release another exclusive poll is Robert kahali founder of Trafalgar group one of the most trusted pollsters in the industry Robert this week you pulled the voters of Georgia where we have Democrat Senator Rafael Warnock that's the incumbent being challenged by Republican Herschel Walker this is a really incredible shift what did you find oh we found that Walker's now up by two where he was down by two of the last one at 49-47 and what's interesting is uh before the other one happened all before the debate uh and the other two polls at the same time Emerson and The Insider Advantage both two percent and three percent respectfully um where they were all of us together at an average of just a little over two percent down and so this is a major shift from the debate it was one immediately following the debate they had them that even and this is the first Advantage for Walker but it seems to be all based on the debate and the and the the shifting of things that happened after the debate where the Warnock was kind of put on the spot about the you know quote unquote slumlord accusations that he and the church owned the property uh that have was evicting people for under a hundred dollars while the church pet was paying him a seven thousand dollar a month housing um bonus and so it it really kind of shifted things the debate performance Herschel kind of held his own in a way that no one will expected him to right you know going into that Herschel Walker there's a lot of questions about how he would hold up in the debate and I think a lot of people were impressed and he said a lot a lot of the viral moments from that were Herschel Walker responding so it was actually focused on a positive moment for Walker and I think the perception there is that he did win or at least come out sort of even in that debate and that's exactly right because a lot of people who didn't see the debate only saw what you just said kind of those viral moments from it and that is their you know how they feel about the entire debate and some of his answers uh constantly uh the way he dealt with the pro-life question and talked about abortions in the city of Atlanta the way he uh constantly tied things back dividing by my account he referred Walker referred to Biden 37 times and you know tying we're not dividend is the way to win the election that I think I've said that from her beginning Robert you mentioned Walker is at 49 that's an important number because of the quirk in Georgia where a candidate must get to 50 to avoid a runoff do you think that either of these candidates is in a position where they'll be able to get to that 50 Mark absolutely uh Walker's 49 uh is essentially you know 48.9 rounded up to 49 so that's 1.1 away from 50 and it's 50 plus one so that's not a very hard to heal to climb at this point so it's completely possible uh that Walker can take this momentum and turn it into a possible Victory without a runoff let's move to the governor's race where we have Democrats Stacy Abrams challenging incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp Kemp's lead is seems to be holding correct yeah according to our numbers is this seven point area has been where Kent's been uh for a while um I really continue to be shocked about how bad campaign that Ames Abrams is running I mean I personally have always thought she was very very clever and one of the smartest people in the political space in Georgia so it really is surprising to me some of the missteps that she's made as a candidate interesting thing when you look at when you kind of dig into these numbers is it both uh camp and uh Herschel are over 20 of the black vote and that is just just Earth shattering this point because we also know that a lot of those uh African-American voters tend to be a little hesitant to say they're voting for Republicans so if this 20 who will say so and Hirsch was a little higher at 23. I think that vote could be even stronger but it's just devastating uh for Abrams that she could have that kind of percentage happening yeah that's more than double that we're used to seeing nationally speaking in terms of the black vote for Republicans Abram seems to be having a bad news cycle too with a report that her campaign manager collected millions of dollars from Abram's voting rights organization are you seeing any movement on that front you know that's that's one of those stories that's been reported a lot in conservative media but it really hasn't made the mainstream there's a mainstream wall uh especially that circles the city of Atlanta when it comes to uh negative press on Warren on the car Abrams and and they just can't get over that wall uh outside of some conservative news outlets so no I really don't see it happen that big of an impact at this point and we're we're the Silly Season at to the point where any accusation against either candidate is seen with the suspicion that accusations in late October November automatically come with well Robert we just have two weeks to go we're gonna have another poll next week that we unveil in this show great to have you back on thanks for joining us absolutely thanks every week on Election why are we showcase the voices of Voters across the country here's what Americans are concerned about today [Music] I'd say inflation cost of living versus wage like the average wage first cost of living uh probably the economy when it came down to like the vaccine mandates you know part of my family's vaccinated part of us is not but I'm just like people need to have a right to choose the homeless issue again Fresno is not huge but anytime you go towards La or San Francisco I mean it's just you know even in Fresno we watch it creep up farther and farther into more affluent neighborhoods and uh it's I mean it's it's been real tough to deal with and I didn't want to have my child get the vaccine as a five-year-old luckily the parents spoke up and we voted it out and we got the school district to not do that same thing with the mass my daughter was the only child in the entire kindergarten in her school with a mask exemption I mean nobody's going to teach my child about sex or you know I don't care if it's same-sex or heterosexual sex it's sex my I can teach my kid that at home look at the unemployment rate uh look at the track look at the um the jobs that um the job availability always good to hear directly from voters that's it for this episode of election wire we'll be back next week with all the election news you need to know [Music]",

we going to call it Terry Zona Arizona is the most hotly contested state in the midterm elections longtime news anchor and first-time gubernatorial candidate Kerry lake has been painted by the national media as the face of election denial I wanted to get an inside perspective on the Cary Lake phenomenon so I flew out to Phoenix to hear from Carrie herself and Arizona voters they all claim that we're we're domestic terrorists they were calling me saying that we're spreading white supremacy views wait till I'm the son of Syrian immigrants and I look around here look at this America is Unum out of many one right [Music] when I walk into the floor of the United States Senate I walk into the most narrowly divided United States Senate we've had in U.S history over this duration it's 50 50. when the Senate is tied 50 50 who breaks the tide the vice president comes down and breaks the timing Harris has broken more ties than all but two vice presidents in our nation we've had 40 40 vice presidents in our nation's history rather than having Kamala Harris break the ties how about we elect Blake Masters [Applause] that's the best you can do but I think it's gonna work I mean it's his future their future my granddaughter's future that's at stake now the Border The Reckless spending the fentanyl is outrageous out of hand it's worse than heroin it's worse than half the drugs that have ever come in you need to start Prosecuting these people instead of letting them out of jail and close the border they need to close the border it's ridiculous it needs to change and these four are going to do it yeah in my community here we don't have no rehabilitation centers Democrats have told us for so many years of what they promised us and what they was going to do year after year election after election we hear the same thing no change no action the crime here is high our Police Department is down 500 police officer the other day I had a break-in at my restaurant I called the police they told me it was going to take two to three hours to come out no we need more police in the community and it is a lie that Hispanic and Blackstone want police officers I'm from Dominican Republic I'm not immigrant I'm a black woman Hispanic in all the nine yards and we won police officers so when they label saying the Hispanic and black don't want police officers that's creating division that is the life things are going on that is the most important thing get us in there let's see you soon why pause my successful business career because I saw what Joe Biden and Mark Kelly were doing to this country right I am a father of three young boys they're eight six and two I've worked hard I've succeeded in some relative since my boys will be fine right I've been uh you know blessed but in an absolute sense like what kind of country are these boys on track to grow up in right I want everybody's kids and grandkids to actually live in a country that works and in America that we still recognize well Biden Mark Kelly they're taking that away from us what are your main priorities going to be day one in the Senate stop inflation and secure the Border okay so when you say stop inflation what would be the steps to do that well just by winning right just by getting the house and the Senate back we can immediately put the brakes on Biden's inflation right again they threw open our Southern border they welcome 300 000 illegal immigrants every month it's not just the people the Fentanyl we're losing a hundred thousand people mostly Young Americans every year to fentanyl those numbers are just going way up Mark Kelly he's not doing a damn thing to stop it makes me sick it's killing our kids so as soon as we secure that border and stop inflation we have to meaningfully restrain big Tech I understand big Tech better than any other candidate actually better than any singing Senator right now call me old-fashioned I think the American people should determine who the president's going to be not Google not Facebook not multi-billion dollar multinational corporations Kerry Lake was a local anchor in Arizona for decades she resigned in 2021 with a viral video denouncing what she described as corruption in the news media an endorsement from Donald Trump in September of 2021 propelled her to victory in the GOP Primary since then she's become the target of the media machine she was once part of [Applause] hello Arizona [Applause] [Music] I can't tell you how good that makes me feel Weevil I know we've all been working hard 520 two days I swear I'm not counting on the campaign Trail 522 days across this gorgeous State meeting with the most amazing people that I could ever dream of of working for it's been such a blessing from God I can't even describe it any other way to be face to face with people and they know me I feel that I know them as well I've been in their homes for 27 years as a fair and honest journalist and news anchor and now it's been wonderful to reconnect with the people face to face and talk about the issues that are affecting their lives I want to tell you what I want to do for Arizona and I think after 520 . take back the material Down On the Border that we pay for and we're going to finish president Trump's wall who's for that [Applause] we have a border that's wide open fentanyl pouring in killing 100 000 young people and next year probably more elections that are corrupt and have issues have serious consequences and we can't just look the other way and act like that didn't happen you've got to go in there you've got to Mark Republic and write down and then go outside but I vow to you when I take office we will reform our elections and restore honest transparent elections we know there were major problems we had a forensic audit the media doesn't want to cover that audit but when I go out to events and I ask people do you want reforms to your elections so that you know on Election night the results the crowd goes crazy people want election reform that leads to transparent fair and honest elections and we're going to bring that everything is on the line Tuesday yeah I cannot say that enough what happens in Arizona is either going to save this country or we're going to go into ruins we have to get out and vote like our lives depend on it get up early bring some food bring some water bring a like-minded friend and don't get out of line until you cast your vote who's ready to do that oh it's dark as it seems right now I believe that with our policies and the people behind us our greatest and best days are ahead I think America's watching us because they have felt very despondent the last couple of years they've been every time they speak out and try to point out what's going wrong or an issue they get canceled online then you have a candidate like me standing up and saying you don't have to be quiet Once you walk through fear and got to the other side you're like he's just not afraid of anything there's a definite palpable something happening in Arizona and I think it's spreading across the country and if I'm just a small part of it I'm thrilled about that",
    "7ArBOzBgA0k": "with three weeks to go into election day we turn our Focus to the governor's races which states could flip which are toss-ups and what are the issues motivating voters there's a lot of fentanyl that's coming over our borders right plus who's really ahead in the Pennsylvania Senate race we'll release daily wire's exclusive poll right here with our a-rated pollster [Music] hello and welcome to election wire I'm John Bickley daily wire editor-in-chief with senior editor Cabot Phillips hey Cabot hey John the countdown continues last week we focused on the Senate toss-ups today we'll break down the most important gubernatorial contest all right Cabot first which states are in play with the governor's races well I'm very glad we're talking about these states because it's easy to only get caught up in the federal elections but keep in mind for a lot of Voters at home Governor's elections end up impacting them throughout the year a lot more who's in office there impacts people a lot more and so right now there are it's important to kind of zoom out and look at the the national stage first Republicans currently hold 28 of 50 Governors Mansions Nationwide but they're very optimistic that that number is going to be a lot higher come November and frankly they have good reason to feel that way the map certainly favors them this year of the 36 total governors race that's going on Nationwide if you look at the 10 closest races the 10 toss-ups get this nine of them are currently held by democrats so Democrats are really going to be on the defensive right now because they are in the most vulnerable States and it's also worth pointing out the only of those 10 toss-ups held by a republican right now it's Governor Doug Ducey in Arizona and Arizona Republicans they're pretty confident right now in Cary Lake that race getting a lot of attention for them yes so Arizona let's start there let's look at that Governor's rights it's getting a lot of attention nationally what's the latest on that well it's getting a lot of attention for good reason because this is probably the closest race that we've seen Nationwide over the last month for example we've got six polls that show Kerry lake with the lead you've got five that show her Democrat opponent Katie Hobbs with the lead you've got two where they are in a complete tie so everyone's looking at Arizona because this is a spot where Democrats are hoping to get one pickup they don't have a ton of opportunities for picking up Governor's offices this is one of their chances Hobbs is a former social worker she's got a long history of experience in the state she's been in local politics for about 20 years there but the big hit from Democrats themselves they're they're talking off the Record now they're starting to say well we wish you would campaign more she's not exactly the most exciting speaker and then there's the independent vote right that is going to be key in Arizona it's important everywhere but in a state like Arizona especially that's because of voter registration the uh the breakdown between the two parties right now there are 1.3 million registered Republicans only 1.28 million registered Democrats that means if a democrat's going to win a Statewide election they're going to have to peel off a few Republicans and if they can't do that they're going to have to peel off a whole lot of Independence a third of the state it is registered as independent so you're going to have to win overwhelmingly as a Democrat and and Katie Hobbs that's the big question for can she go out and do that she hasn't really been on the trail as much as Carrie lake has now one of the ways she could appeal to a broader voting base might be the debate but there's actually been an issue there right to debate so she will not debate Carrie late now Carrie Lake says it's because she doesn't want to talk about the issues it's because she knows that that and you know in her words she's going to get beaten in the debate but Hobbs team has said it's because Carrie Lake would turn it into a spectacle and they don't want to dignify her with a debate but regardless of what her reasons are the Optics are not good for hops not just that Lake's team can say look she doesn't want to defend herself in front of the voters but also because there was a debate scheduled earlier Hobbes did not show up she refused Lake went ahead and showed up and they had the debate they televised it throughout the state with two podiums Carrie Lake stood in front of her Podium she answered questions for the full hour there was an empty Podium there which really highlighted the fact for a lot of Voters that Hobbs didn't want to talk and one more interesting nuggets during the primary Hobbes also did not agree to a debate with her main primary opponent so whatever her reasons are for not doing it Lake's team is saying look she won't debate anybody and and that clearly seems to be having an impact especially if you want to win over Independence what are some of the key issues that are driving voters in Arizona the economy obviously is is one of the key issues there as it is everywhere you're not going to find a state where that's not one of the top one or two issues but in Arizona as you might imagine it's immigration because they are a border state because they've particularly been overwhelmed by this migrant crisis millions of people crossing the border Carey lake has made that a key issue for her campaign and on that immigration point we we've reached out to both campaigns to get their take on what they would do if elected Hobbs team has not yet responded Lake was more than willing to talk and she actually spoke to us exclusively about her plans what she would do on immigration if she took office we're taking the matter into our own hands we are invoking our article one section 10 powers in the U.S Constitution to do that starting on day one I'm declaring an invasion I'm issuing a declaration of an invasion on day one we're going to start sending troops to the Border in key areas where people are coming across and we're going to stop people from coming across a strong words from Kerry Lake there in a very aggressive plan on immigration so we want to get next to a race that no one thought would be a race at all it's New York State's Governor's race we've got incumbent Kathy hokel facing off against Lee zeldin the Republican and it's a real contest now right yeah I think a lot of people a year ago would be shocked to find out that we were even tracking this race zeldin is now within two points in the latest Trafalgar polling wow in past elections Democrats have won by 15 20 even 25 points in Statewide elections but there are a few things really going in Republicans favor first off is disgrace Governor Andrew Cuomo when he stepped down Kathy hokel was in many ways sort of his number two in Statewide politics for the Democrats she has tried very hard to distance herself from Cuomo the other main issue that's helping Republicans is crime news Eldon has completely honed in on that as his main issue pointing out that crime is horrible in New York not only in New York City but throughout the rest of the state he has pointed out that since Democrats took power we've seen a clear rise in violent crime rates especially and he's actually been the victim of some of that crime yeah the attack on his house let's talk about that that was a major moment that happened this last week what happened there and how does that impact the race well this is certainly something that can impact a race because it really highlights exactly what Lee zeldon's talking about so he and his wife were the Columbus Day Parade just earlier this month his two 16 year old daughters were at home doing homework they started hearing shooting outside they ran locked themselves in the bathroom called 9-1-1 there were two young men that were shot on zeldin's property that were hiding in some bushes under a deck trying to get away from the shooters and zeldin obviously rushed home that one of the bullets landed about 20 feet away from zeldon's daughters they both were okay but again this highlights exactly what zeldin has been talking about and it's not the only example of crime really touching zeldon in a personal way he was giving a campaign event over the summer he's up on stage a crazed man comes up on stage tries to attack him watch the video of that moment if you haven't it's a very scary thing to see there's only one option thank you [Music] really disturbing footage there very scary stuff and one thing that was just as disturbing for zeldon especially in a lot of people in New York is that the assailant in this case was actually let out in bond later the next day and this is something Republicans have consistently talked about they've said look too many violent criminals are left out on the streets because of democrat policies on Criminal Justice Reform and when you've got a candidate attacked and then you see that policy taking place and and the effect of it it really does Galvanize a lot of Voters in the state and make this into a personal issue for people and that does seem to have been sort of a turning point in the election in many ways all right so let's shift South to Georgia where we have another closely watched race that features incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp facing off against Democrats Stacy Abrams what's the latest in this race well the senate race they're obviously getting an incredible amount of attention the governor's race not as much attention even though you've got The Narrative of this being a repeat of the 28 18 race at the big rematch their big rematch where Kemp won back in 2018 this time he's opened up a serious lead Republicans are very confident he's going to win there and this is an example of different strategies from Democrats so in the senate race Rafael Warnock he's trying to Galvanize a lot of independent support he's very open about the fact that he wants moderate Republicans to vote for him he hasn't exactly tried to court the far left Progressive base in Georgia Abrams on the other hand she has made this all about progressivism and far left policies she has really dived dove in trying to Galvanize in her words the progressive base the problem in a state like Georgia that's been purple recently and deep red even as recently as 10 years ago there's not a huge Progressive base there and so that seems to be one reason that camp has opened up such a wide lead over Abrams and Abrams already lost the governor's race four years ago right and that's another interesting point here she has Statewide name recognition a lot of times in a race like this you're really just trying to get your name out there everyone in Georgia knows who Stacy Abrams is and on a nationwide scale they know as well and some Democrats have been hesitant to support her hesitant to pour too much money into her race because of the way she reacted to the 2018 race you might remember she refused to concede defeat she went on calling herself the rightful governor of Georgia she went on you know denying the election results which a lot of people have pointed to the way she reacted from 2018 to 2020 there but there have also been questions about her fundraising what she's been doing with money that she claimed to be using for voter turnout um and a non-profit That was supposed to be registering voters there in Georgia so there are some lingering questions there but Abrams is struggling right now um and and this is a race we're going to watch obviously there's room to change but Republicans are confident in Georgia all right so that's what's happening in Georgia let's go out to Oregon where we've got another very surprising race kind of like the New York race no one thought this would be competitive there's a reason this race is competitive we've got actually three candidates here Democrat Tina kotec Republican Christine Drazen and independent Betsy Johnson how's the this shaken out well this is one of my favorite races and it's something really that no one was expecting if you would have told people recently that there could be a republican governor in Oregon Oregon a state that that has not gone for uh they've not had a republican governor in over three decades not exactly a republican Bastion right now the Republican there Christine Drazen she's polling in the mid 30s all the way up to the high 30s which might not sound like enough to win the race but there are three serious candidates on the ballot as you mentioned earlier the Democrat Tina kotec she's polling in the low 30s to mid 30s but the key candidate that's shifting this race is Betsy Johnson independent candidate she's been in Oregon politics for 20 30 years but the key Point here she was serving an office as a Democrat and so in a state like Oregon where the electorate is overwhelmingly Democrat and you've got two candidates pulling over 20 percent sure she's going to draw that vote exactly it's going to benefit Republicans and so she's insisted that she will not be dropping out she's uh you know she said things that have tried to appeal to The Republic looking base she said things like Oregon has gone woke we need to bring it back but also on her on policies she is a pretty standard Democrat candidate now the thing hurting Democrats in Oregon is the fact that their nominee Tina kotec has been in State House or been in state politics for for years now it's her association with the governor Kate Brown Kate Brown the Democrat incumbent is she's not on the ballot this year but she is the least popular governor in all of America based on unfavorability ratings and she's really viewed Tina kotec as Kate Brown's right-hand person she's been the Speaker of the House in Oregon for a long time that association with the unpopular Kate Brown has really played a role in her struggling and so in this race really the magic number could be 37 38 and you could see a republican taking office in Oregon not something you'd expect to see a few years ago now we turn to our pivot point where we look at Key moments that could alter the political landscape our cap at the first of this episode's pivot Points involves Governor Ronda Santos and Joe Biden yeah tell us about this so down in Florida President Biden visited uh victims of hurricane Ian he had some very very interesting comments to say about Governor DeSantis and his ability to help get Aid to those in need have a listen what the governor's done is pretty remarkable so far not the sort of comments you might expect from Joe Biden about no Rhonda Santos especially when you keep in mind that Democrats have been trying to paint DeSantis so far who remember is up for re-election and in a race that's not a cakewalk they try to paint him as an extremist and as a fascist Statewide Democrats there in Florida have tried to say that DeSantis has not done enough to help victims in need of the hurricane DeSantis team has said that's ridiculous that's just politics and here's Biden really blowing up that narrative exactly you've got the leader of the Democrat Party stepping in and saying actually this DeSantis guy's done a really good job that is going to be something that DeSantis team benefits from especially in a place like Florida where disaster responsiveness is a huge issue for campaigns you know and that's the kind of political moment that could have long-term you know implications for DeSantis who's seen as really a front-runner for 2024 presidential bid expect to hear that again if he does run yeah for sure flipping it back to you now John what's your pivot point yeah so this is uh the Pennsylvania Senate race fetterman hasn't given a sit-down in-person interview since he had his stroke and there's been lots of questions if he could even do that he's been really sort of ducking the debate finally agreed to a debate last second October 25th he finally sat down with an NBC reporter and it did not go well take a look because of his stroke veterans campaign required closed captioning technology for this interview to essentially read our questions as we ask them and Lester in small talk before the interview without captioning it wasn't clear he was understanding our conversation yeah so there you have a sympathetic crew try to really work with him he really struggled for an in-person interview he's got a debate coming up is he going to be able to handle that this is the first time I think we've seen this much much exposure to his mental health issue one thing one thing also worth pointing out that NBC reporter was actually attacked by many on the left for people saying that it was ableist of them to question whether that he was you know cognitively fit to serve as a senator people saying you can't ask questions about that it's wrong some people even saying this is the equivalent of calling out someone for needing a wheelchair the honest campaign is saying this is a legitimate question to ask are you mentally fit to be a senator don't expect this issue to go away but interesting to see the Democrat response shift from nothing is wrong to now do not ask questions and even that blowback just gives it more attention so that is clearly a potential pivot point in this risk all right so before we get to some exclusive polling updates we want to follow up on some of the Senate Battleground races we touched on last week Cabot if you could bring us up to speed we'll start with Georgia there's the key race there between Republican Herschel walk worker and Democrat Rafael Warnock we're finally starting to get our first look at polling after that bombshell story came out from The Daily Beast alleging that Herschel Walker had paid for an abortion for an ex-girlfriend now a lot of Democrats in the state had hoped that that would be the end of the Walker campaign but all three polls that we've seen since that story came out showed that the race is just as tight as ever all three poles are within three points one poll from the AJC actually has the race at a statistical tie so Georgia just as close as ever we'll shift next to Ohio the latest polling there shows JD Vance the Republican with a two-point lead over the Democrat Tim Ryan now there was just a a key debate that a lot of people were waiting to see so we're going to wait to see if there's any sort of polling shift that happens after that debate both candidates uh you know seem to hold their ground pretty well a lot of people online in the media saying that Vance appeared to come out with the upper hand but again we'll have to see how voters respond to that one now to Wisconsin where the Republican Ron Johnson the incumbent is starting to pull away from the Democrat Mandel Barnes the new poll that everyone's talking about it comes from Marquette which is one of the kind of establishment polls in Wisconsin they had Ron Johnson up six points that same poll last month had him up just one point so the key poll there in Wisconsin showing Ron Johnson with some clear momentum now heading out west to Nevada stop me if you've heard this before this race is also neck and neck between Republican Adam black salt and Democrat incumbent Catherine Cortez masto the latest polling from CNN has lacked salt with a two-point lead but it's worth pointing out there has been other polls there have been other polls in the last few weeks that have shown Cortez masto with the lead really it's it's the definition of a toss-up every poll seems to be showing something different still Incredibly Close and finally we have the state of Pennsylvania but for this one we've got something very special joining us in person in studio is Mr Robert kahaly founder of the Trafalgar group hey Robert good to have you here in person this time so we announced our partnership last week we're doing a number of polls with you guys exclusive polls this is our first one we're excited about it it's a big poll it's Pennsylvania let's start right from the top we've got the biggest race in Pennsylvania everyone's watching Dr Mehmet Oz versus John fetterman what have we learned well what we've learned this race continues to tighten the real clear politics average going into this bowl was 3.7 with Emerson coming in just in the last couple days with a two two percent and Insider Advantage women three percent and so we're showing a 2.4 which around to 2 percent and with Oz at 44.8 and betterment at 47.2 this continues just to stay tight and we're seeing some separation in the governor's race but this one continues to be just kind of a dog fight with a lot of issues that are significant especially crime as people learn more about uh fetterman's record on crime and Veteran support for uh you know legalization of drugs it's becoming a bigger problem in the race so we you have a 2.4 gap between the two and a month ago you had something similar Trafalgar found something similar but as you mentioned a lot of the polls said no this is an 8 to 10 point gap and you were arguing hey look this is this is always close uh but here we are as you mentioned 2.4 and a couple other polls now showing yeah this is this is a really tight race one of the things I was interested in is there's a lot of undecideds in this race can you talk about that well we have a good bit of Underside 704 percent we also have uh over three percent 3.4 for the libertarian now a lot of the times those people don't end up staying there uh they and the undecideds at this point most of the undecided have a negative opinion of Biden so I don't really see them breaking uh toward a fetterman so I think that you'll see probably a few as always do follow off the uh libertarian and end up with the Republican and then I think there's a good chance that they uh right now the way things are set is Oz is going to pick up more of the undecided to the veteran now when we drill down into the specifics of the demo Graphics do we see anything interesting in this race that's one thing we felt was very interesting is Oz all the Republicans this year are doing very well with black voters but Oz is doing better than most uh over 30 percent and that is in large part because Oz unlike everybody else is doing significantly well with black women he's over 25 percent with him and so yeah that is a that is a significant outlier and it may have something to do with this you know talk you know being on talk shows all the time but uh yeah a lot of people have gotten to know him outside of politics and it's hard to demonize somebody that you've seen on TV and you just like we're going to get into some more of the issues that are really driving this race on next week's episode but right now what are the key issues for voters in Pennsylvania what have you found in the field absolutely the some of the big issues are just anywhere else uh crime the inflation you know an overall sense of there's an out of control uh this this this Wawa incident really has galvanized folks it it would you know Lee out what it would call that a defining moment but I think that's really kind of just exactly what's going on the bunch of teenagers could just run in there and just act like that and did it because they didn't really fear reprisals they didn't really fear any punishment that that kind of environment is driving a lot of Voters that don't consider themselves Republicans just to vote against who's in charge now well we're four weeks out do you see Meadows pulling this one off I think it's completely completely possible that he can do that so the only debate that's taking place between these two the only that fetterman has agreed to will not be happening until October 25th right before the election early voting has already started and it will have continued before that how much of an impact do you expect that to have on things light deciders don't tend to be early voters that you know those things don't go together so I think it will have an impact uh I think it'll be a sizable impact so it and look to see these polls continue to tighten I mean all the nonsense of trying to separate that this race was a a huge gap or falling away and now that they're having to admit the reality to avoid being embarrassed again I think they'll all start Titan Robert thank you for joining us thank you polls and pundits get a lot of attention but it's the voice of the voters that matter the most every week election wire will speak to voters from across the country about the issues important to them take a look [Music] well I think fentanyl is number one for me obviously the economy and then crime and those would be the most two that I'm most very concerned about yet no doubt the Border inflation yes I would say the electrical cars they're pissing me off and also inflation as well I mean I'm not made out of money I don't think anybody is right now it's a free fall of stored stolen cars and they just it's 14 year olds 15 year olds they steal them they let them go they never really get prosecuted they catch people and they're released within an hour 6 . securing the border so rugs and anything else that's coming across that legal doesn't come across well there's a lot of fentanyl that's coming over our borders right now and unfortunately it's killing a lot of people and now they're making it in all different colors and it and it's you know attractive to children because of that and it's really a shame I mean you can find it in almost every drug nowadays and um I mean it'll just it'll just kill you dead you know let's talk about how that's going to affect the economy let's talk about how this is going to affect neighborhoods people that kind of thing there's not enough batteries technology to cover that many electrical cars you can't do away with gas cars you can't I mean think about it you go anywhere and everything is through the roof I mean I used to go grocery shopping and you know maybe I would spend 150 200 for the household it's now double that I'm losing money because the government is spending too much money and uh they're not securing the Border crime just because when I think of you know if I have kids and I have a family and I think it might it's even we're even seeing worse crime up in the suburbs so it's not just a major you know Philly Philadelphia thing or major city thing so just based on crime and in the economy you know it's we all like making more money and you're not making a lot more inflation is going up you're doing worse Biden we just needs someone younger ever since Joe Biden came to office Americans have suffered I think Joe could be doing a lot more than he's doing well look where we're at I can't stand having Joe Biden as a president because I don't feel safe there's got to be younger more vibrant people that are more charismatic better ideas higher energy just everything I miss all of the terrific stuff that Trump was doing um he's not addressing a lot of the issues you know I I mean economy-wise things aren't good as dick said everything is through the roof money-wise you know gas is crazy everything is expensive I just think that people hated Trump because they thought he was so mean and all these different things and I really don't care if our president's mean because he got things done and there weren't Wars and there weren't things going on while he was President because people were too scared to mess with him and I would rather have a president that wrote mean things that hurt people's feelings but ran our country like a business always fascinating to hear from voters across the country that's a wrap for this episode thanks for joining us on Election wire this week we'll be back next week to bring you the election news you need to know [Music]",
    "x1bdVynwSaI": "election day is just one month away which races will tip the scale and how accurate is election polling and can Americans trust it we speak to an expert who gets it right early on they were saying that Pennsylvania was in double digits it was never double digits they were creating a false narrative and now as they face the possibility of being very wrong again they're adjusting [Music] thank you hello I'm John Bickley daily wire editor-in-chief the countdown begins with four weeks to go before midterm elections we're turning our Focus now to the races and issues that will decide the balance of power in Washington whether you've been following the races all year or just tuning in we've got you covered joining me now is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Hey Kevin good to be here later we'll talk to the founder of Trafalgar polling Group which has been one of the most accurate polling Outlets over the last few Cycles on why the polls have been so wrong and how they should be viewed this year but first Cabot can you get us up to speed where things stand now so we've got a number of important Governor's races obviously the Senate is hotly contested right now it's down the middle of 50 50. bounce power is there but we'll start with the House Republicans are very confident right now that they're going to have success in taking the house they only need to have five net seats picked up to have the majority and remember on average the party that's not in power at midterms gains 26 seats that's in a normal cycle they only need to gain five right now so Republicans are very up optimistic about their chances in the house right but the Senate is a very different situation the Senate is a different situation there's there's a lot of optimism initially with the red tsunami a red tsunami is is really what people are predicting but then all of that shifted in the summer we talked on the show quite a bit about how after the Dobbs ruling overturning Roe v Wade Democrats got a clear bump in the polls every single poll in every key State showed that Democrat candidates got a clear enthusiasm bump their candidates started to perform better especially among Suburban Women Voters which are very important in midterm races so get this Democrats they put all their eggs in the abortion basket they spent 125 million dollars on advertisements focused on abortion that is 20 times more than they spent on abortion related advertisements in 2018 the last midterms all right let's get right to it and start with the Battleground state that probably is getting the most national attention right now it's Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania we have Republican Dr Mehmet Oz facing off against Democrat John Federman Pennsylvania not only has the most Nationwide attention but they're also getting the most money almost 90 million dollars has been spent in the race for Pennsylvania's open senate seat it kind of gives you an idea of how both parties understand just how important the state is if they want to take the majority in the Senate the race has shifted a lot so right after the primaries fetterman the Democrat had a notable Advantage he was up anywhere from 10 11 even 12 points in some polls but just in the last month we've seen that completely reverse we've seen poll after poll showing Oz creeping within seven points and then five we even have polls now showing him within two points but all of them are within that four to two point range it's no question right now that Oz has the momentum what's behind that shift the economy right now Republicans they had just have more trust with voters there was a Washington Post ABC poll recently where Republicans had a 17-point Advantage when voters were asked which party they trusted more with the economy we saw another poll from Gallup this week where they had a 10-point lead with voters on that issue so when Republicans are holding an advantage on that top issue obviously you're going to see them start to make some improvements and they're also is the issue of fetterman himself the Oz campaign has had success in hitting him as being solved on crime and also hitting him on as being you know not suited to lead the state in the Senate and then there's also the health issues that have come up repeatedly even from mainstream outlets now starting to focus on this being a real problem during the primary season right before election day for the primary fetterman suffered the stroke as you'll remember now he stayed off the trail for a while all his campaign was you know sending out alerts saying that he was doing fine he was making a full recovery that his doctors had cleared him for all campaigning but when he came back on the campaign Trail it was a different John fetterman that people were seeing if you say you think the word of deal worker what is wrong with demanding for an easy safe kind of their income a path to a safe place for them to win or excuse me to work some of that footage is hard to watch and you can see why he's been reluctant to agree to a debate he has agreed now to a date of October 25th to debate Oz yeah and one thing worth pointing out early voting in Pennsylvania would have already started before that and so the the Alice campaign is saying hey you're delaying this thing way too long they're saying if you're really recovered if you're really confident in your ability right now why won't you debate us so that's something to keep an eye on if they stick to that October 25th date but the fact that voting starts before that is consequential all right let's turn to the senate race in Nevada which pits Republican Adam lacks salt against Democrat incumbent Catherine Cortez masto Republicans have another close eye on Nevada because it's a state where they can pick up a seat the Democrat incumbent there Cortez masto has started to to falter which is kind of surprising because Nevada has been reliably blue in the last two presidential elections but Republicans they don't just have a chance to pick up a senate seat we'll get to the senate in a second they have a chance for a Clean Sweep at all the elections three of the four members of Congress Nevada are Democrats all three of them appear vulnerable right now in polling which Republicans are absolutely thrilled about there's also the governor's race there which Republicans came out of nowhere to make a very tight race and then you've got the senate race so you could be looking at a situation right now where Republicans take all four House Seats the governor's office and have uh you know success in the senate race there which would be huge so a potential sea change there what's driving that well Republicans have found a lot of success with two main issues the economy and covet now obviously the economy is important everywhere inflation is is hitting Americans everywhere and there's also covet now coven this is interesting it is interesting so you would think that covet is not really playing a factor anymore that everyone's sort of moved on even President Biden said that the pandemic is over but Nevada was hit in a very unique Way by coveted lockdowns keep in mind so much of their economy is is centered on tourism on on casinos and on events and people visiting the state that was an industry that was absolutely destined donated by lockdowns and Republicans have had a lot of success in their messaging and saying look who locked the state down who kept tourists out who shut these casinos and these businesses down that is a message that is resonating in Nevada more than a lot of other states and so that's one reason why a lot of candidates are ignoring kovid in Nevada they're not they're they're reminding people of who was doing what during the pandemic all right so let's head to the Midwest and look at the Wisconsin race we have Republican Ron Johnson he's the incumbent taking on Democrat Mandela Barnes this is another state where we've seen a complete 180 in the polling just as recently as August Mandela Barnes the Democrat candidate was up in virtually every single poll you couldn't find one where the incumbent Ron Johnson the Republican was leading he was up by as many as seven points in some polls for example there was a fox poll in August that had barns up four points that has completely shifted now almost every single poll is showing the race tied or with the Republican Ron Johnson with the lead alright so again a notable shift what's driving it particularly in Wisconsin it's been an interesting thing to have happened to Wisconsin where the race started out by being focused on Ron Johnson himself and not actually on Barnes the race has now shifted where Republicans have poured a lot of money a lot of effort into making people look at Barnes as the main issue for the campaign and that's really given the Democrats some problems Barnes was very uh open about the fact that he was incredibly Progressive he was kind of touted Nationwide as as the great hope for the Democrat Progressive future right Rising Star exactly it was he was dubbed a rising star by many in the National media but he's incredibly Progressive in a state like Wisconsin where 44 percent of Voters say that his views were too extreme for them they have a huge independent base there in Wisconsin that presents problems Republicans have pointed to pictures of him over the last few years wearing a shirt that said abolish ice they pointed to tweets where he said the 2016 election was rigged they pointed to comments he made about Donald Trump being a Russian spy and AOC being his true president all of those things in a state like Wisconsin again with a large independent base there's starting to to really take a hit on him and Republicans are now really pushing this soft on crime message from Barnes and it's having a huge impact as you can see in the polling all right so another Senate race is getting a lot of attention and getting very close is the Georgia Senate race between Republican Herschel Walker and Democrat Rafael Warnock who's the incumbent well this is another example where Republicans are viewing this as a pickup opportunity with Warnock being the incumbent it's different from Pennsylvania and some other states in the sense that Herschel Walker the Republican came out of the primary with overwhelming support he won the Primary really with no real competition but things have really started to shift Warnock gained momentum over the summer when all Democrats did after the the row ruling but since then things have been completely back and forth the the polling averages for the two candidates have just been crisscrossing as each candidate takes the lead and like all the other races both of these candidates have some things that are working against them currently right they do now one area where this race is different is in some of the other races a lot of the the elements working against them are policies driven it's it's things that they did as politicians in the past either of these guys was a politician in their past life and so the issues have been more personally driven Rafael Warnock for example his ex-wife came out said that in 2020 during a domestic dispute he ran over her foot with his car there were some other elements of his personal life that have started to come up as an issue Herschel Walker has the same thing there's been a number of claims brought forward by people domestic claims people claiming that uh you know that he threatened them one person claiming that he had paid for an abortion for her so those are all things that are very serious stories in Georgia that are getting a lot of attention now it's worth noting to this point in the polls it doesn't seem like either of those stories have affected how each party's base is supporting them even with Walker we haven't seen the GOP base shift away from him to this point that'll be the interesting thing to keep an eye on one other thing to keep an eye on in Georgia you have to get at least 50 percent there are a number of third-party candidates that could pull a few points here or there and if that prevents a candidate from getting to 50 then these two the top two will go to a runoff which both campaigns are obviously hoping to avoid okay in the fifth race we're going to look at today is Ohio where we've got Republican JD Vance facing off against Democrat Tim Ryan what's happening with that race well this is a race that a lot of people weren't expecting to really be talking about at this point Republicans they performed very well in 2020 Trump won by almost eight points they won their handily in 2016 as well this is one of the few examples where you see Democrats really over performing expectations if you look at the polling over the last few months there is no front runner here Tim Ryan and JD Vance they are locked head to head again another race we've seen Chris Crossing at the polls a new person seemingly up each week and that is kind of one element where you can see Republicans maybe getting a little nervous Mitch McConnell's Super PAC announced that they'd be pouring 28 million dollars over the next month in ad buys on behalf of Vance their sign of concern there so it's interesting that McConnell's putting money in while the biggest backer for JD Advance is actually taking money out right yeah so Peter Thiel the Republican billion Tech billionaire and mega donor for a lot of campaigns in the past he's actually withdrawn his money from Ohio now you might think that's a bad sign but he's saying internally and at a fundraiser recently he said hey I'm so confident that JD Vance is going to win in Ohio he's on a clear path to Victory I'm going to save my money for other races so he's now transitioned his money to Arizona a race where the Republican there Blake Masters is trailing Mark Kelly the Democrat so you kind of got a juxtaposition there between house or Senate leadership and McConnell saying let's get as much money in there let's make sure we're safe and then you got private money with uh Peter Thiel saying let's let's go elsewhere I'm confident here we'll be talking a lot about those races in the coming weeks so we've just talked a lot about polling but many Americans rightfully so are highly skeptical of polls in general particularly after the last three elections we saw many pollsters get results dramatically wrong almost all of those miscalculations favored Democrats in other words pollsters over counted Democrats and undercounted Republicans at times being 10 points or even more off compared to election results we've just used and will continue to use polling on the show but we're going to do so with great caution we're also going to look to somebody to help us really dig deeper and break some exclusive polling on this show and that person is Robert kahaly the founder of Trafalgar group and he's joining us now it's an honor to be here we want to address this issue head on American skepticism about polling the question here is why should Americans trust or not trust polls what's the difference between a poll that gets it right and one that gets it wrong first of all I would I would tell everybody don't make your decision about whether you're going to vote doesn't want any poll says if you read up your mind you're going to vote for candidate you get out there and vote with the candidate don't let a poll ever commit you to or not to vote uh second yeah you shouldn't trust the polls polls have two purposes they're either to reflect the electorate or they're to affect the electorate and too many of these media and university-based polls are designed to affect the electorate and are trying to create a false narrative quite often when there's when there's not one so what's an example of a race that other pollsters have gotten wrong over the last few months but uview is now starting to correct if you will as the election approaches well I think that you've got a few good examples of that you know early on they were saying that Pennsylvania was in double digits it was never in double digits Georgia was the same situation they were talking like uh Ohio was something that could be lost uh that uh Ron Johnson would just toast and that um that there was no chance uh in Arizona to be to meet Kelly and none of these things turned out to be real and they weren't real then they were creating a false narrative and now as they face the possibility of being very wrong again they're adjusting you know there's been a lot of articles about how the polls there's a word they're going to get it wrong again and so now they're having to get back to reality because they don't mind all being wrong but they hate it when somebody's right and that's what happened to them in Virginia that's what happened to them in 2020 and they don't want to happen again now when we talked about the partnership that we've got for the show with you you mentioned a term that really sort of perked my ears up submerged voters can you explain that for us uh in 2016 they were they were shot it was shy front voters they were for Trump but they you know they've been called deplorables and smelly Walmart voters so they were hesitant especially on live calls to admit their vote for Trump it's called the social desirability bias by 2020 with Council culture was in and there was a pervading media environment about what you should and shouldn't say what should and shouldn't believe they were hesitant to give their opinion so you had to work very hard to get Republicans who were Trump supporting to participate the polls which led a lot of polls over represent the very small minority of Republicans who didn't consider themselves as Trump supporter of America Republicans 2022 is totally different Biden has with his Declaration of Magna supporters kind of being the enemies of the state with Revelations about Facebook and the FBI working together with the talk that the government's pressuring Banks to keep track of credit card transaction for guns it is monological it's not even a least bit of logical jump for a boat to suspect that maybe the government will keep track of what people enter in polls to kind of build a list of those mag Republicans there's such a threat to the country and so they don't want to compete polls at all so we call them submerged now Trafalgar has been better than anyone else at finding some of these voters you've said though you don't feel like you're going to be able to find all of them because they are that deeply submerged what are some of the the steps you take the sort of additional steps to make sure you're hearing from a representative electorate well first of all we believe in short surveys the number one problem I'll post wrong with the surveys are too long they wonder why that they have too many college-educated people because they ask lots of questions and real people the real lives don't always have time to answer all those questions so that's one of the fundamental problems they asked long surveys they cut out regular people's participation they also limit the ways that you can participate you know it's all calls it's all online panels how weird do you have to be to be on an online panel that's not I mean that's insane uh or or they do things that it it's like they just do in text and so we give people a lot of ways to participate because everyone's different and and we also do a larger sample size we're not going to say 400 people represent the whole state 700. it's always a thousand we keep our margin of error under three percent and you know we we dig in a little deeper we give people a lot more Comfort when talking to us and try to get to what's real but even this year I think we're going to underestimate Republican support work because these submerged voters aren't answering polls stickers on the card no signs in the yard they're not even posting on social media they are underwater they're not saying a word to anybody until election day all right Robert great talking with you and as always great stuff as we noted earlier we're going to be talking with Robert again next episode where we'll be breaking down the latest polling from Trafalgar and some exclusive results it's going to be fun to keep track of it all the way down to the end it will that wraps up our first episode of election wire we're going to be back next week with a lot more like we're going to be talking to voters on the ground we're going to be talking to candidates themselves we've got a whole lot more coming we're going to keep track of all those polls and I'm excited for it all right thank you this is John Bickley daily wire editor-in-chief with Cabot Phillips we'll be back next week with election wire foreign [Music]",
    "LpgFtmEtiA8": "with only two days remaining before the final votes are cast which Battleground states are still up for grabs with millions of early ballots already in which party has the upper hand and today we hit the campaign trail with the woman looking to unseat Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and we talk with our a-rated pollster and unveil our latest Battleground poll [Music] hello and welcome to election wire I'm John Bickley daily wire editor-in-chief and I'm joined by senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot we're just two days away from finding out who's going to control the balance of power in Washington we've got some exclusive polling coming we're going to look at some of the early voting but first what have we learned this last week well at the risk of sounding like a broken record we've learned that Republicans still have the momentum it was a very good week for Republicans not only are they continuing to pull closer or even pull ahead even more in Battleground states in the polls but for the first time since July the political modeling site 538 has Republicans with more than a 50 shot at taking the Senate remember over the summer they were at 29 so you've got some of the analytics sites now starting to say so a creep up all week 15 to 51. it crept up all week and now Republicans with 53 chance we've also seen political sites like the cook political report which in the past has actually exaggerated Democrat support in election after election they now shifted the state of 10 races in the house all 10 of them they shifted from Democrats closer to Republicans it's a red wave red tsunami shift right there that's the kind of shift that you're seeing there and you know I love bringing up the betting markets uh very fun to look at those oftentimes they can be even better indicator and the end than polls and right now the Republicans are now after being two to one underdogs in the Senate earlier this summer they're now at a 66 percent chance to win the Senate on the markets and 88 to take over the house so momentum in a lot of different anecdotal areas as well as some of the more analytical areas as well yeah well Republicans I'm sure are hoping the money doesn't lie in that case one reason for that increased optimism is the shift among Suburban Women Voters and that's been interesting can you tell us about that yeah this was fascinating to look at we all know that in 2020 one of the main keys to Democrat success was their performance with Suburban women they make about 20 20 of the electorate they showed out in droves for Democratic candidates a lot of that was the poor performance of President Trump with those female voters but we've seen a major shift taking place this summer a new poll from The Wall Street Journal shows a 27 point swing among Suburban women since August alone back in August this same Wall Street Journal poll had Democrats up 12 with that part of the voting block right now Democrats are down 15 points with Suburban women 27 points might be the most significant shift we've ever seen in that short period of time especially for a demographic this important again 20 of the elector is what they make up and it's just more evidence that abortion is starting to fade from voters Minds this was one of the main motivating factors for Suburban women over the summer as the economies continue to struggle we now see Democrats starting to struggle right we also see a shift this week as President Biden was more on the campaign Trail a little bit more visible this week we also saw Obama out there as well tell us what he was doing and where he was campaigning well the White House had been promising all week that he was going to be making more appearances on the trail we talked last week about how he kind of had been invisible hadn't been making many appearances in these swing States so it's not surprising that he went on the trail what surprising is where he went he didn't go to Pennsylvania or Georgia or Nevada he went to Florida where Republicans are really pulling ahead of those races Marco Rubio is up big in the Senate uh Ron DeSantis the incoming Governor is up big as well and so for him to go to a state like that where it kind of seems Out Of Reach what's surprising to a lot of Voters also his message was interesting he started off by focusing on Social Security and Medicare which makes sense in a state like Florida with an older electorate but then his message on the economy was Far Rosier than you might expect have a listen the economy is in fact growing in fact the economy grew 2.6 percent last quarter and although it may not feel that way people's incomes went up the last quarter more than inflation economic growth is up price inflation is down real incomes are up and gas prices are down so that gives you an idea of the closing message from President Biden and Democrats and it's worth pointing out in that clip most of those comments are simply not true he was fact checked by a number of outlets that were saying yes technically gas is down but it's still up more than a dollar Thirty since he took office the claim that incomes are up over the pace of inflation is just flat out false that is not accurate um and it's kind of a risky strategy that we're seeing from Democrats to instead of saying you know the economy is not doing well we we empathize with you we're gonna we're gonna work on it the message is well actually regardless of what you're feeling the economy is not that bad so that had people talking that that was the closing message that he chose all right so let's get to some of these early voting totals this has been something we've really watched this year as early voting is really ticking up in a lot of States what have we learned and what can we learn from early voting well we'll start with the fact that voter turnout is up for early voting compared to 2018. now there seem to be two main reasons for that one is just that enthusiasm is higher than we've seen in past elections voters in the Democrat and Republican party they say they've been following races more closely they're more excited to get out for this midterm than they were in 2018 but you can't only attribute this uptick and turnout to um you know that enthusiasm it also has to do with covid during covet a number of states passed laws that made early voting permanent and so now a lot of Voters just who voted early for the first time in 2020 because the pandemic are now saying well I'll keep doing this now a number of states do tell us which voters are coming from which parties so we can start to see who has the advantage there this is interesting of the Battleground states where we see party affiliation listed among those early voters four of them Arizona Nevada North Carolina and Florida have Republicans with a higher Advantage at this point of early voting than they had back in 2018 midterms and so those four states Republicans are are well outpacing where they were earlier Florida number one they're they're five to eight percent higher than they were earlier but in those other states Arizona Nevada North Carolina two to five percent they're doing better than they were in the last midterm election so Republicans are excited about that now keep in mind Democrats always perform better in early voting so in every single state Democrats are in the lead right now with early voting but Republicans aren't too concerned about that because we have so much president for it they're actually a little excited that Republicans are pulling ahead where they were in the past the one state where we're seeing the opposite Trend where Democrats have a higher share of early votes than they did in the past is Pennsylvania they're outpacing where they were in 2020 by about two percent Democrats right now 72 percent of the early vote uh have been registered Democrats so that is not good if you're Republicans and it's also one more Point um that the odds campaign was making about why it was so important to have that debate earlier keep in mind early voting was going on All State in or all month in the state of Pennsylvania that debate happened after hundreds of thousands of votes had already been cast and the Alice campaign is not happy about that they feel like those votes may have gone differently if the debate had happened earlier but still a lot of undecided in Pennsylvania yeah what about young voters across the country I definitely wanted to get to this this is a really interesting note that is very concerning for Democrats right now so in 2020 after all the early votes have been cast 16.5 percent of those early voters were voters under the age of 30. that's big for Democrats they do very well with younger voters right now in 2022 just 5.4 percent of early votes cast have been people under the age of 30. so almost three times fewer young people voting early than in 2020. now there could be some some social reasons for that obviously Kobe was a big factor in 2020 but if Democrats are going to hold on to the Senate they have to have strong turnout from young people we're not seeing as much enthusiasm for young people as we saw in 2020 and we're definitely not seeing as much early voting from young people that is good news for Republican candidates who typically perform better with slightly older voters all right so some very fascinating Trends going on with early voting we'll see how this all impacts the races in a couple of days now we're going to bring on a familiar voice for morning wire listeners Georgia Howe who recently joined Republican tutor Dixon on the campaign Trail in Michigan Dixon is facing off against incumbent governor democrat Gretchen Whitmer hey Georgia hey good to have you on good to be on so you spent some time with Tudor Dixon on the campaign Trail in Michigan how to go you know so we spent a few hours with her on her bus we went to a few of her rallies this was on Sunday and I will say having spent that time with her I understand why she's become such a formidable opponent for Gretchen Whitmer she has an impressive background she is a mother of four she spent most of her career in steel manufacturing then she went into Political commentary and she's now really addressing the issues that Michigan voters care about the most so that's probably the biggest Edge she has that's something we've actually seen across the board is this idea that Republicans seem to be focusing on the priorities of Voters more than Democrats what were some of the issues that came up so the three issues that she's focusing on in her campaign are crime education and the economy specifically she talks a lot about jobs now Whitmer is focusing like a lot of Democrats on the issue of abortion how did Tudor Dixon address that issue right so I did ask her about that and I sense that she's being careful about her messaging around abortion because there is a proposition on the ballot this year in Michigan to make abortion a constitutional right here's what she told me there's a ballot measure on the ballot this year in Michigan to add abortion as a constitutional right I understand you are fiercely pro-life how would you balance that if the people of Michigan decided they want that constitutional right well I've made it very clear unlike Gretchen Whitmer there are no laws that I've I will decide not to follow if that is what the people want if that's what they vote in then I will absolutely uphold that law okay so Dixon they're answering like a lot of Republicans we've seen actually saying that she will not violate or go against the will of the people if they choose to back up certain abortion measures yeah that's that's the gist of what she was saying and what about the issue of Education that's something that Dixon's focused on a lot right so she's making this a Cornerstone of her campaign one of the major topics is masks in schools school lockdowns so she knows a lot of parents are angry about that and she has relentlessly tied Whitmer to those school closures because she knows that's a huge liability that came up in the debate yes so from your time with her do you feel like she's confident that she's going to win you know I did sense that she's pretty confident you don't get the same Kerry lake level of confidence but I mean I think she has some energy behind her for a reason and I she brings it to her events every single time I can tell so she sent it to win it yeah it's going to be a fascinating one it'll be an upset if she wins for sure thanks Georgia next we have our under the radar segment where we look at a race or two that is not getting enough national attention Kevin what race do you think we should keep an eye on Tuesday I'm watching the mayor's race in Los Angeles where billionaire businessman Rick Caruso is giving Democrat congresswoman Karen bass a serious run for her money now carusoe is technically running as a Democrat but keep in mind he's been a republican throughout his life he just recently changed party affiliation and if you listen to his campaign he sounds a lot like a republican still especially on the issue of crime he's really gone Law and Order whereas bass has run on a more lenient more Progressive kind of far left strategy when it comes to Crime so far he's outspent her with 80 million of of his own dollars 80 million dollars it's a lot of money for a mayor's race it's the most expensive race in the history of the city big city bass has spent around 11 million dollars so the two were just blanketing the airwaves right now especially Caruso so if he wins this would be a serious repudiation of the Progressive Movement in Los Angeles and we could have a very moderate you know some people still consider him a Republican mayor of Los Angeles yeah it's a big about face yeah and it falls in line with Trends we've seen in some of the other major cities that have Progressive DA's Prime crime crime good choice now every week we also look at what we call pivot Points or moments we think could really shape or even redirect a race for mine this week I'm looking at a moment with Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Federman whose debate performance against Dr Oz appears to have really heard him in the polls so Federman had a chance to redeem his debate performance in an interview with CNN's Don Lemon on Tuesday yet again this did not go well for him there's a viral moment went viral for all the wrong reasons for the fetterman campaign let's watch this well let's talk about inflation because that's a big concern for voters what do you think the biggest cause of inflation is and should the Biden Administration be doing more I I just do I I think that that simply is also we have this talk about the trillions in massive tax uh tax cuts to the corporate tax structure as well true you know trillions of dollars that have added to the deficit and and now they still want to support those as well true I think in terms of being very serious about addressing inflation is is making sure that those rates are brought back into a line with what they they should have been uh where they're able to uh fight uh the the the deficit so once again fetterman's struggling to answer and they're on a pretty friendly platform for him that could prove to be another pivotal moment for fetterman Kevin what are you looking at I'm looking at a man named Mark Victor in Arizona you're probably not familiar with Mark Victor he was the libertarian party nominee in the senate race there this week he dropped out and endorsed the Republican Blake Masters it is a big deal because he was polling around one to six percentage points throughout the state which that's enough to shift a race as close as this one between Masters and Kelly now traditionally third party candidates pull relatively evenly from Democrats and Republicans but when you've got a Libertarian candidate who again is more likely to align with Republicans come out and say hey Masters is a good guy he'd be a good Senator all of his supporters telling them go vote for Blake Masters that is a serious moment that could shift this race so a lot of Republicans are very grateful for Mark Victor yeah and our polling showed just a one point you know gap between the two you all right it's time now for one final look at the polls before Tuesday's action Kevin what's the latest from the Battleground races we've been tracking well I want to start in New York with the governor's race that has quickly become one of the most discussed races in the entire country after not even being a race for much of the summer Republican Lee zeldin now leads in the latest Trafalgar polling 48.4 to 47.6 within the margin of error this one is going to be very very close keep watching the New York Governor's race you heard that right New York could have a republican Governor come Tuesday then we go off to Michigan another governor's race that no one expected to be this close that is increasingly tight again within the margin of error the latest American greatness Insider Advantage poll all tied up at 45 there are still five percent of Voters saying they're undecided keep an eye on how they break but one reason that tutor Dixon the Republican is even in this race is because of her performance with Independence the latest polling shows Independence breaking by 20 points for Republicans if we see a similar break going on with undecideds it's going to be even closer than a lot of people predicted and could end up going for republicans in Michigan heading now to the Senate we'll go down to Georgia where Herschel Walker has pulled ahead in another poll we've seen a growing number of polls where he's in the lead after a lot of people really wrote him off after some of those stories about his personal life over the summer the latest polling has him up by one point but keep in mind for this race we very well could be looking at a runoff if you don't get to 50 the top two candidates had to run off both campaigns hoping to avoid that and uh so keep keep an eye on that 50 number as election night approaches but things are looking very good right now for Herschel Walker then out to Nevada the senate race where Democrats had started to get some good news after a fall where things were really not looking good for them Catherine Cortez mastered the Democrat incumbent is ahead in the latest USA Today poll by one point there was another New York Times poll that had her with an even larger lead than that but since then we've seen a number of polls now where Adam laxalt the Republican is up five points and two of them up three in another so things are kind of all over the place but keep in mind the momentum clearly has been for Adam laxalt and the Republicans so those two polls where uh Cortez masto was leading seemed to be outliers at this point but the Nevada race again too close to call keep an eye there on Election night Pennsylvania we go there next where the senate race between Dr Oz and John fetterman Salman if you've heard this is a toss-up the latest polling from Morning Call has both of them tied at 47. some people thought that the clear Advantage was going to Dr Oz after that really tough debate performance for fetterman we haven't seen a huge break for Oz but it is clear that he does still have the momentum this race is still tight those betting markets that we talked about earlier do have odds with a two to one advantage so a stronger Advantage there than we've seen in the polls but again Oz with the momentum right now though it is within the margin of error and we'll end with the senate race in Washington State that's right there is a tight Senate race going on in Washington state where most people expected complete Democrat dominance because right now Tiffany Smiley the Republican is within 1.48 49 she's trailing Democrat incumbent Patty Murray the main issue there as has been in the Oregon Governor's race which is also incredibly tight is crime and it's homelessness those two issues Smiley has really capitalized on in states that have been ravaged by those two things and the race is closer than anyone predicted it's a toss-up right now so keep an eye on Washington State it could be going red this year for the first time in a very long time joining us now to reveal the results of another daily wire exclusive poll is Robert kahali founder of Trafalgar group hey Robert it's great to be here now we pulled New Hampshire this week where we have Democrat incumbent Maggie Hassan versus Republican Challenger Don Bolduc and we got a maybe a not so surprising result Don boldick is now leading by over 1.47 to Maggie Hassan's 45.7 percent so a 1.3 percent lead how does that align with other polls well it it's you know it's right in line with the other folks what we've seen in the last few uh weeks is uh Emerson had one I believe they had bullied down by two uh then there was Matt Towery with Insider Advantage always does exceptional polling and I think he had Bulldog only down by one and then uh just a couple of days ago uh uh absolute College came out with one that had Bullock up by one and so this is we'll look up by just a little over one so that it's very much in line with kind of what we felt like was going to happen all along with the Republican votes kind of consolidating because months before this race when we upholded we saw both um public and his Republican Challenger Morris were both both winning against Houston so right after the uh primary you have these hurt feelings that follow a primary right and so people have to kind of come together now what is noteworthy is because there's very little early voting in New Hampshire I mean virtually none everything is going to be election day so the polls uh more than almost any other state at the end are more reflective of what the result will be than having to anticipate where the polls were at the time of early but and how many undecideds do we have in the state I think it was 3.20 3.4 and they were decidedly anti-jobiden okay so things looking favorably for Baltic there let's move over to New York you guys had a couple of interesting polls and some fascinating questions you asked New Yorkers this week we're seeing Republican Lee zeldin now pulling even with Kathy hokel in fact your group Trafalgar Group found him with a slight Edge tell us about that about that poll yeah it's very very tight uh statistical tab but as Eldon does have a 0.8 uh percent lead and what we've seen you know months ago we started talking about this race because it looked very much like New Jersey did to us in 2021. so what we have been doing is we've seen it and it is tightened each time and you know some of the mainstream problem that said it was you know two or three you know huge margins you know 10 point 20 points uh they've all kind of come to where we are and realized this was close what we've also noticed is during the course of doing the poem a lot of people kept saying well you know Cuomo would be doing better on crime or just volunteering for mother's name and it occurred to me there may be something to that that you know the Cuomo you know promo and his father both run and been very successful over the years and there's probably a little bit of a bobo machine still in place in this state and so we asked some additional questions and one was who do you think did a better job hopeful or uh Cuomo and Como won that 60 40. and then we asked if the election uh coming up between Zelda and Cuomo how would you be voting and promo beat zeld in 5545 so what that tells us is there are a lot of folks who say I'm for Cuomo whereas Cuomo versus zeldon and I'm versus zeldom with a zeldom versus opal so part of uh Zelda's winning Coalition at this point are people who for whatever reason which Cuomo was still there well that's kind of counter intuitive there I think a lot of people would be surprised by that development fascinating stuff Robert we'll see you next time in just a couple of days on Election night can't wait for it you'll be in-house with us again this is it for this episode of election wire we'll be back Tuesday with all the election news you need to know [Music]",
    "azUW6peDhBY": "[Music] the counting continues races in several Battleground states have yet to be finalized leaving the Senate up for grabs while the Republicans Edge closer to controlling the

election day final votes are still being counted in crucial Battleground states with the fate of the Senate still in the balance here are the latest results and what it means for the balance of power in Washington as daily wire senior editor Kevin Phillips Cabot as the dust starts to settle here where do things stand well on Tuesday night there was definitely a sense of letdown among Republican voters and it's easy to see why politicians have promised a red wave and polls had indicated that they would cruise to a house majority and pick up at least a few seats in the Senate and when that did not happen there was a lot of pessimism among the Republican base but as more results started to come in Wednesday it became clear that while things were definitely underwhelming initially there's actually still a good chance that Republicans will control the house and the Senate when all is said and done yeah let's get to that what are we seeing in the Senate since we last spoke Republican incumbent Ron Johnson was declared the winner in Wisconsin that brought Republicans to 48 seats throw in Alaska where they're still counting votes but the top two candidates are Republicans and they're at 49 and that means they've got to win two out of the three remaining States between Nevada Arizona and Georgia Nevada looks like their best shot right now votes are still being counted but Republican Challenger Adam laxalt is ahead by around three points so barring a late break for Democrats in Nevada his victory would put Republicans at 50. all right so that leaves us with Arizona and Georgia exactly so Arizona got a lot of attention on Election Day because of those defective voting machines in Maricopa County and because of that and other factors we're still waiting on the results and officials there say it could be even a few more days into Friday or Saturday until we know the final results yeah while Republican gubernatorial nominee Kerry Lake was in a dead heat with Democrat Katie Hobbs the Senate was a different story as Republican Blake Masters was down a few points though he's been closing in throughout the past day or so so now the question becomes if there are enough votes left in Maricopa County to turn things for Republicans but if not the balance of power in the Senate would come down to Georgia now we've been talking a lot about that race all month and it was one of the few states where polling was actually quite accurate where do things stand now in Georgia so Democrat incumbent Rafael Warnock actually came out with more votes than Republican Herschel Walker but because neither candidate hit that 50 Mark we're heading to a runoff on December 6th and it very well could decide the fate of the Senate now if that sounds familiar it's because the exact same thing happened back in 2020 and into 2021 when Democrats won both seats in the runoff to tie things up at 50 50. right we all remember that one we're clearly going to have a lot to cover from Georgia over the next month okay shifting gears to the house what are we looking at there votes are still coming in across a number of key districts but it looks likely that Republicans will regain control of the chamber by a slim margin meaning speaker Nancy Pelosi will be removed and it'll also give Republicans control of powerful oversight committees that control budgets and launch investigations but perhaps most importantly it means that they will be able to thwart much of President Biden's legislative agenda regardless of what happens with the Senate so that was the main cause for celebration among Republicans on a Wednesday though we're still waiting for the final number now obviously there are too many races to cover them all but what were some of the more surprising results yeah there were a few big names from each party who ended up losing for the Democrats the biggest surprise was definitely the defeat of Sean Patrick Maloney he was the chair of the powerful Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee that's the party's main campaign arm so an embarrassing defeat speaker Pelosi acknowledged the result on Wednesday saying that Maloney quote took an arrow for us she elaborated saying that he bore the brunt of Republican attacks as one of the party leaders there's still a lot to get to and as you've just laid out the battle for the Senate is far from over

measures and how voters decided is daily wire's Charlotte Pence Bond so Charlotte first off which states were considering expanding marijuana use hi Georgia so the states that considered a measure like that were Arkansas Maryland Missouri and North and South Dakota 19 other states as well as DC have already passed legislation that allows marijuana to be used for personal reasons and 37 States already let marijuana be used for medical reasons so what happened did those measures pass some did Missouri and Maryland voted in favor of the measures Missouri's amendment allows marijuana use for people 21 years old and up it also puts a sales tax on it and erases certain marijuana related offenses it passed with around 53 percent of the vote Maryland also approved its measure but at a steeper win over 65 percent voted in favor of it it allows marijuana use for people 21 and over as well and allows attacks to be established on its sales but North Dakota South Dakota and Arkansas all voted against measures that would have made the use and possession of marijuana legal for people who are again at least 21 years old Arkansas's measure would have also put a sales tax on marijuana and allowed it to be sold commercially if it had passed it would have been the first state in the Deep South to allow the recreational use of marijuana this is the second time North Dakota rejected an amendment like this they had a similar ballot measure in 2018. South Dakota on the other hand voted in favor of recreational and medical marijuana use in 2020 but the state supreme court threw out the amendment that made recreational use legal last year and then this time around the voters rejected it all right now what about the abortion measures for the most part voters affirmed their support for abortion Michigan Vermont and California all enshrined abortion as a right in their state constitutions and in Kentucky voters rejected a measure that would have denied a constitutional right to abortion Kentucky currently has legislation Banning most abortions but that's being challenged in court so this vote could impact how the court sees abortion in the state pro-life voters might see some success in Montana there they had a born alive measure on the ballot that would make it so that healthcare workers have to try to save a baby's life if he or she is born alive but the votes haven't all been counted yet and were there any other notable social issues on the ballot this year Nebraska voters green lit a measure that will raise the minimum wage in the state to 15 dollars per hour by 2026. and in DC voters approved increasing the minimum wage for tipped workers to be the same as non-tipped workers so it sounds like a mixed bag on social issues Charlotte thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond [Music] the big story on Tuesday night was the red wave that wasn't Republicans had been hoping for a massive Victory but will have to settle for less while there were some bright spots for the GOP Democrats outperformed expectations and though they are poised to lose control of the House of Representatives they may still hold the Senate and they hung on to some key governorships joining us to break it down as columnist David Marcus morning Dave so what went wrong with the Red Wave good morning I I think there's plenty of blame to go around but a lot of that is being directed at Donald Trump who had predicted a big night for republicans and was clearly prepared to take credit for one uh his hand-picked Senate candidates especially oz in Pennsylvania and bolduck in New Hampshire they just didn't perform well but it's not all his fault right he wasn't on the ballot Republicans and a lot of people in the media seem to misread the priorities of the voters who came out and that really told the tale what are big issues that drove these victories for Democrats when we look at the exit polling results well abortion appears to have been a big driver of votes more than I think anyone on the right maybe even on the left for that matter expected and with Roe v Wade overturned this is going to be a big issue for Democrats going forward there was also concern expressed by voters about threats to democracy and you know that's another area where Trump and his allies claims about the 2020 election may have hurt Republicans inflation did come up as a big issue but it's not clear and here Kevin McCarthy might get some blame that voters thought the GOP had the solution Republicans seem to be running more on anybody but Biden while priorities were certainly part of the equation some of this appears to have come down to you know the quality of the individual candidates some of whom clearly just didn't connect enough with voters in their states that certainly appears to be true and and is the case with Dr Oz and in Pennsylvania no it wasn't all bad news for Republicans especially in Florida where Rhonda Santos soared to an easy 20-point victory in what now looks like a pretty solidly red state yes and DeSantis is clearly the big winner here aside from maybe Joe Biden there's a reason the cover of Wednesday's New York Post was a picture of him with the headline the future I I think it's down to him just having done a very good job as Governor a Floridians clearly appreciate his handling of kovit his opening of the state Brian Kemp and Georgia who also opened early one easily as well right voters there just feel good about the state of their states um and there will be conservatives who do look at both of them as a kind of prototype for future win yeah I'm sure they will now for New York your home Republicans had hoped to pull out an absolute shocker in the governor's race but fell short there how close did Lee zeldon get to defeating Kathy hokel and what were the down ballot implications of that race yeah I got this one wrong um that that happens uh I I thought Selden would win and he did get very close he lost by about four points to put that in some perspective Andrew Cuomo won four years ago by 22 points so it's still a very dramatic shift brought about really by zeldon's focus on crime Uncle kind of woke up in the last week or so and probably saved her job by pivoting a bit towards the issue of crime at least admitting to some extent that it's a problem she will address but as you said down ballot the implications were huge it looks like New York could flip as many as four House Seats from Blue to red and that includes uh Sean Patrick Maloney it was the the chair of the D Triple C and Nicole Mali attack is defeated Max Rose in a house race Democrats had hoped to flip at the end of the day it might be that Kevin McCarthy becomes Speaker of the House on Lee zeldon's coattails where do Tuesday's results leave us in terms of the 2024 election given that one cycle just sort of seems to bleed into the next one these days it's a huge question we've seen Trump already start to take some Digs at the santis he said something about having dirt on him so far to status is not willing to get in the mud and is ignoring Trump but look Trump's very likely to run he may announce soon and Republican leadership and Republican voters they're going to have a big choice on their hands yeah they will well as we noted yesterday election night didn't go according to script for the GOP but it didn't go all wrong either if good stuff as

at Disney following a tumbling stock price and a number of public battles over political issues the media Empire announced late Sunday evening that former CEO Bob Iger will be returning to replace him here to tell us what led to japix ouster and what might happen next in the Magic Kingdom is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan chapik is out and Iger is back in that seems like a surprise yeah it is it really seemed to shock a lot of Hollywood and I think the reason is that Disney's board had just awarded chapic a new multi-year contract over the summer so people tended to see that as a vote of confidence but the reality was that Disney's stock price had taken a steady stream of blows it had lost around 36 percent of its value in 2022 and the company's streaming division had losses topping 1.5 billion in the last quarter because of that chapic announced on November 11th that he was going to freeze hiring and layoffs would probably be coming and in fact streamlining operations and trimming fat is really what Bob chapic was hired to do he's kind of known for being a focused Financial operator and Disney had been suffering below to even before the pandemic posed some we have to admit historic challenges there was the shutting down of the theme parks and film and TV Productions well jpeg actually weathered those challenges pretty well by most standards but his wavering on other problems within the company is what seemed to get the better of him now what problems specifically are you referring to well you know we saw of course the internal unrest over Disney's shifting stances regarding social issues for example basically there was Florida's legislation preventing public schools from teaching younger students about gender and sexuality at first chapix said Disney was going to stay quiet about that new legislation and that the company was not going to be political going forward but when employees revolted the pendulum kinda seemed to swing in another extreme leaked tape showed chapic apologizing somewhat abjectly for that position he and other Disney Executives instead promised that Disney would fight Florida's Bill and on top of that it would add more LGBT elements to its children's content well all of that had some concrete Financial consequences when Governor Ron DeSantis responded by stripping Disney of its special tax privileges for the Reedy Creek district and that's where Disney World sits and then of course it was just terrible PR for Disney's key customer base which happens to be parents and kids one Disney staffer told me on background today and I'll just quote him capric was weak I think he had the right impulses early on but the woke activists and the company smelled the weakness and took advantage of it now why are they going back to Iger though I mean he's retired he's 71 why not bring in someone new well you know I think given all that instability the board probably felt that it needed a practiced hand back at that tiller Eiger had been Disney's previous CEO for 15 years during a period of really massive expansion that saw Disney acquire a lot of properties including Marvel Pixar 20th Century Fox lucasfilm which of course means Star Wars and frankly it was Iger who positioned Disney as a more politically Progressive company in the first place a lot of activist employees liked that about him my sources inside Disney tell me there's a lot of celebrating going on right now in the Disney slack Channel That's dedicated to LGBT Pride so the feeling could be that Iger is going to quiet all of that internal dissension but what's clear is Disney is viewing Iger as a temporary solution in the announcement of his return the board said that he's only signing on for two years and a key part of his role in that time is going to be and I'm just going to quote developing a successor to lead the company still one issue that they're going to face is that Disney remains a massively bloated company that needs to streamline and Bob Iger was actually the executive who created a lot of that problem so it's very unlikely that he's going to make any kind of serious cuts and that's something that we're going to want to watch especially as this most recent move is likely causing a lot of angst amongst investors making this switch less than a year after the board unanimously extended chapix contract definitely gives off something of a sense of floundering within the operation right well it'll be interesting to see what Iger does Megan thanks so much for reporting yeah anytime that was

political change Iran has been in a state of upheaval for weeks due to protests but now the government is ramping up its efforts to quash dissent daily wire investigative reporter mired alordi is here with the details for us so marade what's the latest on these protests hi Georgia well the latest is pretty disturbing the Iranian government is cracking down extremely hard on these protesters many of whom are young teenagers protesters are often beaten and detained in jail some have been beaten after they were taken into custody others have been shot and killed in the streets now Iran has had political unrest in the past what sparked this round of protests administrations began after the September death of a 22 year old Kurdish Iranian woman named Masa amini amini was arrested and detained by Iran's religious morality police for not wearing a hijab properly women who were arrested with her say she was severely beaten by police and she died days later in a Tehran Hospital in the weeks since amini's death some female protesters have publicly cut their hair or refused to wear the hijab during the demonstrations in fact the protests have been largely led by women essentially they're demanding freedom from Iran's clerical rule now how large are these protests these protests are reportedly more widespread than the political protests Iran saw in 2009 2017 and 2019. Iran has already arrested more than 14 000 people and charged at least one thousand with crimes in the Tehran Province protesters have marched in the streets around the country daily since September 16th they've scuffled with law enforcement and allegedly set fire to government buildings over the weekend authorities sentenced the first person to death over the protests convicting the person of enmity against God and spreading corruption on Earth according to State media according to the group Iran human rights Iran's security forces have killed at least 326 protesters since the demonstrations began two months ago Also earlier this month a majority of Iran's Parliament wrote a letter to the Judiciary calling for protesters to be taught a good lesson and face harsh punishments which could include the death penalty now you mentioned that many of the protesters are young are the Iranian police dealing with them differently because of that or are they cracking down just as hard no the police seem to be treating the teen protesters just as harshly as the adults the average age of the protesters is about 15 and Iran's youth have been particularly harmed in this Crackdown according to lawyers and human rights activists authorities have even raided schools and beaten students to death including a 15 year old girl one extremely disturbing development being reported by CNN and the BBC is that many women and girls involved in the women's rights protests appear to have been violently raped in police custody police apparently commit sexual violence on protesters as young as 13 or 14 as a way to discourage the demonstrations so a very violent approach from the Iranian police morade thanks for reporting thanks Georgia that was daily wire investigative reporter maraid alordi foreign as the fentanyl crisis makes National headlines an additional layer to the tragedy is now clear the combination of fentanyl with other drugs such as methamphetamine is creating a new overdose crisis here with more information as daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond so Charlotte the crisis worsens what's the latest on this well the latest is even more Grim the CDC says more than 150 people die every day from overdoses related to synthetic opioids including Fentanyl and now there is an increasing amount of overdoses that are being caused by a combination of multiple drugs last year 20 of the total fatal overdoses included an opioid like Fentanyl and a psychostimulant like meth that's according to preliminary federal information but 10 years before that those combos only made up around 2 percent of fatal overdoses but of course using any of these drugs on their own poses serious health risks and even death meth can lead to deadly heart damage hallucinations and erratic actions last year around two-thirds of people who died while using psychostimulants also had opioids in their system but that isn't always intentional sometimes the drug they buy is laced or there's cross-contamination where it's made and are we seeing an increase in overdose deaths across the board Yes Federal data shows that last year around 33 400 deaths involved psychostimulants which was an increase of more than 340 percent from five years before in the same amount of time fatalities involving synthetic opioids increased 270 percent and total drug fatalities also went up 71 as psychostimulant deaths have gone up so have deaths that also involved opioids and last year around 75 percent of meth-related fatalities in the state of North Carolina also involved fentanyl methyl fentanyl use have both surged across the country and are spreading into new regions for example drug traffickers are pushing meth into the Northeast and Fentanyl availability is increasing in western states where a meth once dominated now we've seen that fentanyl is spreading Beyond border states but what are the numbers now On the Border in terms of trafficking we're just seeing more and more fentanyl smuggled across the border for example a Mexican man was recently sentenced to prison for his involvement with an attempted smuggling of meth and Fentanyl the seizure was the country's biggest for each drug for the calendar years 2021 and 2022 as of last month the trafficking attempt included over 17 000 pounds of meth and about 389 pounds of fentanyl this month border officers found 26 pounds of meth and 10 pounds of fentanyl in El Paso in the same smuggling effort Port director Ray provencio said that it's not normal to find huge quantities of two different heart drugs but dual smuggling is becoming more common as of October border patrol had seized over a thousand pounds of fentanyl since the start of this fiscal year that's a 200 percent increase from the last year and while fentanyl seizures are more of a recent Trend the inflow of meth has been a problem for much longer well let's hope we see some progress on this crisis soon Charlotte thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond other stories we're tracking this week the US Coast Guard and the U.S border Patrol say that over 100 migrants were saved from a boat

Workforce the company's woes mirror those being felt throughout the tech sector here to tell us why Facebook's parent company meta is having to make such deep cuts and what it tells us about the state of big Tech is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan first off how many employees is meta laying off quite a few it is laying off 13 percent of its Workforce across all of medis companies so that includes Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp so essentially what we're talking about here is around 11 000 jobs and that is the biggest Tech layoff so far this year now that's an especially High number when you remember that since its founding 18 years ago Facebook has never had to cut back its Workforce so this was meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressing the layoffs in a leaked video Wednesday afternoon I take full responsibility for this decision and it was it was you know one of the hardest calls that I've had to make in in the 18 years of running the company this comes after meta announced a second straight quarter of declining Revenue in October and the company has also signaled investors to expect further bad news in the fourth quarter so just not going well now you said that meta's cuts represent the biggest Tech layoff which other companies are experiencing the same yeah a bunch of them everywhere you look Tech is struggling so last week Amazon announced that it has put a freeze on hiring for at least a few months because it said the economy and I'm quoting is in an uncertain place after that the company says it will continue monitoring the economic situation and then the ride share company Lyft is laying off 13 of its Workforce they say they're preparing for a likely recession next year and then just keep adding to it the payment processing platform stripe is cutting 14 of its staff the company's CEO said in a memo to employees I'm going to quote we were much too optimistic about the internet economy's near-term growth in 2022 and 2023 and underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown that's to say nothing of course of Elon Musk firing about 50 percent of Twitter employees and you know that's something we've talked about here before so Microsoft and Google aren't cutting yet but they are telling investors that new hiring is going to be minimal and much lower than in past quarters what that means is that overall we're only a couple of weeks into November yet we've already seen more layoffs in the industry than in any other month this year according to one report over 21 000 employees have lost jobs across 46 different companies in less than two weeks so really just a lot of pain all throughout tech and as John said it mirrors the economic realities elsewhere now is this all due to the economy or are there some tech specific issues that are causing this a lot of it is due to the pandemic and inflationary spending and that's affecting everyone and following the midterm elections President Biden announced that he has no plans to do anything differently regarding Economic Policy so the industry really does have very little reason to expect that anything's going to change in the near future but yeah there are some issues unique to Tech first many companies like Amazon and meta had gone on what you might call hiring sprees the last two years to keep up with demand from people who are stuck at home during covid and then something that hits social media companies really hard was the Privacy update on Apple's iPhones what that did was limit targeted advertising so digital ads have been cut back because of that and that's compounded by the fact that digital advertising had already been cutting back anyway as consumers have reigned in spending as a reaction to all that inflation so what we're seeing is something of a domino effect and as of right now there's really not much reason to be optimistic that we're going to see any changes in the near future Megan thanks for reporting yep anytime that's daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham coming up new data is released on America's stubborn inflation are you tired of being the gatekeeper of all of your family's plans well the Skylight calendar

November 2021 through this October that's a decrease of a half point from September here to discuss the latest inflation numbers is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim the latest inflation report is here and it looks like pressure on prices has eased slightly what can we expect from inflation in the future based on this report nobody can say anything for sure the CPI report for October is trending the right way and some economists say this is a hopeful sign that inflation is peaked the economists like to look at what's called The Core inflation rate it sets aside gas and groceries and measures price increases for everything else it's not a very accurate measure of how inflation impacts people day to day because food and fuel are usually weekly Staples but economists use the core rate because they think it's a better predictor of long-term trends now the core inflation rate slowed a bit in October over the course of 12 months core inflation Rose 6.3 percent in October a slight decrease of 0.3 points from the month before the important thing for economists though is that the rate of inflation curved down now when can Americans actually expect to see prices stabilize unfortunately there isn't a good answer here inflation is still hot so people can expect prices to continue to jump higher in the coming weeks and months the increments between those price jumps may be slowing down though it's also very possible that inflation stays high for a while longer there are certainly plenty of factors that could keep pushing prices higher especially in the next few months as winter sets in and the demand for energy spikes now what is President Biden saying about this obviously before the midterms they were under pressure to give good news to make big promises has the tone changed the White House is celebrating this CPI report Biden said he expects Americans to see Headway on inflation in the next few months it's going to take time to get inflation back to normal levels we could see setbacks along the way I realize that but we are laser focused on it that's why it's so critical for us to pass the important legislation this year to lower those costs for families and I know it's going to take time to implement our entire economic agenda which we already passed and for folks to field it in their day-to-day lives but I think folks are going to see it in the next few months and what about Wall Street did they react at all stock surge on the news it was the biggest one-day rally since 2020. the s p Rose about five percent and the Dow climbed 1200 points as Traders hope this means the FED will ease up on monetary tightening the FED appears likely to stay the course for now though Dallas fed president Lori Logan called the CPI data a welcome relief but said there's still a long way to go to curb inflation all right well Tim thanks so much for reporting thanks for having me that's daily wire reporter Tim Pierce [Music] in this year's midterm cycle some Democrats employed a risky and controversial tactic in which they elevated and even contributed to the primary campaigns of Republican candidates closely aligned with Donald Trump the results are in and it appears to have worked in all eight races where this Gambit was played the Democrat won the general election this included a high-profile New Hampshire Senate race four Governors races and a few Congressional contests here to discuss this role of the Electoral Dice and why it worked as communist David Marcus hey Dave so is this correct they batted a thousand on this very risky Gamble good morning and yes I mean the final score is what it is and it really was a gamble uh last week there was gnashing of teeth and wailing of whales from the left over the possibility that some of these more maga-style Republicans would win on the Democrats dime but not only did all eight candidates lose uh they generally sometimes dramatically underperformed compared to and what should we call them more traditional Republicans in their states right Chris sununu won the New Hampshire's governor's race with 57 percent of the vote but bolduced the trump-backed Senate candidate he only got 44 and that was pretty much happening across the board now Democrats were criticized for meddling in GOP primaries even by other Democrats who feared that by helping what they view as more radical candidates they really undermine their message and how dangerous supposedly these candidates are are Democrats going to pay a price for that I don't think so I I mean this is kind of inside baseball and frankly in this political environment both sides are willing to look the other way a little bit at questionable tactics as long as they work um did they lose a bit of the moral High Ground maybe but I doubt it you know as Finley Peter Dunn once wrote politics ain't being bad right now the through line here is that all of these targeted candidates were not just endorsed by Trump but very closely tied to him are there losses raising alarm bells in the GOP yes that's already happening but let's also note that JD Vance won and and lake and Masters are doing well in Arizona particularly lake so I mean Trump has had some wins and could get another with Herschel Walker former speaker Paul Ryan expressed concern about Trump's impact I imagine Mitt Romney is also worried but there haven't been major defections from Trump and also Democrats meddled a bit in these primary races but the mega candidates won them fairly so I mean For Better or Worse the Trump endorsement still has a lot of purchase among GOP voters it's not just within the Republican party but also in conservative media that we see a lot of blame directed at president Trump the New York Post cover has mocked him for two days in the Wall Street Journal had a blistering op-ed blaming him does that move the needle as a columnist I should probably answer that question with a yes um but this is Donald Trump uh every time the quote unquote establishment thinks he's wounded and ready to be taken out it just Fizzles all the scandals back in 2016 came to nothing again after January 6th we saw this bubbling of talk about whether it would break the Trump fever it didn't um so all this talk of you know is it finally time for the GOP to break with Trump what does that even mean like practically does every Republican journalist and politician simultaneously tweet I disavowed Donald Trump the only people who can execute that break are the voters because Trump's relationship to them is direct right now where does all this leave the Republican leaders in Congress Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy Trump allies have pointed blame at them for the lackluster performance and accuse them of scapegoating trump I think that criticism is easier to make of McConnell after all he openly questioned the quality of some of these candidates during the campaign he didn't have to do that Kevin McCarthy's walked a very careful line with Trump and Trump World there are some calls to block his uh speakership most notably from representative Matt Gates this may be posturing to get concessions from McCarthy on the direction that the house will take but hey I mean he knows he's not speaker yet and he also likely is aware that the one person who can make that all but a certainty is named Donald Trump yeah that might be right thank you for joining us David thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus [Music] that's all the time we've got this morning thanks for

smile that comes from years of Orthodontics by any conventional standard he's handsome he has a dog but no girlfriend and if he had his way he'd be dead right now [Music] when people think of assisted suicide they typically imagine someone elderly perhaps weeks or months away from natural death or they might think of patients diagnosed with terminal cancer or Alzheimer's that's in large part because these are the pictures that advocates for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide have been painting for years their argument is that death in these cases is inevitable allowing doctors to kill as well as heal eases suffering Advocates say they contend that allowing these patients to decide how and when they die provides a sense of dignity and autonomy but what do you do with a young man who wants to end his life because he's depressed that the diabetes diagnosis he received at age four has recently caused him to go blind in one eye and is impairing his vision in the other if

bathroom because I don't know this place I'm not gonna have to do any of that I'm gonna go to sleep so happy not even hesitating to close my eyes and that's what I was looking forward to piano's story Drew International notice after his mother discovered only two weeks before he was scheduled to die that her son had been approved for physician-assisted suicide the email she found on keanu's laptop laid out in clear clinical detail how his life would end on September 22nd 2022. he would arrive at the assisted suicide facility at 8 30 a.m at 9 the doctor would administer Two drugs that would put him into a coma and stop his breathing the process would take no more than 10 minutes he could bring his dog if he wanted when the doctor who'd agreed to help her son kill himself refused to speak with her keanu's mom started an online campaign she was racing the clock to stop the procedure from taking place and her efforts quickly caught the attention of local media outlets in a few short days keanu's case was being debated on the Evening News Mike we just talked before break Rupa Miranda had an article on the rise of Canada's assisted suicide program she gives this case study of a 23 year old young man with diabetes and depression and just how easy it was for this young man to get signed up for assisted suicide how do we find ourselves in this place piano takes exception to the idea that it was easy for him to get approved for the medical assistance and dying program known in Canada as made the main law that first passed in 2016 only applied to people facing imminent natural death but in 2021 the law was expanded to include those who have quote Grievous and irremediable medical conditions keanu's diabetes meant he qualified from there two is two it medical professionals had to evaluate his case over the course of 90 days to decide if his wish to kill himself should be granted Keanu says the process was Rife with the kind of inefficiency and disorganization common to government-run programs he constantly had to find paperwork and medical records on his own just to push his request forward I would text the doctors and try to get things going I would notice that there is miscommunication between the two assessors like one assessed the second assessor said I've asked for the psychiatric notes to confirm your your medical capacity I've not received it from the first Assessor so I would message the first assessor and say they're waiting on the notes can you please send them oh I already have I've sent it in an email okay they sent it in your email can you check your email well I checked my email when would have they sent it and if I go on back and forth so there's no secretary or person managing these these two it was me and I called the stunt house frustrated I was so Furious actually when I called them and I called the coordination service and I said what's going on here like who manages this who coordinates this why do I feel like I'm putting in all the effort but Keanu believes that his persistence in the face of so much bureaucratic incompetence only proves how sincere he was in his wish to die and it explains why he was so upset when his mother's social media campaign said succeeded in preventing him from doing so after her petitions gained tens of thousands of signatures and generated public outcry the doctor who'd agreed to carry out the procedure backed out if Keanu still wanted to kill himself he would need to find another physician willing to help him perhaps fearing negative media attention none has yet stepped forward to take up his case he went to a local hospital to suggest he could stop giving himself insulin then he'd qualify under a separate made condition of end of Life Care instead the psychiatric evaluator said he should be admitted to the hospital for mental health observation Kiana went home but his mother worries he'll continue trying my mom keeps on threatening me my mom's threatening me that she's going to take me to court to take guardianship over me so I can't make this decision and it's clear he is still thinking about it after one conversation he texts me the Apple playlist he put together for his funeral surprisingly upbeat featuring a lot of Kanye West and Drake as more states in the U.S are adding and expanding assisted suicide laws it's worth looking to our closest neighbor to consider how the issue has developed in that nation in some Canadian provinces made accounts for nearly five percent of deaths next year the country will expand its assisted suicide laws for a third time starting in March it will approve requests on the basis of mental illness including depression bipolar disorder and PTSD Parliament is also considering legislation that will make mature minors meaning patients under 18 eligible for all permissible conditions many political analysts predict it will pass but while Canadian polls show that voters overwhelmingly approve of assisted suicide controversy has been mounting for what has been called the most permissive euthanasia regime in the world just this October a national news broadcaster aired a segment on a man who applied for maid to avoid becoming homeless are you afraid to die yeah Amir farsood has applied for medically assisted dying known as maid he lives in constant Agony due to a back injury but has started the process for end of life because his rooming house is up for sale and he can't find anywhere else to live that he can afford his doctor who knows farsoud's real reason for maid is his fear of being homeless signed off on the application in August I don't wish to be dead um even with the pain even with the meds um I still want to be here and a few years ago Scandal erupted after a long-term neurological patient recorded Hospital staff pressuring him to sign up for maid whenever he asked about plans for his ongoing care yes I'd be fine but if you weren't you just you can just apply to get a assisted if you wanted in your life like you don't mean you don't have to do it in some dramatic manner you can apply for a sense of you know what's the plan that you know of Roger I this is not my show I told you my piece of this I'm just to talk to you about if you had interest in assisted dying there was widespread criticism when a 2022 report from Canada's parliamentary budget office estimated that the maid program could save the government nearly 90 million dollars in health care costs many American doctors say this is where the U.S is headed right now physician-assisted suicide is legal in 10 States including blue States like Oregon red States like Montana and purple States like New Mexico for now patients must have a terminal diagnosis to qualify though assisted dying Advocates are pushing to expand that euthanasia where the doctor is the one who administers lethal drugs isn't legal anywhere in the U.S but it's a fine distinction and according to Gallup 72 percent of Americans believe both euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legal hospice physician Dr Leslie Cochran says this is because people have a fundamental misunderstanding of why patients typically seek assisted suicide contrary to popular conception he says pain actually isn't the foremost reason the vast majority of people who end up taking their own life aren't doing it because they're in pain and and being in pain isn't even the top one or two reasons why they ask for it it's autonomy it's not being a burden on their family it's wanting to be able to control the end of their life Cochrane adds that any patients who are concerned about pain can be reassured that it should never be a problem so offering to help someone die on that basis is he says unethical I think it's very bad it's very bad medicine it's very bad ethics uh it's just it's medically unnecessary back to what I said I mean the idea that the only way we can treat pain is by killing patients is preposterous you know there's there's no argument that anyone on the pro side can make against that because it's just there's no argument to it so it's not true you know it's never medically necessary to kill someone to control their pain it there's just no there's no such case that ever exists nurturing patients to choose assisted suicide is the inevitable consequence of allowing any form of euthanasia he believes it fundamentally breaks trust between doctor and patient in countries where euthanasia has been around for a while people are now afraid of their doctors because you know the doctor no longer in some cases seems to need to feel that they need the consent of the patient you know to go forward with euthanasia so it's a it's a spectrum and it's a Continuum and I don't know I don't know how you say that you know once you open the door or once you open Pandora's Box maybe we should say you know the genie is out of the bottle you can't put it back in right now Cochrane is suing California for a religious liberty exemption to allow Governor Gavin Newsom passed last year it requires Physicians who have objections to assisted suicide to refer patients to other doctors who will help them die Cochrane said that too violates his conscience as a Christian I will work tirelessly to make sure that people live with dignity until they take their last breath and I will aggressively manage their symptoms so that they they can be as comfortable as possible but to ask me to intentionally do something with the only intent of killing them it's unthinkable Cochrane and other doctors like him say that assisted suicide is the one decision that can never be undone and doctors sometimes make mistakes I've admitted people to hospice who have graduated because we found out that what we thought was one problem was actually a different problem or they had a life near life-ending stroke and they unexpectedly recovered or a heart attack and they recovered and what a tragedy it would have been if they would have ended their life in two days at a point of despair how much more does that apply to Young patients with non-terminal diagnoses pro-life activists point out that issues like depression and mental illness can be temporary problems while suicide is permanent perhaps that explains why Ontario's regulatory body for Physicians and surgeons is currently considering a new policy that would require doctors to falsify medical records when it comes to maid deaths the policy would mandate that doctors list the disease or disability leading to the request for assisted suicide as the cause of death they would be barred from making any reference to assisted suicide on death certificates critics say this will make it impossible to maintain accurate

Battleground States and where the key races stand I'm daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley with Georgia Howe it's Monday November 7th and this is morning wire are Democrats losing Hispanics the Democrats are in serious trouble if the Republicans reach the 40th percentile with latino voters it's their Coalition it's just not sustainable we look at the data that has some democrat pollsters sounding the alarm and the current slate of Republican congressional candidates is the most diverse the party has ever run we discuss the new look GOP and now shifting support among key demographics could impact the election thanks for waking up with morning wire stay tuned we have the news you need to know [Music] the American economy is still feeling the traumatic effects of a two-year pandemic

President Biden here to give us a rundown of all the action before polls close tomorrow evening as daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot we finally made it we are here where do things stand now well Republicans still have the momentum according to the polls and it appears almost certain that they will come out Tuesday with control of the house but make no mistake about it the fate of the Senate is still a complete toss-up we just don't know what's going to happen there yeah let's start with those races first in Pennsylvania we're Democrat John fetterman had some big guests in town correct he did after opening up with a huge lead over Republican Dr Oz fetterman faltered throughout October giving up ground and in basically every poll and then suffering a major hit after that disastrous debate performance on October 25th now Democrats responded this week by holding a major rally Saturday night in Philadelphia that featured former president Obama as well as President Biden and it's not that surprising think that Obama was there he still is the most popular Democrat in the country but it was a surprise to see Biden there right remember he's really avoided the campaign Trail uh in large part due to his low approval ratings and swing States and Republicans have actually been trying to tie him to Democrat midterm candidates president Trump was also there remember he really helped push Dr Oz Over The Finish Line with his endorsement during the primary and they held a rally together on Saturday the two rallies were kind of a microcosm of the national message from each party Obama and the Democrats said that the election was about the preservation of democracy itself while Trump and Republicans said that it was about fixing a failing economy Oz has been up by two in the last three polls including from our partners at Trafalgar but it's still going to be an incredibly tight Race come Tuesday let's go now to Georgia another close race what's the latest there well the polls there are still all over the place the latest that we have shows Walker up four but just last week there was another that had Warnock up six and then the day before that we saw an exact tie so it's really hard to tell who actually has the upper hand one thing we do know though is that early voter turnout in Georgia is through the roof setting all-time records with 49 of votes cast coming from registered Democrats and 42 coming from Republicans that seven point margin is the smaller lead than Democrats had back in 2020 but keep in mind there's a good chance we will not know the winner of this race until December 6th that's because if neither candidate gets 50 on Tuesday the top two will head to a runoff four weeks from now so keep an eye on that 50 number tomorrow night and so far we haven't seen many polls that show either of them over 50 so there's a good chance that might happen right we'll get to one more Senate race what's going on in Arizona yeah this is yet another race where Republicans had been all but written off over the summer but now appears to be a legitimate toss-up and come to Democrats Senator Mark Kelly has out fundraised Republican Blake Masters 80 million to 12 million and he also came in with a massive name recognition advantage but that has not really mattered Masters closed the Gap over the summer in part because the popularity of Republican gubernatorial nominee Carrie Lake and now the polls show a dead heat okay now to the governor's race everyone is talking about tell us about New York well this is another race where polls are really all over the place still our partners at Trafalgar have it all tied up While others have the Democrat Kathy hokel with as much as a nine point lead but one thing is certain Democrats are clearly very nervous about how close the race has become and you can kind of tell by who they're bringing in to help this week former President Bill Clinton who is still popular with a lot of democrat voters in New York held a rally for hokel that's not really the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a deep blue State the win for Biden by 23 points not at all yeah hokel was also part of a viral moment over the weekend when MSNBC hosts Stephanie rule laid into her on crime in New York City here's the problem we don't feel safe you might be working closely with mayor Adams you may have spent a whole lot of money but I walk into my Pharmacy and everything is on lockdown because of shoplifters I'm not going in the subway people don't feel safe in this town so you may have done these things but right now we're not feeling good we're worried we could be San Francisco some harsh words from an outlet typically viewed as a safe haven for Democrats definitely Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips and we'll hear a lot more from him on daily wire's election night coverage coming up the GOP is gaining ground among Hispanic voters in an

a devastating long-term effect on their electoral fortunes Hispanics are increasingly backing the GOP joining us to discuss is Giancarlo Sopo political strategist and founder of Visto media John Carlo thanks for coming on so we've seen some polls showing that Democrats margin among Latino voters has literally been cut in half over the past few years is that also what you've found and if so are you confident that that's a real effect yeah absolutely so the Democrats won the Hispanic vote by 40 points in 2018 which is consistent with their historical average of winning the Hispanic vote by 36 points in midterm elections and it's been a series of polls not just fine but from the Wall Street Journal the New York Times and others showing that the Republicans have cut significantly into the Democrats lead now my poll was taken at the beginning of this month what polls taken within the last week are showing including a new one from the Wall Street Journal is that the Democrats have lost even more ground with Hispanics in recent weeks now can Democrats afford to lose this many Latino voters they cannot they start really losing ground in States like Nevada New Mexico Colorado and others that it just becomes completely unsustainable for them a good reference point to this when we saw this happen was in 2004 with former President George W bush where he carried the entire American southwest and went on to be re-elected in windy popular vote now another thing that you dug into in your surveys is the different subgroups of Hispanics what were some of the differences that you saw in the different demographics we all know that Cubans tend to be the most conservative Latinos compared to say like Mexicans or Puerto Ricans but there are even more uh differences beyond that when you look at news language consumption Hispanics who get their news in Spanish are far more liberal than those who get it in English so a monkey Spanish who get their news in Spanish the Democrats have a 40-point lead Hispanics who get most of the reviews in English that lead is only down to 13 points and I think that's due to a variety of factors perhaps the most notable one is the two major Spanish networks Univision and Telemundo are incredibly liberal it's like watching MSNBC in Spanish so I'm not surprised that the reviewers tend to be more liberal now what about the assimilation factor I mean if you're watching English language news does that imply that you're more assimilated perhaps second third generation here in the U.S for sure what it was very interesting though is that there's not much of a difference among foreign-born and U.S born Hispanics the real difference is on whether the uh the foreign-born Hispanics if they are watching Spanish television or English language television that's where you see the biggest differences in the voting patterns with Latinos so what are some of the key races that you are going to have your eye on on Election night with regard to the Latino vote sure so we're watching Florida very closely a republican has not carried the Statewide Latino vote in Florida for some time and the polls indicate that Governor DeSantis is on track to win a majority of Hispanics if he wins Miami-Dade County that is lights out at that moment for his Democratic opponent Charlie Chris I'm also paying very close attention to what's happening in South Texas these very tight races with Cassie Garcia a congresswoman Mayra Flores and Monica De La Cruz in the Rio Grande Valley that's going to be a really interesting indicator as to how how much ground Republicans have made with Hispanic voters all right well Giancarlo thanks so much for coming on today that was John Carlos Sopo political strategist and founder of Visto media [Music] as the 2022 midterm cycle winds down this week one phenomenon that has been widely noted is the rise of a much more diverse slate of Republican candidates than we've seen in the past according to a New York Times report there are 67 black Latino or Asian candidates seeking congressional seats in the grand old party this compared to about a dozen current sitting members of color here to discuss the sea change in the Republican party is columnist David Marcus our Dave how did we get here how did we arrive at a GOP with so much diversity good morning uh yeah it's a great question and maybe the most important one in all of American politics just at the moment there was a a famous postmortem done in 2012 after Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama in which most establishment Republicans called for outreach specifically to the Hispanic community at the time they thought the way to do it was to soften language and positions on illegal immigrations in the Border that didn't happen because instead we got Donald Trump maybe the greatest border Hawk of all time and he won the nomination in 2016. what nobody saw coming was that Trump notwithstanding this harsh rhetoric would actually bring Hispanic voters into the party yeah that certainly surprised a lot of people who are some of the GOP candidates who represent this shift and what are they saying specifically about the Border well the best examples are three literal wives of Border agents running in typically blue districts in southern Texas these are Irene armaderas Jackson Myra Flores and Cassie Garcia and look they're running to secure the Border plain and simple it's not identity politics these voters especially near the border towns and I've interviewed them they want a system that works not utter chaos and that Republican message is resonating right we just looked at polling that shows the GOP getting a lot more Hispanic support this year now it's not just Hispanic votes being courted by Republicans we've also seen Outreach to the Asian Community any impact there well there seems to be I mean for example there's a much tighter race than expected for a house seat in Rhode Island where Alan Fong is trying to pick up a blue District we see some similar races elsewhere education is an issue where Republicans see an opening especially in big cities where Democrat efforts to diversify top public schools have a tendency to harm Asian students more than others and that also comes with the backdrop of the supreme court hearing a case on affirmative action so conservative see an opening here and there's been some success how much of this growth within communities of color for Republicans is rooted in these sort of ethnic specific issues as opposed to the broader message of both parties right now I mean that's that's fascinating I mean there's there's been a Spate of articles about how Latino voters for example poll very much like the average voter and when you look at polling of Democrats writ large whites with a college degree are by far the most Progressive cohort there's been a basic assumption for a few decades now that voters of color go in for wokeness and far left policies that assumption is falling apart and I think we can expect Democrats to have their own 2012 style post-mortem about the heavy losses they're taking in these demographic groups now one voting block where Democrats have held more of their advantage is with the black vote why is that so much steadier and are Republicans making Indian roads I've made some inroads especially with black men but but yes I mean this is still the blue firewall and look not to beat a dead horse or donkey as the case may be but once again on cultural issues like the trans issue and on kitchen table issues today's Democrat Party at least it's institutional leaders and spokespeople are so far left that they might start to leave a considerable number of black voters behind back in the center open to filling in a bubble for Republican that would be huge indeed it would thank you for joining us David that was daily wire contributor David Marcus foreign we're tracking this week more than 39 million Americans had

Weinstein is currently on trial for a second time in Los Angeles some evidence suggests that the movement's Legacy may not be as enduring as many activists hoped here to provide some context and Analysis is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan me too was one of the biggest cultural juggernauts of the last few years we certainly saw it make a lot of headlines and a lot of people were held accountable I'm thinking of course of big names like Bill Cosby Matt Lauer CBS Chief Les moonves but we're starting to see some headlines saying that the world is moving on from me too why is that yeah we are and I think there are a few reasons for that um one is that in 2017 the kind of allegations we were talking about were very clear-cut we had accusations of rape uh things like drugging women of really egregious sexual harassment at work so I think at that point people across the political aisle were on board and they agreed that there needed to be a reckoning for that kind of behavior but then as the movement progressed the claims became somewhat muddier some of them seem to involve women upset over sexual acts that were consensual but where they didn't feel that the men involved behaved as respectfully as they might have wanted we saw that for example in the case of comedian Aziz Ansari there the woman conceded that she did agree to oral sex but she regretted it later and and then even more polarizing was that lawsuit between actress Amber Heard and Johnny Depp we'll all recall that in 2018 at the height of the metoo movement Hurd presented herself as a victim of domestic abuse in an op-ed for the Washington Post and she received a lot of support in Hollywood for that Depp was effectively canceled and he lost huge movie contracts but when a jury finally got the chance to see all of the details They concluded that heard was lying so now we're starting to see some polling that reflects some skepticism a lot of people are saying they think that me too went too far and then last month a new Pew survey found that only about half of Americans say they support the metoo movement now that number was around 64 percent in 2018 and among those who say they now oppose it the top reasons given were that they don't think it respects due process and that it doesn't weed out false accusations well there's also a bit of a generational shift there's been some reporting that gen Z just isn't as focused on this as Millennials were right and in the latest polling on issues that gen Z cares about sexual harassment and assault don't make the list at all instead they say they're concerned about things like jobs the economy cost of living in a recent special on NBC's Meet the Press some young college women were saying that their perception is that me too was about protecting famous women it was never me too when you know something happened on a college campus it wasn't me too when someone just went to work at a regular corporate office it's not me too when maybe it's a black man saying that he was assaulted and then there's no question the movement took a huge reputational hit last year that was when news broke that leaders of a Hollywood founded metoo group called time's up helped New York Governor Andrew Cuomo discredit an accuser in that case a host of A-list women kept quiet about the revelations that included Eva Longoria Natalie Portman Emma Stone Reese Witherspoon really top level people so you saw a lot of accused nations of hypocrisy stemming from that now is it possible that some people just think the metoo movement accomplished what it's set out to do and just maybe it's not needed anymore yeah I think that's possible and I think that is a positive angle that you can look at this through uh one more thing that that Pew poll that was released just a few weeks ago found was that about 60 percent of people say that when people report harassment or assault at work now they're more likely to be believed and even among those who oppose the metoo movement that was still the majority of you well it's always interesting to Benchmark the feminist movement over the years because it just really shows how fast the culture can change in such a short time Megan thanks for reporting yeah anytime that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham [Music] debates over parents rights and new reports showing a significant decline in students performance in recent years have put education at the Forefront in the upcoming election joining us to discuss is Virginia governor Glenn Younkin who made education reform a centerpiece of his campaign last year and now his governorship Governor welcome first we've recently received the national report card showing students really struggling on a national level and all the key subject matters this is obviously concerning do you think this is more about the pandemic response or is it something deeper let me back up and just put it into context about how horrific and heartbreaking these results were particularly in Virginia so when we look at fourth grade reading and math Virginia fell further than any other state in Reading three times further than the average and was tied for last with Maryland and this decline is a decline that started before the pandemic decisions made by previous administrations had put Virginia on a downward path and these decisions were clear they reduced the accountability by blurring what what accreditation means I mean we have 85 percent of our schools today that that hit the highest accreditation standard and yet we had horrific test scores all year and by the way these nape scores are just the next and very loud alarm bells that have been ringing all year on tests taken last year and and so these scores should be wake-up call for the nation and we've got to get to work we started on January 1st uh with my first executive order which first targeted making sure we do not have divisive teaching practices in the classroom and get the politics out and get reading and math and history and science back in the classroom we passed a bipartisan bill on the Virginia literacy act to make sure that all K through third graders can learn to read this is critical and particularly when you see that these averages that the nape scores represent reflect even worse performance in the economically disadvantaged communities where English could be a second language with kids with disabilities in Black communities and Hispanic communities this is just a moment for the nation and particularly Virginia to wake up now you've passed a series of measures to address a lot of issues in education one of them is requiring parental consent if a child wants to be referred to as a different gender how much pushback have you gotten for those parents rights policies well let me begin with getting parents back not just at the table but at the head of the table in their children's lives was at the heart of the movement last year that Virginians stood up and expressed in electing me and by the way it wasn't Republicans versus Democrats it was Virginians we won the majority of the independent vote Democrats walked across the aisle and did something nobody expected and at the heart of it was a government that had forgotten that they worked for the people and so we passed a bipartisan Bill to allow parents to decide whether their children wears a mask we passed a bipartisan bill to make sure that there's transparency in the classroom materials and if the materials are sexually explicit and they don't fit with your family values you can ask for those materials to be removed from your child's curriculum I mean now we're working to make sure that in this most important decision where a child is questioning their birth gender that there can be no exception to the fact that parents have to be involved in that decision and a previous administration had done an immense wrong to parents and to families by excluding parents from that decision specifically kids deserve a parent in their life parents have a right to be in their children's lives not to the exclusion of a trusted teacher or trusted trusted counselor but that decision must be made with parents and the reality of course is this is not controversial and we see huge huge support for this front yes there are a bunch of special interest groups who are disagreeing but children do not belong to the state they belong to families final question how much do you think education is going to play a role in Tuesday's elections I'm gonna play a huge role in the midterm elections we've seen systematically across Virginia and Across the Nation this effort to water down expectations to change curriculum away from critical reading and critical math and critical history and critical science to topics that aren't preparing our kids for life and to push parents out of their children's lives and this concerted effort that has gone on across the nation has brought people together not Republicans versus Democrats but parents Aunts Uncles grandparents siblings and we're seeing it reflected in the polls I think that there's a clear understanding that Common Sense here has to get back in the classroom all right Governor well thank you so much for joining us that was Virginia governor Glenn youngin [Music] numbers over the last few years prompting a lot of questions about the state's deteriorating business environment a new report from the Hoover institution highlights the mass departure of companies from the state and the policies that could be contributing to the shift here to discuss is Delaware's Charlotte Pence Bond Charlotte what did this report say so the report looked at over 300 California business headquarters that moved away from the Golden State between 2018 to 2021 it found that the amount of companies leaving has gone up significantly over that time last year the monthly average of California headquarters leaving was around twice as much as it was in 2020 and 2019 and it was about three times as high as four years ago in 2018. all right so sort of an exponential increase there where are these companies going the leading states that are taking in these companies are Texas Tennessee Nevada Florida and Arizona the report also looked at other types of data to examine the shift this included the number of new capital projects which are places like factories call centers back offices and other facilities Texas Ohio Georgia Illinois and North Carolina were the top states for new projects like this we've reported on a lot of issues that have plagued the state but Are there specific reasons discussed in the report as to why these companies are feeling the need to leave a lot of it has to do with policy the report said that high taxes regulations and high labor costs are all contributing to the exits but the other side is just the high cost of living for Californians these aren't just big businesses leaving either small companies are moving as our Fortune 1000 companies 11 of those left in the time period studied the departure of small businesses from the state can have a really significant impact on local economies and make it less desirable for people to live in certain regions this can hurt school funding and Community Development which takes us to the next point we're seeing that businesses aren't the only ones leaving people are packing up and moving too after the 2020 census California lost one of its House Seats in Congress for the first time ever the state's net domestic migrations was thirty four thousand ten years ago but last year it was 277 000. how are the state's political leaders responding to these rather significant losses while Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom is still touting the state's success numbers headlines because its GDP is now set to become the fourth largest on the planet ousting Germany but its GDP has actually gone down this year it went down 9.5 percent in the first quarter of 2022 and another 0.5 percent in the second quarter a state report pointed to declines in salaries this year

Wednesday the Senate voted on the respect for Marriage Act a bill that enshrines same-sex marriage into law but Faith groups warned that the bill poses a major threat to religious liberty here to explain what's in the bill and the wider implications is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan correct me if I'm wrong gay marriage has been legal since the obergfell decision so does this bill actually change anything it has gay marriage has been legal since 2015 but what this bill does is fortify that so basically LGBT activists were concerned that the Dobbs decision opened the door to peel back some of those marriage rights they were concerned for a couple of reasons first because the majority opinion specifically stated that the court can't establish constitutional rights where the Constitution hasn't spoken and that would include marriage but I'll note in the majority Dobb's opinion the justice has made a clear caveat that it would not apply to same-sex marriage but to that activists pointed to Justice Clarence Thomas's concurrence which did seem to Signal a willingness to reconsider obergefell so activists felt like a bill like this was needed to enshrine gay marriage into law but as John mentioned at the top there's also concern that this bill erodes religious liberty right critics of the bill say that its true purpose is to make any religious convictions regarding traditional marriage unacceptable in the Public Square and to give you just a couple of examples they say the bill will allow the government to take away the tax-exempt status of religious organizations like adoption or foster care services and they say it could block religious schools or colleges from receiving federal grants or it could block christian-owned businesses from receiving government contracts Roger Severino is an attorney who worked in the doj in the Obama Administration and then led the civil rights office under Trump and he told me that the bill does not confer any new protections to same-sex couples but it could open the door to a loss of Rights for religious people the point is to empower activists to have the legal authority to harass by lawsuits people in institutions of Faith who disagree with them on the question of marriage that's it and it should also be noted that the bill links gay marriage and interracial marriage in that it says it's designed to protect both so sort of implying there that their equivalent and that those who would object to same-sex marriage are on the same moral footing as segregationists now a bipartisan group of senators that included three Republicans Tom Tillis of North Carolina Susan Collins of Maine and Rob Portman of Ohio made some changes to the bill that they said addressed concerns that this could infringe on religious liberty but critics say the protections it offers are fairly vague and they are fearful that they'll mostly be limited to churches not other religious organizations or individuals so all in the bill easily cleared the 60 vote threshold on Wednesday to advance the legislation 62-37 so not close 12 Republican Senators joined the Democrats in passing the bill including Iowa's Joni Ernst Alaska's Lisa murkowski and Utah's Mitt Romney well that margin is also really significant considering that gay marriage was opposed by the majority of Americans just about a decade ago whereas now this is considered a winning issue for politicians exactly right and on that note even some of the staunchest holdouts have come out in favor of this bill to give you one example the Mormon Church put out an endorsement on Wednesday so we could see a final vote as soon as the end of this week essentially what we know is that Democrats are going to want to send this back to the house as quickly as possible before those incoming Republicans take control Megan thanks for reporting that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham coming up the FBI now suspects that former president Trump was not up to something nefarious with those classified documents hey everyone producer Colton here due to a shrinking herd beef prices are expected to rise another 15 in 2023 that's why I and many of us here

information regarding the classified documents seized from Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in Florida according to sources close to the investigation into the former president's handling of official classified documents the reason that Trump took possession of these documents was not so much nefarious as nostalgic the post sources say that Trump wanted trophies and mementos joining us to discuss the Revelation as communist David Marcus so David after all the commotion and clamor were these just souvenirs good morning uh according to the post it seems that way uh Trump was as we know a rather unconventional president and often skirted rules and regulations possibly at times because he just wasn't aware of them a couple of months ago we saw the dramatic raid on Mar-A-Lago and the seizure of the documents there was talk of nuclear secrets or potential business dealings but if wapo has the story right it's far more innocuous classified documents are classified documents but this is feeling more like stashing away some peanuts from Air Force One than undermining democracy right now how much does intent matter here if Trump was not planning to use any of the classified material for his personal Advantage is he off the hook on being in possession of them no mishandling classified material can be criminal regardless of intent but that having been said for the Department of Justice to bring charges against Trump would be a huge move especially uh given that he's now officially a candidate again if this reporting is accurate and these really were just keepsakes um then it it might not affect a jury's decision but in the court of public opinion an effort to prosecute Trump might just look like a political operation and that perception is something that attorney general Merrick Garland in his office want to avoid at all costs right now the report also indicated that some of these documents were very sensitive dealing with Iran's missile program and the nuclear capabilities of foreign Nations how does that square with the idea that these are just keepsakes yeah mementos or momentous I don't know throughout Trump's presidency there were often reports of him you know asking advisors if he could do things that presidents aren't actually allowed to do this goes right up to his belief that Mike Pence could change the outcome of the 2020 election generally his advisers were able to say hey Mr President you can't actually do that uh but regarding these documents they wound up in his private residence and look there's real questions as to how and why now this news about the classified documents dropped after the election and the day before Trump announced at Mar-A-Lago no less how does news coverage like this play into that announcement and his prospects it's been fascinating to watch media reaction to all of this the New York Post is continuing its troll campaign against Trump with the cover on Wednesday that had a tiny little Banner at the bottom saying Florida man makes announcement right uh NPR is tweeting about threats to democracy and you know here Washington Post seems to be running something that that maybe helps Trump the edifying question here may not be why is wapo running this but why is this information leaked to them and how uh there's a sense among many observers that Democrats want to run against Donald Trump in 2024 and that the rails leading to that might get greased a little bit the bottom line is that the the Trump show is back on TV for another action-packed season like it or not Dave thanks for coming on thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus Victory reports about a missile strike in Poland have escalated tensions over Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine joining us to discuss is Victoria Coates senior fellow of international Affairs and National Security at Heritage all right Victoria we've seen a lot of reports about the missile strike in Poland and a lot of confusion about its source what do we know about that strike while there are a lot of conflicting reports John uh you have the Polish president Duda and the Americans coming out and saying they're pretty certain it was a misfire from a Ukrainian s-300 we've also had reports that President zielinski thinks that maybe it wasn't a Ukrainian missile and once the further investigation in many ways doesn't matter because the only reason that s 300 was activated if it was the Ukrainian it was because of Vladimir Putin's Invasion and his uh unleashing a barrage of 90 missiles on Tuesday against civilian Ukrainian targets he's the one who's culpable here either way there's been a lot of warnings from officials about how close some of Russia's military strikes are to Poland and endangering other NATO countries how has NATO responded to the developments this week well I think as part of the good news of this whole situation is that NATO has been extremely United and stalwart throughout this entire situation and we have you know excellent reports of of NATO resolve here and so we may have dodged the proverbial bullet on this particular attack but there's no indication that the Russians are going to stop this extremely irresponsible Behavior now the U.S has authorized 54 billion in Military and non-military aid for Ukraine since March and now Biden is asking for about 38 billion more what are we to make of this level of funding for the role of the U.S in this war well it's really it's remarkable I think the questions that the house folks are going to have is you know we've never done this before as a country where we have funded to such a degree a side in a war to which we are not party so as we creep ever closer to the 100 billion dollar Mark here so much of which is not for military aid I think the American people have to ask the administration for a strategy they have to ask you know how do we win this War I mean I none of us want to be on a hair trigger about the third world war breaking out uh in perpetuity we need the the president to give us a strategy for victory and then give the ukrainians what they need to win the war where do we see this going is NATO going to have to get more directly involved at some point and do we see the U.S being dragged into this militarily well I mean that and not only what we don't want to have happened John I mean we would like to see you know this wind up on the terms that the ukrainians have set which is that they would like robust military supply help but they don't want foreign soldiers on their soil they want to defend themselves uh from this threat and they've shown themselves capable of doing it the incident this week however I think is a pretty dire warning to all of us that that could change in a moment because of something beyond our control and Putin very irresponsibly put nuclear weapons on the table during the first week of this conflict when he said he'd be willing to use them and he's probably made his decision about whether or not he's going to use nukes that what we do probably won't make a huge amount of difference there we just have to set our goals uh first and foremost and then push on towards them well Victoria thank you so much for joining us that was Heritage Senior fellow Victoria Coates [Music] this week first at the University of Houston claim they've developed a three-dose vaccine

the race for governor between incumbent Democrat Kathy hokel and Republican Challenger Lee zeldin has emerged as the biggest potential surprise of the midterm cycle with just days to go before the election and early voting already started in the Empire State hokel's lead which had been over 20 points in some polls just two months ago has evaporated down to the margin of error with some surveys even putting zeldon ahead joining us to discuss his columnist David Marcus morning Dave what is hokel doing to try to reverse these trends good morning um the word on the street and in the papers really is that hogle's campaign is in absolute panic mode for the polls to have moved this much this swiftly it's just rare and clearly exposes the Groundswell of support for zeldon hogle's trying to Pivot to addressing the crime problems plaguing New York but it's nothing too rather conflicting messages one that crime isn't actually as bad as Zelda and others make it out to be but also that she's aggressively combating it that's a very hard line to walk in thus far she hasn't been very successful are the candidates debated last week and this issue was at the four at one point hokel asked silden why he cares so much about this issue which zeldon has seized on did the debate move the needle the answer was very strange and gets back to this mixed message from hokel a zeldon already has ads Up featuring uh her answer and it just looks badly out of touch what everyone thinks of the regular stream of violent viral videos from New York City especially in the mass transit system they aren't made up and talking to voters there a lot I'd say most in fact see this as an existential crisis for the city hokel's running ads claiming she fixed bail reform which is a very odd claim but she won't really commit to the kind of overhaul and criminal justice that zeldon is promising on day one when he says he will declare a crime emergency and fire several Progressive prosecutors uh who he says aren't doing their job and it's not just the governor's race that's garnering attention in New York there are also a Spate of house races that seem to be leaning to the GOP now are these races influencing each other as election day approaches oh for sure um even Sean Patrick Maloney who's the head of the D Triple C the the Democrat Congressional group in charge of winning House Seats is facing potential defeat in a race that should be an easy win for Democrats uh they're spending a lot of money on that seat and a few others they want to hold meanwhile they seem to have given up on GOP held seats such as New York 11 where Max Rose is attempting to win back his seat from Republican Nicole maliotakis and yes these races are fueling each other zeldin gains when people get out to vote for GOP house candidates and those house candidates are also going to get some coattail support from zeldon so look the Republicans are all in here now zelding has gotten some help from a couple of national Republican figures rallying this weekend with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Virginia governor Glenn youngin is there a risk for zeldon in nationalizing this race which he's so far just fought squarely over New York focused issues yes but probably I mean DeSantis in particular can be a polarizing figure and he's someone Joe Biden and Democrats has slung a lot of mud at but look zeldin also has a base to appease and the rally with DeSantis had about 10 000 people there that's something Statewide elections in New York have not seen in some time so zeldin's folks see more reward than risk here so not to put you in a tough spot but any predictions from the ground there in New York hey I'm I'm already on the record in Daily wire saying I think zeldon wins this thing it's not just that polls tend to overweigh Democrats support though that seems to be true it's also just what you're hearing on the ground the frustration is palpable and real and Hogle doesn't seem to have an answer for it well this will certainly be a fascinating race to watch election night thank you for joining us Dave that was daily wire contributor David Marcus coming up leaked documents from

social media joining us to discuss is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan I thought the Biden administration's Ministry of Truth idea was scrapped how is this not the same thing well you know this is technically different from the proposed disinformation governance board but it's still very much in the same vein but more expansive also you have to say that this is not a proposal it's something that's already in place and has actually been so for some time so DHS has been monitoring social media for a while but prior to the 2020 election the department began partnering with big Tech in a more formal way in 2018 DHS created a sub-department called the cyber security and infrastructure Security Agency siza and saiza has reportedly been having weekly meetings with social media staffers one example of the agenda items siza asked Twitter to quote process reports and provide timely responses to include the removal of reported misinformation from the platform where possible so almost sounding like siza was giving Twitter orders there and some of the subject matter DHS has been monitoring are the origins of the pandemic the effectiveness of covid vaccines racial hate uh the Biden administration's Afghanistan withdrawal and U.S support for the war in Ukraine but according to the intercept DHS doesn't clearly Define what qualifies as disinformation in all of these categories and they report that this has created a broad opening for DHS to act out of political motivations so for example some of the material they wanted censored came from accounts that were explicitly labeled as parity so essentially DHS was asking big Tech to suppress jokes and it's important to note here that The Intercept is widely perceived as a left-leaning publication not conservative so what were the sources that The Intercept used for this report well some of the material came from official public records and some leaked memos but a lot of it was from Discovery material from a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmidt Schmidt described on Fox News recently part of what his office found in those records there's direct communication from a senior level Facebook executive these uh government officials over 50 of them that we've been able to determine so far have been given direct access in what's called special flagging status to almost on by themselves go down and take people you know de-platform them so what Schmidt's talking about here is that special portal that allows DHS to flag posts or users directly on Facebook or Instagram and request that it be taken down or suppressed and that portal is still active by the way I checked it myself this morning one of the biggest findings though is arguably about the FBI agent who pressured social media platforms to censor the hunter Biden laptop story even after that debacle he continued to have a hand in setting this DHS policy so do we know whether the government was or is actively pressuring tech companies to act as sensors or did these companies pursue this partnership with the government you know based on this report it appears to be a little bit of both depending on what company you're talking about to give you one example a text from a Microsoft executive to a DHS official in February said I'm just going to quote platforms have got to get comfortable with government it's really interesting how hesitant they remain now it didn't specify which companies have been hesitant but the report shows that other big Tech Executives fully embraced this Arrangement up until last week vidyagade set content moderation policies at Twitter as its head of legal and policy Elon Musk actually fired her and there are differences of opinion on censoring online speech appeared to have played a pretty big role in that decision it turns out that while she was an executive at Twitter got a was also meeting monthly with the Biden Administration she also helped write a report that recommended DHS expand its effort to police the what she called information ecosystem so has there been any response from Big Tech or from the Biden Administration since this report came out nothing from the administration or DHS yet and Twitter is the only social media company to respond so far they said that they don't coordinate with other entities regarding their moderation decisions and they evaluate whether posts break Twitter's rules independently right well and whatever policies they had in place before those are probably likely to change right yeah Megan thanks so much for reporting that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham a new report highlights what it calls the dramatic disconnect between teachers union leadership and teachers themselves nearly all of the money teachers unions spent on political activity went to one political party in 2020 while less than half of their members say they support that party here with the details is Eric Eggers from the drill down podcast and the government accountability Institute which issued the report warninger hey good morning John so gai has issued a new report on the financial and political activities of the two largest teachers unions in the country what'd you find so I think there are a few big things this new report reveals first our new report reveals that the teachers unions have seen a dramatic increase in their political spending while the actual work to represent their members has stayed relatively static so for example over the last 16 years the National Education Association and the American Federation of teachers which are the two biggest teachers unions in this country spent 74 million more on political activities but over that same time period spending on membership issues or what they call representational activities increased only 5 million so a massive ramp up in political spending but not much more spending on activities for members no that's exactly right and your report also indicates that the increase in political spending was not evenly distributed at all no it wasn't the unions gave 59 million in political contributions in the 2020 election cycle nearly all of it or a hundred percent of the money went to Democrat or liberal organizations with some fairly radical positions despite the fact that and this is according to their own surveys 57 percent of union members identify as either independent or as a Republican all right so a majority don't even agree with uh you know backing Democrats you cite some radical positions supported by some of these groups what are some examples there one of the groups called Center for popular democracy got two million dollars from the unions and they brag about their efforts to harass elected officials during the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings for example among other activities another group color of change pack got a hundred thousand dollars they opposed police unions overtly calling them quote killer cop organizations that is pretty radical you said recent news about our education system puts your report into some important context you're talking about the most recent results of the national testing for naep which is called the nation's report card what did that show yeah that's right unfortunately the test results show that the pandemic era school closures and other educational disruptions have essentially wiped out two decades worth of progress in terms of test scores and Black and Hispanic students have been hit the hardest their test scores dropped seven points where their white student scores on average dropped less than half that and so given the fact that many experts say the scores among the nine-year-olds that participate in this test essentially predict the educational trajectory for these kids some worry that these results essentially predict an overall decline in academic success for an entire emerging generation due to the coveted pandemic so ironically the union spent a lot of money politically to support groups fighting for racial justice but at the same time they've advocated for policies like school closures that have conceptually caused irreparable harm to a generation of minority students again not something a lot of parents will be happy to hear I'm sure Eric thanks for joining us that's Eric Eggers of the government accountability Institute and co-host of the drill down podcast [Music] another story we're tracking this week the FCC is recommending that the federal government completely ban social media platform Tick Tock because there is no

no time making clear that there's a new sheriff in town on Wednesday he changed his Twitter bio to read Chief twit he also posted a video of himself carrying a sink into Twitter headquarters which many took as a reference to Kitchen sinking in the business world the term means radical changes are coming daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham joins us now to tell us what the world can expect from Twitter in the musk era so Megan this has been a winding road but Elon is finally taking over at Twitter I think the first thing everyone is wondering is what kind of changes is Elon going to make yes and I will say that as an avid Twitter user myself I have been keeping close tabs on that and the first change is a major shake up at the top now there are conflicting reports about whether musk fired several key Executives or they simply resigned but what we do know is that CEO parag agrawal Chief Financial Officer Ned Siegel head of policy vijayakade and general counsel Sean edgett are all out and it's important to note that these were the people who decided to kick former president Donald Trump off the platform and that's something musk has called a mistake now in terms of how the platform itself will change I'd say there are really two big areas one is monetization Twitter is currently not profitable and it really hasn't been for years and second loosening ideological censorship we all remember of course that what seemed to initiate this entire roller coaster was Twitter Banning The Babylon B that's a conservative satire site that musk is a big fan of and then at several points while the deal was pending he talked about the importance of free speech and made it clear that he disagreed with some of Twitter's censorship decisions this was musk addressing the issue back in May shortly after his initial offer to buy Twitter I don't think people that they're necessarily intend I would be have some of them don't attend to to have a life bias they just from their perspective it seems moderate but they're just coming at it from an environment that is that is very far left so this fails to build trust into in the rest of the United States and and also and perhaps in other parts of the world so musk stuck with that theme this week as he officially took the Reigns on Wednesday he tweeted a beautiful thing about Twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias and then in another post he criticized traditional news media saying that it fuels and caters to polarized extreme times on both the left and the right now I know there's been some concern from investors that if musk scales back content moderation too much then offensive material might flood everywhere on the platform and that's going to scare off advertisers is there any Merit to that yeah there is that is definitely a concern and musk already seems to be trying to assuage those fears on Thursday he posted an open letter to advertisers and in it he affirmed his commitment to open dialogue he said that the reason he acquired Twitter is because it's important to the future of civilization to have a common digital Square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated but he tempered that by assuring companies that doesn't mean the platform is going to become a free-for-all hellscape those are his words where anything can be said with no consequences and he added that Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world and that it's going to allow companies to strengthen their brands and grow their Enterprises now what about monetization for users is Twitter going to be following that Trend yeah it definitely looks like it uh to give you one example when conservative rapper zubi tweeted that Twitter should find a way for top creators to make money off their accounts as you tend to see on Instagram and Tick Tock musk replied absolutely and then a huge change that happened this week but that musk has actually been hinting at for a while Twitter finally added an edit button for premium subscribers so now to the elephant in the room how are Twitter employees responding to their new boss well I think you have to say that they don't seem very excited about the change in leadership so the Washington Post reported last week that musk was planning to lay off 75 of Twitter's Workforce now he denied that but a group of Twitter employees published an open letter that you have to say was fairly aggressive in Tone It accused musk of trying to intimidate workers and demanding he dropped any threats of layoffs they also demanded and I want to be clear that was their word we demand that they be able to continue working remotely and they demanded that musk not discriminate against them on the basis of political beliefs now Twitter has faced serious financial difficulties in the past but the office is famous for offering some pretty Posh perks including pet insurance free Chef prepared lunches and dinners a bar with alcohol on tap and five months of paid maternity and paternity leave so this is despite the fact that the company has rarely turned a profit so good chance that some of those things are going to fall by the wayside right well Megan thanks so much for reporting that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham coming up the funding scheme for a progressive backed federal bureau is ruled unconstitutional [Music] the American economy is still feeling the traumatic effects of a two-year pandemic and lockdown induced recession polls show that 94 percent of Americans are upset or concerned about the impact of rising prices 95 percent believe the soaring inflation is very serious or somewhat serious the bottom line is that impending recession

protect your hard-earned savings with gold text w-i-r-e to 989898 to claim your free no obligation information kit on how to protect your hard-earned savings with gold a recent ruling in the fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a powerful obama-era agency that was championed by Progressive lawmakers as a means of protecting consumers is unconstitutional the decision is facing criticism from proponents of the agency such as Senator Elizabeth Warren who created the group after the ruling she tweeted that it was lawless and Reckless calling the judges extreme and right wing here to discuss is daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond so Charlotte what did the court take issue with here well essentially the very existence of the bureau at least in how it's funded the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or cfpb was as you mentioned created in 2010 by Elizabeth Warren before she was a Senator it was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act and it gets its funding from the Federal Reserve not from bills passed by Congress it was essentially formed after the financial crisis and it's supposed to safeguard Americans from being mistreated by Financial companies originally the President also couldn't get rid of the head of the cfpb even though it's a government agency but the Supreme Court ruled against that in 2020. a Payday Lending Group brought this case to the court three judges on the panel sided with them regarding a 2017 regulation but they made a more significant decision too they said that the way the cfpb is funded violates the Constitution the judges wrote quote congress's decision to abdicate its Appropriations power under the Constitution I.E to cede its power of purse to the bureau violates the Constitution's structural separation of powers so this Bureau did not have proper accountability to Congress in terms of financially right now some listeners might have some degree of knowledge about the cfpb but can you remind us what exactly the agency does yes it describes itself as designed to quoting here protect consumers from unfair deceptive or abusive practices and take action against companies that break the law so a pretty sweeping and open-ended mandate there I spoke to Giancarlo cataparo a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation about the cfpb and he explained it this way it was given broad Regulatory and enforcement power over not only the financial industry but Industries touching on the financial industry payments credit cards and a lot of other things that are related to what's broadly referred to as consumer protection issues and how it's financially structured is the main thing that you hear in this ruling kanapara pointed out that it gets its money directly from the Federal Reserve and the FED has to give it up to 12 of the fed's entire operating budget so Congress and taxpayers have no say in how much it actually gets only the upward cap and how is the cfpb responding to this ruling unsurprisingly it's defending itself it's said in a statement that there is nothing novel or unusual about congress's decision to fund the cfpb outside of annual spending bills but kanaparao says that misses the entire point if there are other agencies as the cfpb Director contends that have this same funding mechanism or something substantially similar the answer is not that that renders the cfpb's action of the cftb structure constitutionally it throws doubt on whether there's other agencies funding structure is constitutional conoboro says he thinks the cfpb pretty much has to appeal the ruling but that could go badly for them if it goes to the Supreme Court in the other case that went before the high court five justices also had their doubts about how it was funded so it sounds like this could have a lot of implications moving forward Sean thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond [Music] the state of Pennsylvania is Ground Zero for the midterm elections the senate race is at the Forefront of the national news but the gubernatorial contest could be just as important joining us to discuss the unexpectedly heated race for governor of Pennsylvania is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim first off tell us about the different candidates sure Pennsylvania's Governor's seat is open as the current governor democrat Tom Wolf is term limited out State Attorney General Josh Shapiro is the Democratic nominee to replace him Shapiro ran unopposed on the Democratic primary but that wasn't the case on the Republican side state senator Doug mastriano won the GOP Primary against former Congressman Lou Barletta and a crowd of other candidates by more than 20 percent mastriano enter politics three years ago with a seat in the Pennsylvania legislature he spent most of the past four decades in the U.S army where he reached the rank of Colonel okay so those are the candidates how's the race shaping up right now a lot of Grassroots conservatives are backing mastriano establishment Republicans have been more hesitant because mastriana was at the U.S Capitol during the January 6 riots and the Republican Governors Association hasn't supported mastriano financially on the other hand Shapiro is the best funded gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania history he spent over 40 million dollars so far and has 11 million in the bank in comparison mastriano has spent just 3 million and has 2.6 million dollars left so a huge financial Edge for Shapiro right and it appears to be paying off Rasmussen has Shapiro up three and Insider Advantage has them up seven that said like a lot of Republicans over the past few weeks mastriano is gaining ground a recent survey from the market research company WIC found that Shapiro's lead had shrunk to just two points well within the margin of error interesting so what are the campaign platforms on each side mastriano is not shy about his social conservatism one of his campaign ads is a three-minute dive into Shapiro's ties to groups that promote radical gender theory in the classroom masterano then uses that as a springboard to push school choice the ad which is pretty graphic portrays mastriano as the candidate for parents of young kids after the ad dropped Shapiro actually added language to his campaign website in support of a piece of school choice legislation that was a pretty significant pivot especially given he's backed by progressives and teachers unions school choice is pretty popular nearly three quarters of registered voters support it that's probably why we're seeing a similar pivot from other Progressive Democrats such as Illinois governor JB pritzker okay so what about Shapiro what are his main issues Shapiro was focused on abortion access like many Democrats he's relying on the backlash to the overturning of Roe v Wade this summer most of his ads highlight mastriano's pro-life position mastriana wrote Pennsylvania's heartbeat bill which would regulate abortion after six weeks now earlier this year there was also some controversy about the fact that Shapiro actually donated to mastriano during the GOP Primary what was the strategy there yeah this was a controversial strategy that Democrats tried in several races across the country they propped up Mega Republicans thinking they would be the easiest to beat if mastriana wins it will be a bitter pill for progressives in the state that's becoming more likely a lot of activists on the ground have warned that as more pennsylvanians are pinched by the economy the better mastriano's chances become well it's definitely a race we're going to keep an eye on Tim thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Tim Pierce foreign we're tracking

on two affirmative action cases on Monday one that involves Harvard University and another relating to the University of North Carolina's admissions policies joining us to discuss is Sarah partial Perry senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation okay so Sarah we have major affirmative action cases in front of the court here first tell us about these cases who brought the suits and who are the defendants well the individual group that have brought the suit in both cases is an organization called students for Fair admission and they claim about 20 000 members nationwide at colleges and University campuses uh Coast to Coast but they have each brought two individual claims against both UMC which is a public university University of North Carolina and Harvard College which is a private university and they've alleged similar though not identical claims both based on race discrimination the first being in the UNC case a violation of the Constitution's equal protection clause in the 14th Amendment and at the Harvard case a violation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act which prevents any race discrimination in any federally funded program related to education so what arguments did we hear presented Monday from both sides well we've heard quite a number of attorneys yet I've been speak today because there was a group of students who intervened in the lawsuit at UNC they have cited not only with solicitor general for the United States Elizabeth pre-logger but also for the solicitor general for the state of North Carolina Mr Park the three attorneys have all followed sort of continually of a pace their arguments have tracked distinctly what the need for continued academic diversity saying that we're not at the point where grutter's Ebola needs to be overruled that there is benefits to achieving racial diversity but essentially what's been countered by the very Adept arguments of the petitioner attorney is basically we can't put stock in essentially achieving diversity based on race alone when 30 to 40 other factors are taken into account if the Constitution is very clear about the prohibition of Reliance on race and the denial of equal protection one group over another why can't we simply eliminate race altogether particularly so because is here in the UNC case the expression of racial identity was itself voluntary Alito and Gorsuch actually went into a series of hypotheticals in which they discussed well where do we draw the line between national origin indigenous populations and race itself what if for example an individual emigrates from Afghanistan how do they identify themselves what I'm hearing repeatedly is that the more often race is used and the more finite these distinctions are attempted to be drawn that were problematic it becomes when a precedent begins to be exceptionally difficult to apply consistently as is the case here when we're dealing with constitutional issues and colleges aren't quite sure exactly how much race they can use the best approach and the constitutionally sound approach is to eliminate the use of that category altogether from what we witnessed in court Monday and past precedent do we have any sense of how the justices will rule a great question I am hearing deaf definitely based on lines of questioning the three liberal female justices voting together in a block with the Chief Justice very likely among them the line of questioning from Clarence Thomas who has driven exceptionally from a position of his own awareness of having gone to non-racially diverse schools and repeatedly emphasizing that the goal here is educational Excellence it's not racial diversity that is of course a secondary and ancillary goal it was recognized as a necessary result of the Civil Rights Movement but he himself never went to racially diverse schools I believe Clarence Thomas will probably vote with justices Alito Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and that leaves to my mind a single Swing Vote and possibly an unlikely one in Justice Amy Coney Barrett who's not quite sure based on her reasoning when the need for diversity comes to an end just how much diversity is required all right so this could come down to Barrett Sarah thanks for joining us that was Heritage Senior illegal fellow Sarah partial Perry coming up the U.S is facing a major diesel fuel shortage when you need Top Talent fast you need

need to hire you need indeed [Music] as winter approaches a looming diesel shortage and skyrocketing fuel costs have experts sounding the alarm over a potential energy crisis here with the latest on what's causing the shortage and what it means for your pocketbook is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips so Cabot what's going on with the energy Market well while gas prices have come down a bit from their all-time highs over the summer the rest of the energy sector is still experiencing sky-high prices the latest numbers from the labor department show that compared to this time last year propane is up 12 percent electricity is up 15 percent natural gas is up 33 percent and fuel oil is up 58 and those prices are only expected to go higher as winter comes and demand increases now what about diesel how significant is the shortage it is it's bad so last week the Energy Information Administration reported that American inventories are at their lowest point since 1951. and it's worth noting usually shortages like this occur coming out of winter instead of going into it now when most people think of diesel they only think of fuel used for big 18 wheelers but keep in mind diesel fuel is also used for are heating homes diesel prices have surged to 5.37 a gallon Nationwide this time last year it was 373. not only does that mean higher prices for heating but because diesel also fuels trucks that means the cost of shipping goes up which obviously then trickles down to the cost of goods for example Mansfield energy a large shipping company in Georgia wrote a letter last week to their clients saying quote conditions are rapidly devolving and carriers are having to visit multiple terminals to find Supply which delays deliveries and strains local trucking capacity now what's cause using the diesel shortage well there are a few things first America's fuel capacity is just lower than it's been in the past a number of large refineries were shut down over the last two years in large part as a result of new climate regulations from the bi-dministration as well as decreased demand during the pandemic and there's also the fact that the U.S has been shipping a significant portion of our fuel to Europe to help with their own shortages brought on in large part by the war in Ukraine and embargoes against Russia now it's not just a diesel shortage that we're seeing we're also seeing natural gas shortages in some parts of the country yeah you're absolutely right so while the diesel shortage is especially impacting the southeast the Northeast is preparing for a heating oil shortage currently New England's inventory of heating oil which is similar to diesel fuel are 70 percent lower than they've been on average across the last 30 years to give you an idea of where we stand eversource energy they're the largest utility company in all of New England just wrote a letter to President Biden asking him to prepare emergency measures saying quote New England will not have sufficient natural gas to meet power supply needs for the region in the event of a severe cold spell this winter and to that point we're already seeing suppliers in Massachusetts New York and Connecticut rationing the amount of heating oil that they're selling right now experts say it's part of an effort to prevent Panic buying or Hoarding in the short term the rationing is causing prices to rise even more heating oil is up 66 percent right now compared to this time last year so not good news across the board right definitely not the news we want to hear going into the winter Cabot thanks for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips to a former president Trump's legal battles have had significant updates in the past few days Trump's legal team has asked the Supreme Court for an emergency stay to protect his tax returns from congressional subpoena meanwhile in New York Trump's company is on trial for tax fraud and other charges here to discuss Trump's legal battles is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim let's start with the Congressional subpoena Trump hasn't had much luck in lower courts blocking that correct nope a judge he appointed has actually ruled against him now can we expect anything different from the Supreme Court well we'll see like you mentioned Trump's track record in this particular case hasn't been great as far as court rulings he may not need an outright win in the case though it may be enough to keep this case tied up in the courts long enough for Democrats to lose control of the house the Republican party is favored to win back the house in next week's election if it does you can expect Republicans to Snuff out this investigation next year okay so the DC Circuit Court ruled in August that the Congress could get Trump's tax returns what's Trump's case for keeping them protected sure Democrats in Congress are using a provision of the U.S tax code under it the chairman of the house Ways and Means Committee can get tax information from the treasury on anyone the chair wants Trump's team has said that the committee doesn't have a legitimate purpose for seeking his tax forms and the committee's request also raises separation of powers issues in any event the filing Trump's team made in court Monday doesn't ask for a ruling on those legal questions the filing just requests a temporary stay the legal arguments can be hashed out later if the stay is granted now let's pivot to the Trump organization trial jury selection wrapped up last week and opening arguments were held today what happened yeah first off this is a trial about Trump's family business neither Trump himself nor his children are facing charges the case focuses on two corporations specifically the Trump organization and the Trump payroll Corporation in the words of a Manhattan prosecutor this case is about greed and cheating the corporations are accused of cooking up tax evasion schemes and paying Executives under the table over a 15-year period starting in 2005. and what is the company's defense the company is trying to pin it all on Chief Financial Officer Alan weiselberg as Trump's legal team put it it started with Alan weisselberg and it ended with Alan weisselberg weisselberg accepted a plea deal with prosecutors in August he pleaded guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence in an agreement to testify against the company at trial weisselberg is at the center of many of the charges facing the company he pleaded guilty to receiving 1.7 million dollars worth of off the books compensation the illicit payments included a lease on two Mercedes and private school tuition for two of his grandchildren weisselberg's actions may seem ungrateful to the company he has worked five decades for but weisselberg is 75 and was facing up to 15 years in prison in addition to financial penalties with his deal he's expected to get a jail sentence of about five months and likely less with credit for good behavior so what's at stake for the Trump organization or Trump himself if the company loses the Trump organization faces a maximum fine of 1.6 million dollars it would also have more difficulty doing business in New York state as well as obtaining banking services such as loans Trump himself wouldn't face any direct legal consequences but he may face some political consequences if he decides to run for office again in 2024. all right well we're going to continue keeping track of this Tim thanks so much for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Tim Pierce foreign other

workers on Tuesday here to discuss the Court's ruling is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim let's start off with this decision's impact are these workers getting their jobs back yeah the petitioners will be for now at least the lawsuit was brought by over a dozen sanitation workers the judges order entitles those workers to be reinstated and given back pay the legal battle isn't over though unlike in other states the New York Supreme Court is not the highest court in the state according to the city it's already filed an appeal with the Appellate Division the city also says the vaccine mandate for public sector workers is still in place despite the ruling now the judge clearly found some major problems with the vaccine order what do you have to say there judge Ralph J porzio wrote a harsh critique of the vaccine mandate he said that legally speaking it qualified as arbitrary and capricious and accused the city of singling out public sector workers porzio also said the city's Commissioner of Health exceeded his authority and violated the state Constitution's separation of powers when did this mandate take effect the Mandate for public sector workers was instated in October 2021 by the city's Health Department a couple months later then Mayor Bill de Blasio followed the order up with a mandate covering private sector workers as well the Mandate sparked significant backlash one of the most notable protests came from pro basketball player Kyrie Irving Irving plays for the Brooklyn Nets and was forced to sit out home games because of his refusal to get vaccinated he was able to practice and play in Road games though in states without vaccine mandates yeah Irving's case made a lot of national headlines yeah it did New York city mayor Eric Adams decided to create car valves for the private sector vaccine mandate in March Adams Exempted professional athletes entertainers and others from the Mandate then in September he announced the city would scrap the private sector mandate altogether this put the choice in the hands of New York businesses that is imperative that we're asking them to continue to encourage their employees to get their vaccines and boost the shots our vaccinated Workforce kept the city open and operated over three hundred thousand employees it was crucial to put it in place and we're keeping that in place judge porzio said that the city was unfairly targeting public sector employees he wrote that either there is a mandate for all or there is a mandate for none he said that the city had authority to act initially because of the pandemic but eventually measures adopted unilaterally in crisis need to be ruled back or legislated into law if this ruling is upheld what happens then it opens the city up to litigation from all of the roughly 1700 city employees laid off because of the vaccine mandate presumably they'd all be entitled to the same damages received by the public sanitation workers who brought out the lawsuit so the city could be writing a bunch of checks here yep Tim thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Tim Pierce coming up a closer look at Michigan

poll from Michigan news source and Trafalgar has her tied at 48 percent with Governor Whitmer daily wire investigative reporter marade alordi is here with the details for us so morade Tudor Dixon is a political newcomer what's her background hi Georgia sure so Tudor Dixon is a mother of four and prior to launching her bid for governor she anchored a weekly political commentary show on real America's voice which is a right-leaning News Network since launching her bid she's had a pretty Swift Rise to the top of Michigan's GOP as you noted she got a big boost when five candidates including two front-runners did not qualify for the primary ballot according to Real Clear Politics polling averages incumbent Governor Gretchen Whitmer initially had a crushing 18-point lead but Dixon has been steadily gaining since the summer and now although Whitmer is still slightly ahead in some polls real clear politics is projecting the race will be a GOP pickup Trump endorsed Dixon in July and that endorsement was extremely important for her Maga style campaign Trump's endorsement came after former education secretary Betsy DeVos whose family is very powerful in Michigan GOP politics wrote a letter to the former president urging him to endorse Dixon and telling him that Dixon is quote the only one who can stand Toe to Toe with Whitmer devos's family supported Dixon financially giving at least four million dollars which was another factor that helped catapult her to the front of a crowded primary okay so Dixon has essentially run as an Unapologetic Maga Republican but Michigan is traditionally a blue to purple state so is that going to be a liability with Michigan voters maybe Dixon has previously said she believes Trump won the state of Michigan in 2020 even though the official count shows he lost in recent months though she's tried to distance herself from that stance pivoting more to criticizing irregularities and the way Michigan handled voting here's Dixon on Fox News when she was asked about the issue in July I've always focused on the way the election hat was handled and how we need to make sure it is secure in the future and that we don't have people looking back and saying we're questioning what actually happened she also weathered some controversy during her career as a political commentator on one occasion Dixon described hijabs as oppressive garments in 2020 she defended YouTuber Jenna Marbles after a 2011 video of marbles surfaced in which Marvels was dressed up in blackface impersonating singer Nicki Minaj Dixon stated that the Marvel's impersonation video was clearly intended as comedy some Outlets have also brought up the fact that Dixon endorsed a very conservative stance on abortion saying the health of the mother is the only appropriate exception however on the campaign Trail she's endorsed exceptions for rape and incest there's actually a ballot measure to enshrine the right to abortion in Michigan and Dixon has said she will respect that if it passes so it does seem like she's willing to compromise on the issue of abortion right well let's talk about her campaign platform what is she running on well Dixon is focused very heavily on culture issues as well as the economy she's spoken out against having biological males in girls Sports and she's also argued for getting race and gender ideology out of the classroom here's Dixon talking about the recent clashes between parents and schools it's very interesting in the state of Michigan parents are rising up and saying they want education back they want their students to have a chance they want to go back to the basics in education Reading Writing and math and they're fighting back against this woke agenda in our schools Dixon has also proposed policies to cut diversity equity and inclusion administrators from public schools and repurpose their salaries to pay for armed school security so overall Dixon is staunchly conservative on just about every issue perhaps even more so than other Republicans running elsewhere in the country well we'll have to see how Michigan voters feel about around November 8th marade thanks for reporting thanks Georgia that was daily wire investigative reporter maraid elordi [Music] in a stunning new poll nearly 60 percent of Americans who fear democracy is under threat say that the mainstream media is to blame Democrats have sought to make the alleged threat to democracy posed by Republicans a centerpiece of their midterm platform in this New York Times Siena poll found that 71 percent of respondents do believe that there is a threat to democracy but 80 percent of those say that the mainstream media is at least part of that threat here to break it down as columnist David Marcus hey Dave so do we know what's driving this good morning look to some degree it's coming from all sides and both parties of course for years now Donald Trump has called the news media the enemy of the people and fake news and on the left there are regular claims about the supposedly duplicitous nature of Fox News and other conservative Outlets uh there's not a ton of folks out there saying the media is doing great and clearly since it's a full 70 of Americans who say that democracy is under threat this isn't simply partisan both sides are very concerned about the future of the country and its government how did the mainstream media stack up against other threats included in the poll like politicians and institutions the media is in first I know maybe it's last place by a generous country mile 28 percent say Republicans are a major threat to democracy 33 say Democrats are federal government was 33 Supreme Court 27. that's the general range so the media is 59 is quite an outlier again you in these other examples you can make out some clear partisan differences not here it's often said that Americans can't agree on anything anymore but they're pretty close and they're disdain for and apparently actual fear of the media do we have a good sense of what people specifically view the threat posed by the media to be I assume they don't think a bunch of news anchors are going to start a coup so what is it look America Savvy news consumers and they know we're living in an information age if you can control the flow of information you can have enormous impact on a whole host of issues some believe that media suppression of the hunter Biden laptop story could have swung the election some believe that using viral videos of crime makes the problem seem much bigger than it is it really boils down to the Press being a vital part of a functioning democracy because if voters are poorly informed how can they arrive at good decisions right now this is a New York Times poll the times itself was in the news in recent days as former opinion page editor James Bennett spoke very candidly about being forced out of his position for running a column by Senator Tom Cotton that op-ed called for the use of the National Guard during the 2020 riots what did he say the state of the paper is he was remarkably harsh in fact and and said that by buckling to the Mob the paper of record quote blew the opportunity to make clear that the New York's times doesn't exist just to tell progressives how progressives should view reality end quote look I know from having written for Bennett at the times that he was committed to ideological diversity the paper just wouldn't allow it it's hard to overestimate how brutal this condemnation is he's basically calling it a biased newspaper and it mirrors things we've heard from other former time staffers like like Barry Weiss who called it a a hostile work environment and said that self-censorship has become the norm so there are a lot of people in the industry now waving a red flag and saying we have a big problem here another question in the poll that was intriguing asked whether respondents find Q Anon theories and ideas believable what did that one tell us right um Democrats have painted Q Anon as a kind of driving force behind the new right or conservative move movement this poll really shows the opposite a mere four percent believe this stuff 37 said they don't and 56 I didn't know enough to say uh one might say that the alleged prominence of this conspiratorial group in the GOP is itself just a conspiracy theory sounds about right thank you for joining us David thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus [Music] another story we're tracking this week a number of key midterm debates took place last night including the first and only debate between Pennsylvania Senate candidates John fetterman and Mehmet Oz the debate sparked renewed concerns over fetterman's Fitness for office here are a few of the notable moments I believe if my doctor believes that I'm fit to serve and and that's what I believe is appropriate and now with two weeks before the election you know I have run the campaign and I've been very transparent about being very open about the fact we're in use captioning and I believe that again my doctors the real doctors that I believe and they all believe that I'm ready to be served follow up I didn't hear you say you would release your full medical records why not you have 30 seconds now uh yeah again my Dr L believes that I'm fit to be serving and that's what I believe is where I'm standing fetterman also painted Oz as out of touch with middle and lower income voters and how can a man you know with with you know 10 gigantic Mansions you know has uh and willing to talk about a willing wage for anybody imagine a signal Mom trying with two children trying to race with him at one point he seemed to give a confusing answer about his stance on fracking Mr Oz I do want to clarify something you're saying tonight that you support fracking that you've always supported fracking but there is that 2018 interview that you said quote I don't support fracking at all so how do you square the two oh I I I do support fracking and I don't I don't I support fracking and I stand and I do support fracking thanks for listening to morning wire for more on the debates and their

already dissolved the corporate board and sent in Tesla Engineers to review the famously secret Twitter algorithm he also announced plans to cut 50 percent of the staff here to tell us what new policies musk is rolling out and what may come next is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan there's such a flurry of ever-shifting information surrounding the musk Twitter drama are there any hard developments that we can be sure of right now yeah you know and a lot of the conversation about Twitter does amount to little more than people trying to read musk's sometimes cryptic tweets like their tea leaves or something and we also know from experience that he likes to throw out ideas and gauge reactions that doesn't mean that he's going to implement them but what is clear clear is that his plans for monetization are going forward and to give you one example we know that he's going to revamp that verified blue check system so since 2009 Twitter has given blue checks to people who are public figures in some capacity authors actors media figures politicians people like that but over the years critics have complained that Twitter Gatekeepers tend to verify more users on the left than on the right and that gives the impression that left-wing views are more legitimate so what he plans to do now is have users pay for blue checks different numbers have been floated but this week he laid out an eight dollar a month plan and that will come with some other perks he said like boosting the user's content to reach more eyeballs and what kind of response is he getting for that well a lot of the current blue checks aren't fans uh give you one example horror novelist Stephen King said Twitter should pay him for being a blue check on the platform and if musk institutes the change he said he's i'll quote gone like Enron so a lot of Legacy Media users said they'll leave too but non-blue check folks seem to really like the idea but that's not musk's only proposal for making Twitter profitable something it has always struggled with he also proposed curating some news articles to let users bypass the outlets paywalls for a premium so sort of something like Apple news but some of the other ways that Twitter is reportedly looking at making money via paywalls are a lot more controversial so we've talked here in the past about a Twitter task force that was looking at the feasibility of monetizing pornography well musk is reportedly considering a new charge for some video content viewing now all ready about 13 percent of Twitter's content is pornography and it's one of the only social media sites that allows it so if users are enabled to put up paywalled videos that Twitter would take a cut of critics are saying that's going to lead to more porn on the platform even if that isn't the purpose of The Proposal now the whole purpose allegedly for musk buying Twitter was to protect free speech is there any indication of how he plans to do that well for those who are wondering if and when former president Donald Trump might be allowed back on the platform musk is now saying that that is not going to be anytime soon it'll be at least a few weeks once the company has established some clear processes for bringing back banned accounts so musk has said that he's forming a Content moderation and election Integrity Council that will include Representatives with widely Divergent views and he's also said he's talked to representatives from the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League that set off a lot of alarm bells for conservatives who say that these are the kind of left-wing groups that Twitter was already listening to but on the other hand this week we saw twice that Twitter fact check both President Biden and the official White House account so conservatives celebrated that move which they saw as something of a new approach for Twitter and musk replied quote the system is working okay so maybe warrant for some cautious optimism

the remarks echoed those that He gave in September in his fiery speech in Philadelphia came just six days before election day and less than a week after an attack on speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul in their San Francisco home here to discuss the political Fallout to the speech as columnist David Marcus so Dave we covered the speech yesterday but now we're starting to see the political response to it what was the president trying to achieve in this speech uh this was an interesting speech in many ways it was originally announced that it would be given at the Capitol but wound up taking place across the street at Union Station which allowed it to be a campaign not an official presidential speech but in style and substance it felt more like an official address for example there was notably no applause during his remarks this was no doubt meant to establish an era of solemnity and gravity he used the Pelosi attack as a hook at the beginning and then launched into his familiar line arguing that Republicans are a unique threat to democracy it wasn't as aggressive or shall we say dark and red as the Philly speech but was a pitch to voters that the future of democracy is on the ballot so you know ultimately it was a political speech intended to get out the vote for Democrat candidates now we noted yesterday the president's attempt to conflate the attack on Paul Pelosi by a man who was illegally in the country and who appears to be mentally unstable with the January 6 riots so that's one individual but did Biden offer any other names of specific threats no not not really once again he pointed to many Republican candidates across the country who Democrats claim our election deniers saying they're an estimated 300 but he didn't name names instead he hearkened back to January 6 which is probably why the speech was given so close to the capital and in one slight twist he called out mega mega Republicans which I guess is the new Ultra magnet if you're keeping track but um specifically called them a minority in the GOP but while also saying that they are the driving force not surprisingly the president did not mention Democrats like Stacey Abrams running for governor of Georgia or his own press secretary who have questioned election results in the past Biden also failed to mention specific instances of political motivated violence from the left as we saw with the failed assassination attempt on Brett Kavanaugh over the overturning of Roe v Wade and the attack on amarco Rubio campaign canvasser Biden made the point that a majority of Americans something on the order of 70 percent do think there's a threat to American democracy but you and I recently discussed the polling on that threat to democracy issue and it's more complicated than that right that's right uh Biden is correct about that 70 percent number but when you dig into it you see that about a third of the country sees Republicans as the threat but a third say it's Democrats as we've pointed out here a bipartisan majority sees the mainstream media as the biggest threat to democracy so this felt much more like a play to his base an attempt to juice turn out in a few vital House and Senate seats and the more relaxed tone was likely meant to avoid turning off independent voters who did not react particularly well uh to the heated rhetoric of his previous efforts right there's a lot of backlash to that speech so now the political response Republicans were quick to attack the speech not just on the merits or the question of threats to democracy but because it didn't mention inflation the economy crime or even abortion which are the issues voters say are most important to them was that a mistake from Biden I I guess that depends on whether he or the Democrats in general have anything to say about those issues especially the economy and crime that can help them win but he's given daytime campaign speeches where he's tried to talk up low unemployment and argue that the economy is fundamentally strong but that's just not what voters are seeing or saying is focusing on the somewhat esoteric quote threat to democracy unquote out of touch when people are struggling to buy groceries Republicans say yes but the president's other tactic telling them that everything's fine with the economy is maybe worse so picture poison I guess right this comes in the final days of the election when former Democrat presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have both been out on the trail are they actually eclipsing the sitting president and what's this National speech an attempt to Tamp that notion down a lot of Republicans are making just that point and it's no secret that many Democrat candidates have been avoiding by Ohio Senate candidate Tim Ryan who's locked in a battle with JD Vance has gone so far as to say Biden shouldn't run again meanwhile Obama and to a lesser extent Clinton are being sent to some of these Battleground States look Biden obviously doesn't want to be ignored and he has a lot of skin in this midterm if it's a big red wave calls for him not to run in 2024 will increase so maybe this speech was a Hail Mary pass worth throwing even though we know those rarely result in touchdowns right well Dave thanks for joining us and we'll see you on Election night if not sooner thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus [Music] a new report details the shocking conditions in LA's juvenile detention centers according to the report violent young inmates run the juvenile jails in Los Angeles Daily wire investigative reporter Murray delordy is here with the details for us so married what's going on in these jails hi Georgia so it looks like violence inside LA's juvenile jails is now out of control a new investigation by the Washington examiner took a look at how far things have spiraled prison guards at Los Angeles County Juvenile Hall live in fear for their lives as they try to keep killers carjackers and gang members in line according to the report one official said LA's juvenile Halls are quote on the verge of collapse That official believes someone is going to get killed at some point so how did this happen how'd the situation get to this point well part of the reason that these detention centers are so dangerous is that a juvenile has to be extremely violent to end up in one of these facilities so the population is the worst of the worst these are the most violent and behaviorally Disturbed juvenile offenders who have committed the worst crimes all locked up together meanwhile the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has banned jail guards from using things like pepper spray or tasers on inmates because they are juveniles because the guards don't have much leverage to discipline the inmates many have resorted to smuggling in drugs laptops and cell phones to ingratiate themselves with the inmates as a means of keeping the peace According to some probation officials officers regularly suffer serious injuries but get no support from LA County lawmakers most of whom are in favor of a softer Progressive approach for younger offenders keep in mind these inmates are often 18 or 19 year old kids and the guards are in their 40s or 50s on top of that already dangerous situation the board has also Frozen hiring which has caused caused a staff shortage at the jails how many juvenile offenders are actually in the jail at this point currently LA county has about 600 inmates in juvenile jails but just four years ago that number was three times as high in 2020 Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill closing California's four-state juvenile prisons which had about 750 inmates ages 15 to 25. most of them convicted of violent felonies like murder and robbery the idea behind closing the prisons was to house young offenders closer to their families and to focus on rehabilitating them but it also means that extremely violent offenders are kept in a lower security environment or released and another thing Newsome actually signed another bill that bans prosecutors from charging juveniles with another violent felony if they committed while jailed so these young offenders know that in many cases violence against guards or other inmates can't be prosecuted that's terrifying for everyone involved Murray thanks for reporting that was daily wire

effect in September this comes after several key aspects of the law were overruled by the courts Fulton County Sheriff Richard giardino told Fox News that the new law disproportionately targets law-abiding citizens with concealed carry licenses and that while he was not refusing to enforce the laws he and others would be using discretion in responding to cases stemming from the new restrictions on gun carrying here to discuss is columnist David Marcus hey Dave so what are these restrictions that the sheriffs are objecting to morning so this gun can the law provided a sweeping list of places in the state where even those allowed to carry firearms would not be permitted to churches stores public events most notably Times Square where small laminated signs have been posted announcing it as a gun-free zone to more than a few jokes the sheriffs really have two objections here one is that they feel people should be able to protect themselves in these spaces but also they don't want to divert their already scarce resources to focus on legal gun owners who are going about their day last week a federal judge blocked many of the provisions in this legislation saying that they violated the Constitution because they had no historical justification that's a standard established by Justice Clarence Thomas last year what aspects were blocked and why right so Justice Thomas's language says that gun control must be quote consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation unquote which includes allowing self-defense in most public spaces on this basis the judge allowed restrictions in polling places churches and schools but that's about it and most of the locations listed in the law like like public transportation that includes Subways those are sporting events and many others the judge said the right to carry could not be curtailed he also struck down a controversial element of the legislation that required gun purchasers to hand over three years of social media to this now New York's attorney general Leticia James has appealed the decision and asked the court to allow the law to stay in effect pending that appeal if that happens what are the sheriffs saying they'll do well again they're not saying refusal to enforce that they're saying discretion uh Giordano gave the example of not rushing to confront someone if there's a report they have a bulge in their pocket you know also cited the fact that that these kinds of new laws and restrictions with them there's a learning curve for the law abiding but the broader message is that this isn't what Law Enforcement wants or needs and the sheriff's complain that law enforcement was never asked what they do need by the legislature this comes before the backdrop of a governor's race which as you reported earlier this week has significantly tightened incumbent Kathy hokel says this is actually a tough on crime measure that will lower gun violence is that how it's playing with the voters it doesn't seem like it but yes uh this was passed through very quickly late this summer by democrats in response to Growing concern about crime across the state as well as a Supreme Court decision striking down the previous gun laws the problem is that this doesn't really address the kind of Street crime that New Yorkers are most worried about this was rather punctuated this weekend when a shooting took place outside the Long Island home of Lee zeldin the Republican candidate for governor I mean you really can't make it up and look certainly zeldin's gonna make some political hay of these sheriffs calling out a democrat-led state government Dave thanks for coming on thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus social media platform Twitter removed a post from Florida's Surgeon General last week that announced a new covet guidance recommending young men not get the vaccine due to cardiac risks the move is prompting new warnings about the power of big Tech to censor speech daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham is here to give us details on Florida's new guidance what data it was based on and how Twitter is responding so Megan big social media platforms suppressing certain medical opinions is nothing new but I just want to clarify in this case Florida Surgeon General Dr Joseph ladapo was not simply tweeting his opinion he was actually announcing Florida's new covid guidance policy is that correct yes that is correct and I know we have talked about big Tech tamping down on posts from dissenting doctors or other medical experts but in this case as you say Dr ladapo is a government official albeit at a state level and the post in question linked to the State's new guidance that recommended younger men aged 18 to 39 not get that covet vaccine due to an increased risk of myocarditis otherwise known as heart inflammation nation and his post also linked to analysis of data that the Florida Department of Health conducted to support their decision and that analysis found an 84 percent increase in cardiac related death for younger men within 28 days following vaccination okay so before we talk about what Twitter did I want to talk about that analysis because I know there's been some criticism of its methodology yeah there has for example some critics said that it wasn't clear the vaccine caused the myocarditis in that group it could have been some other Factor so I reached out to Dr Marty macari who is a surgical oncologist and professor of Health policy at Johns Hopkins to ask him specifically about that public health officials have said you can't make a correlation between this cardiac death and the vaccine without a formal study and they've chosen never to do those studies they've never funded those studies they don't release data to do those studies so Florida said we're going to do that study ourselves and they used a very elegant study design which was to say let's look at all heart attacks or cardiac deaths six months after coveted vaccination and let's ask ourselves or did they occur at an equal distribution over those six months or they clustered in the month after the vaccine and what they found is the latter they were clustered in the immediate four weeks after vaccination now I also saw some criticism that this analysis was not peer-reviewed yes that came up a lot and Makari addressed that too well peer review just means that as few as one or two other doctors any doctor in the United States has read the study and said this looks reasonable well now there are so many Publications that you can get anything published so many researchers have said given that peer review is not much more than the comments in the comment box after an article why don't we just go ahead and let the data speak for itself and that is essentially what Florida did and what's going on now that Twitter has restored ladapo's tweet and he's posted some additional information about the state's analysis since then okay and now I want to talk about that so Twitter took down the announcement what was their reasoning for that well the notification that replaced the post while it was being blocked said it was for violating Twitter's rules as far as what rule would apply Twitter's policy includes the right to take down tweets that contain misleading information related to covid-19 we've heard that a lot but they haven't offered any explanation beyond that and about a day and a half later after some pretty healthy public outcry you have to say that post was restored right well Megan thanks for reporting my pleasure that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham [Music] Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan and Republican J.D Vance faced off on the debate stage in Cleveland Ohio on Monday evening Ryan a 10-term congressman and Vance a popular author and political newcomer took part in the First of two debates scheduled in the race to be the next U.S senator for Ohio here to recap the debate is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim an actual debate between Senate candidates not many of those are happening these days what did we see in this first debate what really stuck out was the amount of direct attacks Ryan went after Vance's funding work in the private sector and even a non-profit Vance launched in 2017. vance attacked Ryan's two-decade career in the U.S house and his lack of experience in the private sector they both attempted to paint the other as extreme alright so let's start off with the issue that Americans care most about the economy what did the candidates say about inflation and other economic factors Vance blamed record high inflation on the Biden Administration and noted that Tim Ryan voted in lockstep with President Biden is simultaneously they've borrowed and spent trillions of dollars that we just don't have and that's thrown fuel on the flyer fire of the inflation problem problem and at the same time they've completely gone to war against America's energy sector and you can't do both of those things at the same time they're each bad ideas but when you do both of them at the same time you're going to get record inflation which is exactly what you expect to get Ryan for his part blamed inflation on supply chain issues and claimed that Vance and businessmen like him were the chief culprits JD Vance has invested into companies in China the problem we're having now with inflation is our supply chains all went to China and guys like him have made a lot of money off that and that is exactly why the supply chains are locked up as we've noted a few times since the overturning of Roe v Wade Democrats have campaigned very heavily on abortion what do the candidates say about that issue Ryan said he supported codifying the standard set out in Roe v Wade which guaranteed a right to an abortion but let States set time limits generally measured in weeks but as Vance pointed out Ryan voted this year for the Democrats reproductive Freedom Act which goes beyond Roe and would overturn many states abortion laws here's Ryan I support going back to Roe v Wade that was established law for 50 years and we didn't have all the chaos that we're having now one of the most notable moments came when Vance was asked about how his pro-life stance relates to the case of a ten-year-old Ohio girl who got an abortion out of state vancetti supports reasonable exceptions on abortion and blame the whole situation on Democrats immigration policies I have said repeatedly on the record that I think that that girl should be able to get an abortion if she and our family so choose to do so but let's talk about that case the thing they never mentioned is that poor girl was raped by an illegal alien somebody that should have never been in this state in the first place you voted so many times against border wall funding so many times for amnesty Tim if you had done your job she would have never been raped in the first place for his part Brian did address the border and acknowledged it's a real problem he also attempted to distance himself from vice president Kamala Harris who has insisted the border is secure Kamala Harris is absolutely wrong on that it's not secure we have a lot of work to do I'm not here to just get in a fight or just tow the Democratic party line I'm here to speak the truth Ryan and Vance were also asked about what they consider to be the greatest threat to democracy Ryan pointed to Republican extremists and tried to link Vance to a few high-profile names who who says that the president of the United States is intentionally trying to kill people with fentanyl who says that the election was stolen J.D Vance does who runs around with Ron DeSantis the governor of Florida who wants to ban books running around with Lindsey Graham who wants a National Abortion ban you're running around with Marjorie Taylor green who's the absolute looniest politician in America this is a dangerous group and we do need to confront it Vance on the other hand said that coordination between social media platforms and the federal government to shut down certain views and even major news stories is the biggest threat right now a very interesting debate Tim thanks for the rundown thanks for having me that was daily wires Tim Pierce tracking this week just Monmouth pole shows that

is upon us but this year things might look a little different thanks to one key factor inflation according to new data American consumers and companies are preparing to spend less and donate less than in years past here to discuss is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot will start with the consumer side of this today is Black Friday what changes are we expected to see this holiday season well it'll hardly be a surprise at this point but virtually everything is going to be more expensive this holiday season we talked recently about Thanksgiving meals being more expensive but it goes well beyond that flights are 40 more expensive this year than last and gas while down relative to this Summer's Peak is still about 10 percent higher than last Thanksgiving a CNN put it quote get ready for the most expensive holiday travel season ever and those price increases mean Americans simply have less to spend on other things like gifts and charity yeah tell us about that what do we expect with consumer spending so according to a recent survey by Deloitte consult thing Americans plan on buying an average of nine gifts this holiday season that is down considerably from 16 gifts in the same survey last year we saw another report from ship station that predicted a 30 billion dollar drop in holiday gift spending this year compared to last with the biggest drops expected in clothing and Footwear and keep in mind we've already seen consumer spending going in the wrong direction for months it did jump eight percent last year but has seen less than two percent growth every month this year and because most Americans are strapped for cash these days retailers know they've got to offer big sales to try and entice customers but that is tough when businesses are also feeling the pinch all right so what are retailers doing to try and compensate for that well first retailers have tried their best to move customers toward online shopping as opposed to in person that helps them offset the cost of Labor which is important given how tight the labor market is right now that also explains why many so-called Black Friday deals have been going on for weeks now companies are really trying to spread things out to their advantage another thing you're going to see more of this holiday season as consumers grapple with higher prices are buy now pay later installment plans offered by retailers now these might help offset sticker shock on higher priced Goods in the short term but long term can be dangerous as they often hurt your credit score and include incredibly High fees for missed payments yeah Dave Ramsey now we're also expecting to see a decrease in charitable donations this year what's the latest on that yeah this party is really concerning as well so not only do many businesses rely on the holiday season to reach end of your fiscal goals but a lot of Charities are in the same boat about a third of all donations take place between Thanksgiving and Christmas but this year Charities are bracing for a drop in giving as donations are often the first thing cut from a budget when things get tighter on that note we've seen more than a 10 drop in the number of Americans giving to charity this year compared to last and the biggest drop not surprisingly comes among those giving less than 500 a year now it's important to note the United States is Far and Away the most terrible Nation on Earth last year for example Americans gave away nearly half a trillion dollars so even with the dip this year we're still leading the world in charitable giving but definitely a concerning Trend that's clearly being driven by the poor state of the economy all right so inflation is clearly the key factor here but what else is causing this downturn yeah there's no question inflation is the number one factor it's not rocket science people just have less money to spend but beyond inflation consumer sentiment is also a really important factor in all this right now Americans are more pessimistic about the state of the economy and their own personal finances than at any time since the 0809 recession and that means that even if some Americans do have enough money to afford gifts or donations now if they feel like they won't be in a good spot a year from now they still are likely to hold off and that's really driving a lot of this yeah that makes sense could things change as we approach Christmas well there's always the chance that projections end up being wrong and to that point there are some economists and companies with a more Rosy Outlook they say that people might give one answer in a survey but often end up acting differently in reality both Walmart and MasterCard to that point have projected healthy holiday spending this year and there's also the fact that Supply chains aren't quite as backed up as they've been in past meeting inventory is higher than last year so some reason for optimism but the general fundamentals of the economy still in a very negative spot right now well let's hope for some surprisingly good news Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's the daily wire senior editor Kevin Phillips [Music] Ticketmaster has

and this is of course supporting her new album the errors the entire Fiasco just led to calls for the so-called Ticketmaster Monopoly to be broken up and you can't blame fans now according to Ticketmaster though more than 3.5 million people pre-registered to buy those Swift tickets huge demand they expected it was even worse than they imagine now they said that bot attacks also factored in here as well so given all that attention the Bots the system broke down that means fans faced really bad technical glitches along the way some of them are getting booted off the site and other ones just had to wait hours and hours to get those tickets and has Taylor Swift actually addressed this issue she has you know Taylor Swift has a huge social media following so she went to social media and shared with us and she said listen I'm really sorry and I feel terribly about this she described what fans went through as like like being through with several bear attacks pretty clever and it really does connect with a common fan now regarding the criticisms of Ticketmaster this isn't the first high profile incident we've seen that's prompted calls for it to be broken up tell us about the Springsteen incident this past summer yeah I don't think a lot of artists love Ticketmaster it's kind of a necessary evil as they see it but just in July Bruce Springsteen's fans were outraged by the platform's fees now just to put in perspective fans are being charged thousands of dollars for even mid-range seats not the best of the best not the front row and this was all due to Ticketmaster's Dynamic pricing model now again fans don't mind paying big bucks for big seats but these prices and I felt like extortion to them now according to Vox report the average ticket fee is about 27 of the overall face value of a ticket and in some cases it's as high as 37 percent in that case the fans just were angry at the boss Bruce Springsteen now he's long been this blue-collar hero his songs touching those themes over and again it's his brand and fans thought the prices were being kind of hypocritical and really conflicting with that image of him now has Bruce Springsteen actually addressed any of this he didn't right away at first it was just Springsteen's manager at John Landau who came to his client's defense now he said well yes some of the tickets do cost a thousand dollars or more the true average ticket price in his words were in the mid 200 range which he said was a fair price especially when you're talking about Springsteen I mean he's regarded across the culture as one of the greatest artists of his generation and I don't think that's a that's hyperbole at all no Springsteen himself stayed mom on the subject for a while months and months and then recently he spoke to Rolling Stone magazine the conversation came to those tour price tickets and all the controversy and he defended the prices he said they were totally affordable and he also said that Ticketmaster should be able to sell some tickets at higher rates so we're now again hearing calls for Ticketmaster to be broken up for example congresswoman Alexandria ocasio-cortez tweeted something to that effect over the past few days is that something we could actually see it's only possible it'd be kind of interesting to see this had some bipartisan support we'll have to kind of remain to see how that plays out but you know she called Ticketmaster a monopoly pretty pretty harsh words but some may agree with that and the U.S justice department has opened up an Anti-Trust investigation into Ticketmaster they've been reaching out to different companies different venues saying hey according to the New York Times is this an abuse of power in this concert space but of course music lovers may have to wait a while if they want any lower prices or even just a little bit of what they see as Justice these Anti-Trust battles even the ones that are successful they often take years and years to play out all right well Christian thanks so much for reporting thank you that was daily wire contributor Christian Toto [Music] many factors contribute to how friendly a state is for business a new report details the business climates for each state and where they ranked based on tax policy here to bring us more information is daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond all right Charlotte some intriguing numbers here tell us about this report sure so the tax Foundation released its 2023 State business tax climate index last month and through the findings we can see which states have the best and worst tax landscapes for businesses next year he might not be surprised to hear which states had the worst taxes New Jersey came in 50th place with New York California Connecticut Maryland and Minnesota coming in above it so all pretty deep blue states there the best states were Wyoming at number one then South Dakota Alaska Florida Montana and New Hampshire unsurprisingly mostly red States in that list what exactly contributes to a state being considered so burdensome for Texas a few factors so the report said that states that ranked the lowest had a few things in common essentially High rates paired with complicated tax policies New Jersey which again was the worst state came in 48th for individual and corporate taxes 42nd for sales taxes and 45th for property taxes it has some of the steepest property taxes of any state as well as the highest corporate income taxes and one of the steepest rate individual income taxes now one of the main reasons a state lands in the top ten is when it doesn't have a major tax every state has property and unemployment insurance taxes but some don't have one or more of the other huge taxes like the individual income tax the corporate income tax or the sales tax some examples of that are Nevada Wyoming and South Dakota they don't have any individual or corporate income tax but Nevada does tax companies on gross sales Alaska has no individual income tax or sales tax at the state level Florida doesn't have an individual income tax in New Hampshire and Montana don't have a sales tax it's not entirely clear-cut though as the report points out Indiana and Utah do have all of the major taxes but they're still in the top 10 states on the report now I noticed Texas which has no income tax is off the top 10 list there why is that yeah Janelle Fritz a policy Analyst at the tax Foundation told me that even though Texas doesn't have an individual income tax it has high sales taxes and high property tax Collections and while it doesn't have a traditional corporate income tax the way it targets businesses gross receipts is actually worse got it some other interesting points Arizona moved up in its ranking this year it changed from four income tax brackets to two and in 2023 a 2.5 percent tax rate will start which is lower than it has been and will help it move up in the rankings next year Washington State moved down on the list a full 13 places it used to not have an income tax but now it started a capital gains income tax on people who make a lot of money but the tax isn't adjusted for inflation and has a marriage penalty Janelle Fritz again from the tax Foundation she told me that states can improve their rankings by prioritizing pro-growth tax policies and they shouldn't just try to get rid of a specific tax only since that can sometimes lead to undesirable trade-offs what are some other factors that residents should take into account when it comes to taxes in their state well an interesting thing that might come into play is the tax on student debt forgiveness on this but others might tax the forgiven loans as someone's income CNBC also ranks states to see which are the best this year for business and also Incorporated how States use certain competitiveness markers to promote business in their state North Carolina came in first followed by Washington and Virginia with Mississippi coming in last followed by Alaska and Louisiana the site used other measurements such as the Life Health and inclusion in the state it's business friendliness education and cost of living but lots of factors certainly can be important for companies as they either attract people to live there or don't as we're seeing with people moving out of California to other states where they would rather work and live yeah it makes sense a lot of factors to consider there Charlotte thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond

hundred dollars for spreading misinformation causing a storm of backlash this weekend and forcing the company to quickly pull the policy and issue a statement here to tell us more about the policy and how PayPal is explaining it is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan a Payment Processing Company finding its customers for speech it disapproves of is pretty shocking on its face is that really what the new policy entailed hey John um well to put it bluntly yes the new terms band sending posting or publishing any of what PayPal is calling messages content or materials that promote misinformation now it didn't Define What specifically constitutes misinformation but if PayPal felt that a user had violated the policy it could find them at twenty five hundred dollars and that was set to take effect on November 3rd now their user policy already had some speech prohibitions forbidding hate and tolerance and discrimination but this new updated policy expanded that to specifically Address speech directed at what they're calling protected groups and that would include gender identity and sexual orientation so in that case it would be unclear how say Christian users who might Express religious convictions would be treated if PayPal felt they were in violation of that policy so what's the reaction been to this obviously controversial policy well not too surprising it's been pretty overwhelmingly negative a lot of conservatives as you might expect have criticized the company Tennessee's Republican senator Marsha Blackburn for instance commented quoting here PayPal is censoring speech if you don't listen they will steal your money we cannot allow this to happen but a lot of people who aren't associated with the right also spoke out against it one of PayPal's Founders David Marcus no relation to our daily wire contributor well he tweeted Saturday it's hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to PayPal's new AUP goes against everything I believe in a private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with and Elon Musk replied that he agreed with that by the way and Marcus wasn't the only one connected to PayPal out slamming the company Blake Masters who is a republican candidate for Senate in air Arizona has been famously backed by PayPal founder Peter Thiel and here's what he told Fox News on Sunday rights we need to ban companies at that level at that size especially if they're touching banking or if they're in social media we're going to ban these companies from discriminating against users because of the political content of their speech that's how we treat the phone company right so the issue of big business becoming politicized was already a major issue energizing Republicans going into the midterm elections this PayPal story is likely to only increase that voter enthusiasm but PayPal has issued a statement and says this was a result of an error is this a reversal well they aren't calling it a reversal they're saying that it was a misunderstanding and they are not finding people for misinformation the company put out a statement saying that the notice that included information about that fine went out by mistake and it said it's working to correct the policy pages and apologize for any confusion but so far it hasn't offered explanation for how or why this twenty five hundred dollar fine was ever proposed in the first place or how it got inserted into the acceptable use policy and they haven't said if they're only ditching the misinformation fine or if that new discriminatory speech standard is also going to be withdrawn all right so some major questions still to be answered what has the impact of all this attention been on PayPal well as you might imagine it hasn't been good people all over social media were posting images showing that they'd close their accounts and PayPal's stock price and immediately dropped more than five percent Monday morning which was an underperformance compared to the rest of the tech Market it does seem like a startling new development in the financial sector have we seen any similar penalizing policies like this I don't think we've seen anything this Broad in the U.S but I wouldn't call it unprecedented to give you one example GoFundMe notoriously froze millions of dollars in donations from the freedom Convoy truckers in Canada and in fact the Canadian government even froze some of the truckers bank accounts so there is that well I think a lot of us are going to be taking a little closer look at the terms of service before we click that agree box thanks for the story Megan that was daily wire cultural reporter Megan Basham Carey lake is vying to be the next governor of Arizona but she's not without controversy the longtime TV news anchor is well known for her Charisma and hard-line stance on illegal immigration but she's also stirred up debate with her rhetoric around voter fraud here to give us the background on this Arizona fire brand is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim I'm seeing articles about Carrie Lake everywhere just yesterday the Atlantic referred to her as trumpism's new leading lady tell us about her background hey Georgia Carrie Lake grew up in rural Iowa the youngest of nine children she studied journalism at the University of Iowa before moving on to work at news stations in Iowa and New York before settling in Arizona she joined the team at Fox 10 as a weekend anchor and stayed there for 22 years she left the station in early 2021 announcing her retirement in a video posted to the media platform Rumble in March that year the video now has close to 2 million views here's a snippet of what that sounded like sadly journalism has changed a lot since I first stepped into a newsroom and I'll be honest I don't like the direction it's going the media needs more balance in coverage and a wider range of viewpoints represented in every Newsroom at every level and in each position now what is her political background Lake does have a mixed political past she was reportedly a member of the GOP up until 2006 at which time she registered as an independent two years after that she registered as a Democrat and supported then Senator Barack Obama in his first presidential run but according to her colleagues Lake became more engaged with conservative politics around 2015 when former president Trump first announced his run for office she was an early Trump supporter and by most accounts a genuine one his slogan about fake news resonated with her experience as a news anchor she also liked that he was a political Outsider who rejected political correctness so voters will have to decide whether they buy her authenticity on that right so she resigned from local news in March of 2021 how did she transition into politics yeah three months after dropping a retirement video she announced her run for governor due to her name recognition she had a pretty substantial head start on the campaign Trail her main platform from the start was a Hardline stance on immigration and skepticism about the fairness of the 2020 election in Arizona she branded herself early on as the Maga candidate and got Trump's early backing pretty quickly now you hinted at this before but what are her key issues immigration and election Integrity are two big issues Lake's immigration plan is one of the most aggressive in the country she wants to declare an invasion and use the National Guard to arrest and Deport migrants caught crossing the southern border illegally I spoke with Lake recently about our immigration plan here's what she had to say I I don't want to send illegal immigrants and illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard in Chicago it's fun to watch you know them complain about 50 illegal aliens well we're dealing with hundreds of thousands if not Millions we want to stop them at the border which is my right to do as a governor now the elephant in the room and something that a lot of these Publications have been seizing on is Cary Lake openly questioned the 2020 election in Arizona yeah here she is in January at a rally with former president Trump election was rotten to the Core we all know it right you know that right the media knows it knows it and they're trying to make us just accept it and we will not accept that you don't steal our vote when I am Governor we will drag that back out into the sunlight and we will close every single Loop hope that allows them to cheat we're not going to let them cheat anymore so she really goes all in on her positions right she's confident which is part of her appeal to voters most recently she made some headlines for trying to force her opponent Katie Hopps to debate Katie I'm speaking directly to you you claim to care about the people of Arizona prove it debate me you name the time and you name the place I will allow you to choose the moderator hell I'll even let you write the questions ask me anything Hobbs is so far refused here's her explaining why I heard of of the spectacular create because that doesn't do any service to the voters of Arizona to hear from us where we stand on the issues and how we would govern well Kerry lake has been running a wild west style campaign right now the race looks like it's neck and neck we're just gonna have to wait and see what Arizona voters think Tim thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wire reporter Tim Pierce [Music] Los Angeles is battling both a crime wave and a police shortage but the city is struggling to recruit new cops due to the High Cost of Living local angelinos are now pooling their own money to offer new cops thousands of dollars in rent subsidies to work in their City Daily wire investigative reporter Merida Lordi is here with the details for us so marade tell us about this rent subsidy program hi Georgia so this program is called housing for hires new LAPD hires can get huge rent subsidies of up to twenty four thousand dollars over two years for housing in Los Angeles and this money is not coming out of the LAPD budget it's coming from private donations to the LAPD Foundation new LAPD officers usually get a starting salary of about eighty thousand dollars so a twenty four thousand rent subsidy is a significant boost that should help with the high cost of living in La according to one analysis the Los Angeles metropolitan area now has a median rent of over twenty two hundred dollars up from less than Nineteen Hundred fifty dollars in 2019 that's a jump of nearly 16 percent now how significant is the police shortage in LA right now well in August police chief Michael Moore said the force was down about 176 officers the total police force in La is over nine thousand more concerning though the chief said the number of applications coming in has gotten smaller in real terms the this has resulted in slower response times across the city meanwhile violent crime is up significantly as of the end of July homicides in LA county had risen 30 percent since 2020 to more than 200 homicides so far this year shooting victims are up 43 since 2020 to nearly 800 victims as we've reported before shoplifting has also become a huge issue police say a big driver of the crime spike is La district attorney George gascon's policies which tend to favor being lenient on criminals including violent repeat offenders well it's not just La I understand California is now competing with other states for police officers right even within the state there's Fierce competition for officers for example Reading California which is north of San Francisco is offering forty thousand dollars signing bonuses for new officers so that gives you an idea of how desperate they are but other states are vying for officers as well Ithaca New York is offering twenty thousand dollar signing bonuses Seattle is offering thirty thousand dollars for experienced officers so the big question now is whether these generous perks are going to be enough to offset the frustrations and the dangers of working as a cop in LA right well we'll continue to follow this marade thanks so much for reporting thanks Georgia that was daily wire investigative reporter mauraid elordi another story we're tracking this week North Korean officials say recent

    "0GHr844okKE": "[Music] the housing market is slowing at the fastest rate on record but does that mean it will be easier to buy not necessarily we break down what's driving the drop in home prices I'm Georgia Howe with daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley it's Thursday October 27th and this is morning wire the UK has named their third prime minister in three months I know the high office I

interest rates new data shows that the once red hot housing market is now slowing down faster than at any point on record and it's about to get worse here with more on what's driving prices down and what it means for homeowners and renters is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips okay but we've talked about the market cooling off but things are really hitting a new level now they absolutely are last month existing home sales fell by 24 marking the eighth straight month of decline we haven't seen a slide last that long since 2007. the number of listings also fell last month by 22 percent and mortgage applications are down 38 percent this year compared to last they now sit at their lowest point in a quarter century and also 22 percent of homes for sale had a price drop last month that's another record but perhaps most concerning of all in the month of August that's the last month we have data for home prices fell nearly three percent compared to the month before now that might not sound like much but we have not seen a 30-day drop that drastic since we started tracking this stat all the way back in 1987 and it's worth pointing out that record was also broken again last month as well so long story short home prices are decelerating faster than at any point in modern history how much of this housing slowdown is a result of the FED raising rates that is certainly the main reason so in an effort to curb inflation and slow down the economy the FED is continuing to raise interest rates they're now up around seven percent that's a 20-year high and that means that if you've had your eye on a house since the summer and you saw a fifty thousand dollar price cut it's actually probably more expensive for you to buy that house now than it was then yeah because your monthly mortgage payment is going to be so much higher with these new rate hikes and that reality is causing the pool of home buyers to shrink which is terrible timing because there's about to be a huge spike in new homes coming onto the market yeah tell us about the timing Factor here with all the building so during the pandemic we saw construction on new homes crater but then after lockdown's ended Builders had to deal with massive supply chain backups which prevented them from capitalizing on the increased demand post covet so as the market continued to heat up last year those Builders really race to fill the demand and started construction on a record number of new homes so last month there were 800 000 new homes under construction but the problem is that the market itself is completely different now than it was when construction started meaning the price of those new homes is going to be way less than Builders had anticipated to that point here's Jeremy Siegel professor of Finance at upenn's Wharton School talking about the price drops that we're expecting to see on houses moving forward I think we're going to have the second biggest housing price decline of post-world War II period over the next 12 months um and I mean that's a very very significant uh factor for for for wealth for equity and the housing market but it's not just the housing market that's seen major changes lately right yeah well the average price of a new home has plummeted this year the price of rent has skyrocketed over the last two years rent has gone up 25 nationally and that Spike has now driven and a lot of renters just completely out of the market last quarter for example apartment demand hit its lowest point since 2009 and as a result many Young Americans are either moving back in with their parents or even moving in with friends because they can't afford anywhere else the latest figures show that 18 of American adults said that they'd lived rent-free with friends or family in the last six months 18 18 that is the highest number since that data was first collected back in 2015. and just from a social standpoint it's also worth noting we've talked on the show about America's declining birth rate and population decline while study after study shows that people are less likely to get married and have kids when they're living with their parents or feel like they can't afford a home yeah there's another factor that could impact society as the economy continues to worsen Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's the daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips coming up Britain

week vowing to steady the economy at a time of political chaos in the country prime minister Rishi sunak acknowledged the mistakes of his predecessor Liz truss but said he'll make economic stability and confidence the Cornerstone of his administration noting that that would mean quote difficult decisions to come here to discuss the situation is daily wire senior editor as short so Ash this is the third prime minister since July what's going on in the UK right it's been a pretty hectic few months in the United Kingdom Boris Johnson resigned in July amid multiple scandals and his foreign secretary Liz trust then took over but she lasted just 44 days and now we have sooner now what happened with Liz Truss was appointed just weeks before the gas prices in Europe went haywire which can't really be blamed on her since they had more to do with covid's supply chain issues Ukraine and pre-existing issues with the European energy Market but truss's attempt to deal with them caused a lot of Fallout in September she designed a mini budget which included a cap on Energy prices with the difference to be paid by the government through borrowing at the same time though trust's Administration cut a bunch of taxes for example they suspended the UK's carbon tax scrapped a planned rise in corporation taxes and lowered income taxes so essentially trust ballooned the country's debt at a terrible time which sent the markets into a nosedive and tanked the British pound also around this time the bank of England announced there's a liquidity crisis in Pension funds that was just hours away from blowing up so they had to raise interest rates dramatically and begin buying back their own bonds so it was a huge mess there's a worthy debate to be had about whether trust's policies could have possibly been beneficial in the longer term but the media was pretty brutal to her and she clearly wasn't prepared to stand by her plan so she resigned within a few days Britain's conservative party selected sunac to replace her okay so now they have sunac he's obviously walking into a really difficult situation what is he saying he's going to do well it's not entirely clear right now how his policy approach will differ from Liz trusses because he appears to be putting together the same cabinet as both Boris Johnson and trust but it looks like his first priority is reassuring the British people that they're in good hands here's a clip from his first speech as prime minister I will unite our country not with words but with action I will work day in and day out to deliver for you this government will have integrity professionalism and accountability at every level Trust is earned and I will earn yours part of building that trust will involve having the UK's office of budget responsibility review his economic package which trust's Administration did not do as well as allowing the bank of England to raise interest rates if they find it necessary sunec is also expected to slash spending something that will likely be met with pushback in a country with a long-standing tradition of big government which some people argue contributed to the mess they're in now now trust was famously pro-brexit where does sunac fall on that well he has publicly supported brexit in the past but he isn't necessarily a nationalist some critics are raising Flags about his association with the world economic Forum his father-in-law is Tech billionaire nariana Murphy who owns the Indian tech company Infosys Infosys is an official partner of the wef and has been linked to the social credit score movement so for people who are concerned about the social credit system being furthered on a global scale this is potentially a concerning conflict of interest absolutely that's something we're going to keep an eye on ash thanks so much for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Ash short a new study shows that some states far outpace others in voter and Civic engagement here to give us the details on the study is daily wire's Charlotte Pence Bond so Charlotte let's start with the basics who did this study and what did they find the study was published by a personal finance group called wallet Hub it looked at all 50 states with a focus on 10 main points of evidence having to do with political participation for example the portion of people who were registered to vote in 2020's presidential race as well as the amount of political donations now which state or States came in first in participation the top state was Maryland followed by a New Jersey Virginia Washington Oregon Minnesota California Arizona New York and Iowa the lowest participation state was Arkansas followed by West Virginia Alabama South Dakota Nebraska South Carolina Oklahoma Indiana Louisiana and Idaho coming in right above it interesting pattern there so there's a political lean to it right and as you mentioned at the top blue states are much more politically engaged than red States on balance which is a little unexpected you'd think purple States would have the most motivation to vote but that's just not really the case and it doesn't seem to correlate with median income either for example during the 2018 midterms the lowest voter turnout was Arkansas followed by Hawaii and West Virginia now keep in mind by some measures Hawaii is the most affluent State whereas Arkansas and West Virginia are much lower that same year the voter turnout was highest in Maine so do rates of Civic engagement give either party an advantage well the study didn't parse out the data by party affiliation so it's not clear that blue voters are engaging at higher rates than red voters all we know is that voters in blue states are more engaged but it does have implications for things like the national popular vote if blue states are more engaged overall now do we have any information about voter enthusiasm along partisan lines for this upcoming election our recent morning console Politico survey showed that excitement among Democratic voters is about even with Republicans 59 of democrat voters said they were extremely or very enthusiastic about voting in the midterms and 58 of Republicans said the same but Democratic party insiders have been voicing concern about the perception that Democrat enthusiasm is low here's former mayor of Atlanta Keisha Lance bottoms discussing just that just as a voter I can tell you I am very concerned that the lack of enthusiasm in our state right now and I know that oftentimes in midterm elections people don't turn out to vote I hope that won't be the case uh this year in Georgia analysts at wallethub named Jill Gonzalez told me they're hoping to see more people vote this cycle due to the current economic situation but we just won't know until November now did this study offer any insights about why blue states have higher rates of participation than red States well Jill Gonzalez says blue states have more voter accessibility policies and more volunteer political campaign opportunities per capita but that doesn't really answer the fundamental question of why people seem to show more interest in politics in blue states in the first place it's possible that these policies and organizations successfully reach disengaged voters who might otherwise not vote so basically the policies turn disengaged voters into engaged voters all right well Charlotte thanks so much for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond another story we're tracking

editor-in-chief John Bickley it's Thursday November 24th and this is your Thanksgiving edition of morning wire [Music] hey there producer Colton here do you like to be the first to know about trending

break it all down download The Daily wire Plus app and keep up with the facts no matter where your day takes you for this special Thanksgiving episode I sit down with the director and creator of chosen Dallas Jenkins to discuss how his team managed to create the hit series its unique funding structure with Angel Studios and why it's become such a massive success on various streaming platforms well Dallas thanks for coming on and congratulations on the success of the chosen including now in theaters first tell us about what you guys are doing that's different than everyone else in the entertainment sphere particularly in terms of how you produce the series well I don't know how I mean what you guys are doing is pretty different too and it's this concept of not relying on the traditional system which I don't hate and I mean I love movies I love TV shows I love a lot of the streaming platforms but the traditional platforms and the traditional system doesn't work for everybody and it oftentimes doesn't help you on the front end sometimes you're knocking on the door and the door is locked in my case the door was locked because my movie had failed I had a movie come out in theaters in 2017 and it was a bomb at the box office and then I had a story idea idea for a show about the Life of Christ and most of the rooms in which you would knock on the door are not really interested in doing a Jesus show so between a failure that I was coming off of and the subject matter that I wanted to talk about and that a show I wanted to make there were people lining around the block for me so what we did was we launched the chosen as a crowdfunded opportunity meaning my short film I may made this short film about the birth of Christ from the perspective of the Shepherds for my church's Christmas Eve service that's all it was intended for but while I was making it I had this idea I mean I shot this on my friend's Farm 20 minutes from my house we put that out on social media and at the end of it I said look if you want to invest we had an opportunity for a a public crowdfunding investment opportunity and so I didn't think it was going to work it was an idea from a distribution partner that I thought was ridiculous but the concept was people watch this short film hear about my idea of the show and then they can invest not just not a donation this was actually an investment and I thought well the all-time crowdfunding record is over 5 million dollars from projects that had big fan bases we have no fan base well very long story short we ended up generating over 10 million dollars from 19 000 people around the world investing in this thing and that's what launched season one and uh since then because the show is free so you don't have to sign up you don't have to give an email address you don't have to do anything you don't have to pay anything to watch the show we also made it in our own app so you know you watch it on the chosen app it's totally free and easy this is not we're not beholden to another platform that has really given us the freedom to do what we want which is something you guys understand of course but people have the have the option to to donate to it if they so choose and that's been something that I think has really allowed this show to reach the Mass Appeal that it has and now we're we've we've crossed 100 million viewers around the world we're in every country now that whole thing has just happened I think because of the fact that we've been doing things different you use the term invest rather than donate in the early stages what do you mean by that well this was literally an investment the 16 000 plus the number I think is 16 000 actually plus people who invested early on they have an ownership in the show so as the show is generating income and potentially profits over the course of several years my co-founders and I we own one part of the business and the other half as I think it's somewhere around 45 percent of the business is owned by these sixteen thousand investors so when the show succeeds they succeed and we uh we were just able to actually announce recently that they got their money back plus twenty percent so we actually delivered on that initial promise and then from now until the end of time uh they still have ownership in the show so if there's ever distributions from profits of this show they share with us in that and so it's a really cool opportunity and the the their investment I mean again I have to be careful with what I say publicly but their investment uh has already returned plus profit and it's looking extremely good for the future so it's just a really cool part of the show which is that it's very much a community now you provide access to the chosen for free so how do you monetize something like this this is often where those kinds of projects fail how do you monetize something like the chosen right so people have the opportunity if they want to donate to the show now we've partnered with this uh organization that was founded it's called the come and see Foundation it was founded for the purpose of expanding the show around the world this an outside person came in and said listen we want this show to get everywhere we want to translate it into hundreds of languages we want it to reach places that you can't reach we want to we want to jump start these efforts your budgets are lower we want to get them higher because we want the show to have every opportunity to succeed so we give people the opportunity to donate to that foundation and that money goes towards production funds marketing funds all of that that's the non-profit side now the for-profit side has come from merchandise sales which we were doing early on that has been significant and then also commercial licensing so for example if there's another platform that after it's been in our app for a period of time wants to license it I mean season one has been on Amazon has been on Netflix it's been on multiple platforms and that has generated some income as well so that's where the for-profit side comes from and the nonprofit side comes from this and we have people I'm not saying anything that's not public because you can see the progress in our app but we have people donating in excess of millions of dollars I mean people can donate everything from 15 bucks to I mean they can donate whatever they want and that opportunity that people have has been a supercharge to to the show so took a little time to figure that out but we ultimately realized free was better that when we made it free the show expanded and when people watch the show free they wanted to be part of it and they wanted to see it happen it strikes me that a lot of this is very counter-intuitive particularly for the Hollywood model one of the criticisms leveled at Hollywood a lot is that there's so much waste and so much money thrown at projects really unnecessarily how are you guys managing to be more efficient with your funds yeah well we have no choice I mean that's what's so interesting about what you're saying it's a really good question because most platforms Network Studios or whatever when they launch a new show well the first couple Seasons there's no way it's going to be profitable it's very expensive to put on a new show you don't know if it's going to find an audience yet so you're putting money in that you don't know if it's going to pay off in most shows I don't know if I want to say most but a lot of shows don't ever make money because they don't have enough Seasons to get the big syndication dollars that can come or a lot of times movies just don't don't succeed so all of that is very very challenging well what they have going for them is they can take those risks because they've got so much money elsewhere coming from all the other shows that they've made in movies that they've made so they can pump all that money into it and spend tens of millions of dollars to launch it well we don't have that opportunity or luxury I mean the only money that we have is money that comes in from the fans for this particular show so that's made it difficult but to your point about efficiency I think it's also made us smarter you know every dollar we spend we consider it to be sacred money and we don't have the ability to nor the desire to just put money towards fluff that said the good news is is that now that we have more money coming in we are able to pay our cast and crew closer to what they deserve now we'll never reach full Hollywood budgets but the fact that we can pay people better than they were the first couple Seasons when we were completely independent uh that's been for sure a great Advantage but yeah we have to we have no choice we have to be efficient we have to be smart we have to be wise and we don't have money coming in from other projects that we can just toss at this to see how it works well it strikes me that soon Hollywood won't be able to pay Hollywood prices for some of these actors one thing you alluded to is that the success of this kind of project and this kind of business model really depends upon the confidence of the investors and the donors how do you maintain that is it transparency well that's a that's a really great question because trust goes in two different directions one is there's artistic trust and then there's also spiritual trust meaning they need to trust that actually the show is going to honor and be faithful to the stories of Jesus and the gospels and that's a big deal so what we have done is from the beginning transparency like you said has been kind of the Hallmark of it I mean not only are we a public company we're a publicly reporting company but on our social media Pages we just decided from the beginning you're going to see this whole process I'm going to take you behind the scenes of myself my family the struggle to make this show we're going to take you on to the set so on our YouTube Pages or Instagram page Twitter Tick Tock Facebook all of that you get to see in real time often the progress of this show and what they see is a couple things one they see that we're spending the money wisely and that we're actually a professional show that's doing this right they also get to know us better which makes them feel more connected and so if you're going to support a show like this or if you're going to watch even watch a show like some people are afraid to watch a Jesus show if they don't feel like they can trust it so they feel like they know us better and then finally though what's very important is that they do believe that I have the character and intentions of Jesus in the gospels in in good hands that I am actually being faithful to that now with all the artistic imagination that we're adding to these stories from the Bible That's especially important people do not want to put money towards or even their time towards something that they feel is going to be typically contradictory to the message of Christ and so that's been a big deal for us and and so I feel like from the beginning we've said look they can trust me they're going to then be more willing to invest literally and figuratively into the show and that's been the case so what's next for the Chosen and for your other projects what are we seeing on the horizon here well right now I'm really focused on the chosen I mean other projects are in development but uh you know it's it's a it's a big enough task for me especially as the creator of the show and I don't have to make the show I have to market the show I have to keep it keep the audience engaged I'm I'm now what they call an influencer you know we used an influencer model for this project so that's a full-time job but you know season three out now um you know the the first couple episodes are out and available the first two seasons are available on the chosen app and you know you just look it up it's easy to find but here's the point um I I right now I am editing the rest of season three while writing season four because we're going to start filming in the spring the train really never stops and so other projects that now people want to make with me that the show is more successful um it you know those are certainly in development but I I really don't want to take my hand off the plow of this project either because if this doesn't work then a lot of other things won't work so we've got projects in development but for now uh right now I just need to get I need to get season four going and when we're done with the seven season to The Chosen all napped for about a year and then we'll start working on other things now stepping back and looking at this big picture the response to the chosen which has been overwhelming what do you think the lesson is here in terms of audience demand what are they starving for what are they missing well there's a and you know this as well as anybody I mean the fact is Hollywood is largely dominated by groups of people who don't necessarily have the same values or the same background or faith interest as certain parts of the country that's not their fault and they have every right to make the products uh and and content that they understand that they know that reflects their background the stories that they want to tell but what this shows is there there is a large part of the country and a large part of the world in fact Christians are represent the biggest or if not one of the biggest people groups in the entire world people who believe in Christ they want this kind of content and they don't get it and what's cool about this though the chosen is that this has also been appealing to people who don't fit into that category it's just so what I think it speaks to is I think if you're a Christian this is certainly something that says hey look someone is making a show that reflects my values My Love Of Christ and it's done in a way that can compete artistically with everything else that's out there I don't need to apologize for watching it I don't need to put deploy my nose to enjoy it I can actually enjoy this and that's that's proving that this group of people around the world that number in the billions deserve good entertainment as well the other thing it shows is that I think even just the message of Christ even if you don't believe that he was the son of God even if you don't believe that he was the Messiah you can still appreciate the stories of first century Galilee and what happened there that certainly changed the world and so just like I can watch a show like you know Game of Thrones or a movie like Star Wars and not believe in the the force or not believe in in dragons I can still appreciate good storytelling and I think that's what people are at least I hope are responding to with this show well Dallas thank you so much for joining us that was chosen Creator Dallas Jenkins and

    "hyI4UI1nO40": "[Music] a CDC panel has voted to add coveted vaccinations to a federal children's immunization program great people are concerned that this is uh enthusiasm that's not supported by clinical data what will the move mean for kids and will it impact requirements for public schools I'm Georgia Howe with daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley it's Thursday October 20th and this is morning wire the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee is demanding that the doj and FBI come clean about what he says is voluminous evidence of Biden family criminal conduct I think

CDC Advisory panel voted Wednesday to add coveted vaccinations to a federal children's immunization program some medical experts say it could be a major step toward requiring coveted vaccinations for School attendance daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham joins us now to discuss what the vote was about and what it might mean for school immunization requirements so Megan to start what exactly is the CDC voting on this week because I've seen some reports claiming that they're deciding whether to add coveted vaccines to the list of things that kids need to get before they go to school is that correct no it's not not yet anyway so the question that the CDC took up was whether to add covid vaccines to the vaccines for children's program and what that is is a federally funded program that provides vaccinations to kids whose families may not be able to afford them so they voted unanimously to do that and now what that will do is attach a stronger level of recommendation than simply advising parents to get their children vaccinated for covid I spoke to Dr Marty McCary of Johns Hopkins just before the vote here's what he told me that's what's got people concerned because it could be a slippery slope and lead to a broad statement that every kid must get this vaccine now if they decide to go down that path the coveted vaccine in children would be the first ever vaccine on the child immunization schedule that's not supported by solid evidence in the literature that reduces disease in the community so the vote on the immunization schedule question that is whether the covid vaccine might be added to that list of school required immunizations will happen later on Thursday but this vote suggests that they're likely to approve that now I've heard from a lot of parents who are alarmed about adding the coveted vaccination to the schedule for a variety of reasons they cite the relatively low risk that covid poses to healthy kids as well as the lack of data about some potential complications associated with the vaccine did Dr McCary have any opinion on that yes he certainly did he is adamantly against the idea of requiring children to get the vaccine and he says that those concerns about things like myocarditis are very much legitimate but he also says that getting the covid vaccine can be the right choice for vulnerable children those who are dealing with underlying issues like say leukemia or morbid obesity the problem he feels is that too little information about the vaccine has been provided to the medical Community the little data that exists from Human trials has not been made public instead the companies released a press release simply saying the vaccine was great and that it works I asked him why he believes we don't have that data and his answer was pretty blunt they've not given any reason but generally speaking many of us believe that it's because the data are not favorable McCary also points out that at this point most children have likely had covid yet there's been no serious discussion about natural antibodies from a previous infection now I know we've had Dr McCary on before and he's expressed a lot of concern about how something like this could affect public trust in vaccine protocols in general which could become a major problem yes very much and in fact so much that I'm just going to let him speak for himself on that we have been building public trust for things like the polio vaccine and the MMR vaccine which saved lives for 50 years and we're going to see a reversal of public trust that we have built for 50 years if they decide to go ahead and add the coveted vaccine to the immunization schedule so we'll find out what the CDC decides on Thursday but this week's vote could give us a pretty big clue about their trajectory and in the meantime we're seeing different states taking different approaches California for example has a pending mandate for K-12 students Mississippi and Florida on the other hand have banned requiring covet vaccination to attend school well this is definitely something we're going to keep gathering information about for parents Megan thanks so much for reporting yeah my pleasure that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham coming up we speak to Congressman Jim Jordan about New FBI whistleblower claims and an economy as volatile as this one it's important to have

wire Chuck Grassley the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter this week to the doj and FBI demanding that they come clean to Congress and the American people with respect to the steps that have been taken or failed to take relating to the hunter Biden investigation joining us to discuss is Congressman Jim Jordan ranking Republican on the house Judiciary Committee so Congressman let's Jump Right In Here Senator grassley's letter this week to A.G Garland and FBI director Ray cites significant evidence from whistleblowers concerning criminal conduct by Hunter and James Biden what do we know here you know we've had multiple whistleblowers talk to Senator grassley's uh office multiple Wilson lawyers come talk to us about just the overall political nature of the justice department and we know that two years ago this month that the uh FBI was involved in based on what was have told us was involved in suppressing the hunter Biden story just weeks before the most important election we had and I would also add this too we know about the suspicious activity reports reported 150 of them um that the treasury Department has on some of the Biden uh business operations so all that just underscores how important it was to do the proper investigation proper oversight if in fact uh the American people put Republicans in the majority here in 20 days from the reports you've seen and the information you have how long has there been an alleged effort to cover this up well you know well um I think it goes back to two years ago this month I mean we know that's over 51 former Intel officials who sign a letter um that the letter says that the hunter Biden laptops during the whole situation had quote all the earmarks of Russian disinformation when in fact it wasn't um stream press uh social media they also pressed the story and kept it from the American people you know frankly we're going to change the outcome of the election based on on polling recent polling that's been done well if people would have known about what was going on there so um I want to know where did these 51 Intel officials what did they base that on was someone at the FBI telling them that information did I communicate to that to them about that was that the reason they all signed this letter which again became the reason that you saw this story suppressed and we know based on what uh Mark Zuckerberg said in a recent podcast that the FBI talked to Facebook and told them to be on the lookout wink wink of Russian disinformation so I think that's an important element sometimes we get to the jury that we need to uh to get to the bottom of now as a ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee what action can be taken on this issue if you gain the majority you know the executive branch handles the any type of prosecution but we do have an obligation under the Constitution to get the facts and the true to the American people we have now a justice department whether it's suppressing information regarding the hunter Biden story whether it's um you know the number of whistleblers have come and told us about the focus on making every case a domestic violent extremism case or whether it's that the action that the justice department in cahoots with the left-wing political organization the national school boards Association when they work together to go after moms and dads and chill to speak to parents showing up at school board meetings on and on it goes and frankly justice department that is treating pro-lifer is much different and then it choose the attacks on churches and crisis pregnancy centers nothing comparable to what they're doing to pro-life activists all that needs to be looked at and we plan on doing just that Congressman thank you so much for joining us thanks guys so Cliff that was Congressman Jim Jordan [Music] with midterm elections nearly Upon Us morning wires spoke with a republican candidate looking to flip a reliably blue seat and become the youngest female member of Congress in history here with more on Caroline Levitt the Republican nominee for New Hampshire's first congressional district is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips so Cabot you've been following this race for a little while what can you tell us well it's easy to focus entirely on the Senate and Governor's races but keep in mind if you're a republican wanting to push back on the Biden agenda you've really got to start by taking the house now there are plenty of races to follow there but this one in particular is really grabbing headlines as the 25 year old Levitt has now pulled within one point of democrat incumbent Chris Pappas that is surprising not only because this is a district that's been reliably blue the last few Cycles but also because Levitt was not even expected to get out of the primary in the first place right so tell us about the opposition she faced in the GOP Primary so Levitt was definitely not the first pick among GOP leadership in Washington and that led to a grueling primary outside groups spent over a million dollars on ads attacking her and GOP minority leader Kevin McCarthy poured 1.3 million dollars into her opponent's campaign clearly viewing him as having a better chance of winning in the general now it's worth noting that opponent Matt mowers had also been the nominee in 2020 and lost and was also a more senior member of the Trump Administration but as Levitt told us despite a fundraising disadvantage to mowers a lot of her success can be attributed to what she calls the high energy Grassroots campaign we knocked over 70 000 doors I'm at a different event in a different town every single night and I hear directly from voters inflation is at the top of their minds this winter literally people are going to have to choose between Heating and eating in our state home heating oil has never been more expensive it's costing people hundreds thousands of dollars to heat their homes because of this administration's policies so Lovett is a Grassroots candidate sort of an underdog and it sounds like that's resonating with people what's her platform front and center is the economy and more specifically taxes keep in mind she's running in New Hampshire which is well known for maintaining much lower tax rates than neighboring states as a result for decades now Massachusetts residents have been moving to New Hampshire for the cheaper cost of living and Levitt says a lot of New Hampshire natives are worried about maintaining a pro-business environment as the makeup of the state is changing on social issues she's very vocal about supporting the police up to and including vowing to protect qualified immunity for officers which has been very controversial even on the right she's also called for increased border security and a zero tolerance policy for illegal immigration and States on our website that she is pro-life but does stop short of promising to a fight abortion on the federal level now historically Republicans have been successful in the Northeast when they run on fiscal issues but pull back on social issues is that the template that Levitt's using yes and no she's definitely more of a Maga Republican certainly more than you would typically see from most Republican candidates in New England who tend to be more moderate but the exception there does seem to be abortion where she's appeared to sort of soften her message I've been very clear on where I stand on Hampshire made their voice clear when we passed the law in last year's legislative session in the new budget signed by Governor Krista Nunu I won't do anything in Congress to override that lob well definitely a race to watch cat but thanks for reporting anytime

a newly updated index on military strength joining us to discuss is former Marine lieutenant colonel Dakota wood a Heritage Senior fellow and editor of the index of military strength Dakota thanks so much for joining us and thanks for your service now first off what is the index of military strength think of it as a report card on how your military did in the preceding year so you get to the end of the school year you get your grades so it's a kind of a retrospective of how that year unfolded but it does you know show indicators you know strong or weak in history math what have you so the index basically scores the military services and says how do they do this year are they training enough do they have modern equipment or broken down stuff do they have enough in terms of capacity and so we compile all that throughout the year publish this index and it's a report to the American people now you recently put out the 2023 results of this index what did you find uh the military is weak so on a scale of very weak week uh kind of a moderate level called marginal strong and very strong those five grades and and it's not an indictment of the quality of the people we have fantastic people working in the military services that work long hours to do great stuff but they're using really old equipment the military continues to shrink and we just don't have the Readiness you know Pilots aren't flying in the cold war with the Soviet Union was around an Air Force pilot would fly in excess of 300 hours a year today the average pilot in the Air Force is flying fewer than 120 they're getting maybe one fight of about an hour and a half or so each week you just can't maintain your skills now in dollars has there been a drastic reduction in funding or is it just an expanded need uh it's both of those things and they're not in contradiction with each other so in this past budget year you saw an increase of about four percent in defense spending but if inflation is running at eight or nine percent you're still losing ground right so again it's just been a paucity of funding that has been spent well but you still have the end result of of service that is too old too small and less ready and meanwhile we see things like Russia invading Ukraine and the posturing of China with respect to Taiwan and you just can't ignore that now what about military culture we've seen some stories this year about the proliferation of things like Dei training in the military which some people have blamed for deteriorating culture and cohesiveness do your metrics capture changes like that if my competitor my enemy is looking at our military they have to believe that we not only have the ability to go to war but we're so good at combat operations that we would actually win that deters my competitor from doing that if there's a belief that the United States military is distracted well then where is the deterrence value right so it's inherently damaging to the country's military posture now how do we measure up to other world powers for example China uh it's very concerning if we have the 292 ships about 60 of those on average are in the Western Pacific region you know that area near China China's Navy is 360 ships so China talking about Sirius again seriously been investing in their military they're producing uh state-of-the-art equipment they're watching what the United States has done over the last 20 years they're taking lessons from Russia's war against Ukraine and and they're really proving themselves to have some some meaningful capability and it causes us to be concerned about whether or not our military would be able to aggregate you know to to descend on that particular region if need be and actually perform as expected giving all these factors that we've been discussing so what's the solution here what should Congress or the administration do to address this so part of this really is money money to train to fly to shoot to replace you know broken pieces of gear and so that's part of it on the military side they really have to make a compelling argument you know how much do we need of what type of stuff to go up against a range of competitors it costs 16 times accounting for inflation 16 times as much to outfit a U.S soldier today because the body armor and Optics and goggles and weapons and first aid kits and all the things than it did to outfit that same Soldier during the Vietnam war so the spending has just not kept pace with that all right well thank you so much for coming on to discuss this today a real pleasure

Battleground State here are the latest numbers from the all-important state of Arizona is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot will start with the senate race this one's really tightened over the last month where do things stand now we're looking at a dead heat our new poll found Republican Blake Masters trailing Democrat incumbent Mark Kelly 47.4 to 46.4 that is within the margin of error making this race a statistical tie now we've seen other polls throughout late September and early October that showed Masters really closing in but this is the first poll that's been released in the last week and obviously it shows things closer than ever how has Masters been able to close the gap on Kelly well we've talked plenty about how Republican candidates are benefiting at the polls from the poor state of the economy including that latest inflation report but Masters is also finding a lot of success on immigration pointing out that Kelly has routinely voted lockstep with Biden's agenda and saying it's made the Border crisis worse and you can tell it's really hurting Democrats by the way that the Democrat Kelly has shifted his stance on immigration he now opposes Biden's decision to end title 42 and has started calling for a billion dollars in funding for increased security at the border so that's a major issue to watch over the next few weeks but certainly an about phase four the Democrat Kelly it certainly is I want to shift gears to the other part of this poll which looked at the governor's race between Republican Kerry Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs what do we find there our poll has Carrie Lake in the lead 49-46 that is about in line with what we've seen from the last two polls out of Arizona which both also have Lake up by three so after a few Rocky weeks on the campaign Trail for the Democrat Hobbs we talked about the backlash over her refusal to appear in the debate it definitely seems like she's falling behind now typically Governor's races don't get as much national attention but this one is getting a lot of attention from people outside the state who are really hoping that Lake's clear popularity in the state will help other Republican candidates on the ballot especially Masters who originally was viewed as more of a long shot against the incumbent Kelly but is really gaining ground now okay so Lake ahead by about three what else really jumped out from this poll so one thing that caught my attention is the performance of Masters in Lake among minority voters we've talked plenty on the show about the Republican gains with latino voters and again we saw that in this poll 44 supported Masters and 45 percent of Latinos supported Lake and also among black voters Lake was at 39 and Masters at 36 percent that's well above where Republicans have been in past elections so if those numbers hold on Election Day or really even if Republicans get close to those numbers on election day it's going to be very difficult for Democrats to win in the state and more importantly it could serve as even more confirmation that Republicans are starting to peel off a sizable chunk of a once reliable Democrat voting block yeah certainly could Kevin thanks for joining us anytime that's daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips for those wanting more on the midterms tune in to this Sunday's election wire show we'll talk with Trafalgar polling founder Robert kahali and get you all the latest from other Battleground races the video version of the show is available on YouTube and the audio is available on the morning wire feed [Music] a landmark trial that began in Arkansas this week will consider whether states can ban medical gender transitions for children the K stems from Arkansas's law Banning gender surgery and hormone treatments for minors daily wire investigative reporter Murray delordy is here with the details for us so Murray tell us about this trial hi Georgia so this trial began Monday at the federal appeals court in Little Rock Arkansas judge J Moody who temporarily blocked the ban last year is presiding over the trial which is expected to last for at least a week the state is arguing to keep the ban and claims that doctors prescribe hormone treatments to children without an adequate assessment of the child and without making sure families are aware of the risks the families of four transgender kids along with two doctors are trying to kill the law saying their children won't be able to get the medical care they need if it remains now what does this gender treatment ban actually do what are the details of the law sure so Arkansas's law is called the save adolescence from experimentation act it bans gender surgery puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatments for minors so anyone under 18. it also bans doctors from referring kids to another doctor to get their surgery or prescriptions doctors who violate the law could lose their medical licenses or be sued Arkansas attorney general Leslie Rutledge says the ban is about protecting children and points out that adults can still get gender treatments like cross-ex hormones and gender surgery under the law here's Arkansas state representative Robin lundstrom who says children shouldn't be making life-altering decisions much like in Arkansas you can't have alcohol or smoke cigarettes or have a tattoo rent property drive a car because under 18 you don't have the ability of making a lot of really solid decisions now will this ruling affect laws in other states so yes the outcome of this case could affect laws in Texas and Alabama which have also been blocked in Alabama a similar law Banning puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for children was blocked the Alabama Law actually made it a felony carrying up to 10 years in prison for a doctor to prescribe these hormone treatments to kids in Texas a judge blocked the state from initiating child abuse investigations into parents who are allowing their children to get medical gender treatments more than a dozen states are considering similar laws this trial also comes at a time when parents are really taking notice of the risks that come with a child medically transitioning and we're also seeing more young people speaking out about regretting their medical gender transition so what are these specific medical risks that doctors are worried about well both puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones come with serious health risks including infertility and weight gain puberty blockers can affect bone growth and density and cross-ex hormones can cause blood clots diabetes Strokes heart problems high blood pressure and male pattern baldness as well as increase the risk of breast cancer if hormones are started before the completion of puberty the child's genital development is stunted which prevents them from experiencing sexual function even as an adult and obviously gender surgery is irreversible so Arkansas's ban wants to prevent miners from making that irreversible decision some very serious considerations then Murray thanks for reporting thanks Georgia that was daily wire investigative reporter Murray delordy another

putting up strong numbers in many of the Battleground races joining us to discuss is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips so Cabot this election did not go the way many had projected including us and many of the polls we presented ended up missing the mark let's start with the Senate what did the numbers look like at this point well keep in mind a good number of the races still have not been called most experts had originally predicted anywhere from 51 to 54 seats for Republicans when all was said and done but at this point Republicans will be thrilled if they just get 251 seats and even that might be a stretch as we talk right now it's fast approaching 2 A.M eastern time so our listeners will have a few more results than we've got right now but it looks like Republicans are going to be happy if they even end up with a tie in the Senate when the night started they had success in a few states with North Carolina Republican Ted Bud beating out a surprisingly strong showing from Democrat Sherry Beasley especially early on and then in Ohio Republican JD Vance had a solid victory over Democrat Challenger Tim Ryan throwing Marco Rubio who we'll get to in a second down in Florida he won pretty easily as well and Republicans were feeling good at the start of the night right but then the night started to shift yes it did in Pennsylvania the race we've talked about quite a bit Democrat John fetterman jumped out to an early against Republican Dr Oz and he held on to it though the race did narrow considerably In The End by 2 A.M this morning he was up about two points with 91 reporting and a number of outlets had projected him to be the winner we also saw a disappointing showing in the state of New Hampshire a lot of polls had Republican Don bolduck with the lead or at least within the margin of error but it ended up not being all that close as Democrat incumbent Maggie Hassan was declared the winner after jumping to a double-digit lead with 75 percent of votes in what's a reason for optimism today for the GOP yeah the easy answer there is the state of Florida for years it's been considered a swing state but that is clearly no longer the case Republicans had overwhelming success at every level across the State of Florida Senator Marco Rubio who touched on earlier outperformed expectations and cruised to an early victory over Democrat Val demings but the story of the night was governor Ron DeSantis who at last count was up 20 points on Democrat Charlie Crist for context he won Florida by just 30 000 votes back in 2018 he won by over 1.5 million votes yesterday all right let's get to the house now what are we looking out there well most experts and every polling model out there had Republicans all but guaranteed to take the house with potentially even 30 or 40 seats gained again a number of those races still have not been called so we don't know the final numbers but most projections seem to indicate that Republicans will maybe scrape by with a majority but it's going to be close and and even that looks like a battle right now so where did Republicans gain ground looking state by state Republicans had again a solid showing in Florida where they picked up at least four seats they also picked up a seat in Georgia a few in Michigan and a seat in Texas and New Jersey as well now for the Democrats part they did manage to flip several seats in the state of California at least one in Illinois as well as one in North Carolina and Ohio now we've highlighted before some of the conservative Latinas running as Republicans in Texas how did they fare yeah again it was a mixed bag here as well so Myra floret so we talked about a good bit on the show we actually spoke to her a few times personally she had won that special election earlier in 2021 in a heavily Latino District she ended up losing to Democrat Vincente Gonzalez who was also an incumbent because of redistricting during 2020. Cassie Garcia also lost to border Hawk Democrat Henry Cuellar those were both considered tough races for the GOP heading in but obviously disappointing for them nonetheless but a republican Monica De La Cruz did come out on top winning the 15th District in Texas so we had an election that rather than being a clear Red Wave was almost a stalemate in both the House and Senate not would anyone including us were expecting based on the history of midterms and all of the momentum for the GOP not at all John so that's where Congress stands now until more results are finalized that brings us to the governor's races and will keep Cabot on for the next segment to break down those key contests while grocery store meat prices continue to rise good ranchers is dedicated to helping you save as

goodranchers.com wire goodranchers American Meat delivered continuing now with our post-election coverages Cabot Phillips all right Cabot you mentioned that race with Governor DeSantis there was a total of 36 Governors races six of which were tightly contested what do we know so far about the results of those races so there were very few flips and the ones we did see were not all that surprising for example Democrat Maura Healy picked up the governorship in Massachusetts likewise Democrat Wes Moore won in Maryland replacing outgoing Republican Larry Hogan in both of those cases Democrats replaced moderate Republicans who were retiring an otherwise deep blue State all right so we discussed DeSantis and his 20-point victory over Charlie Crist what were some other contests that we saw that Republicans really over performed or surpassed expectations well a first-tier point on DeSantis many are really crediting him today with turning a purple State into a solid red State probably the most significant aspect of that race is that Miami-Dade County went red for the first time in 20 years that it really speaks to the realignment that's underway way in Florida and it's largely propelled by Latino voters moving on now to other incumbents that had strong showings in Texas governor Greg Abbott handily defeated Challenger Beto O'Rourke by more than 12 points and then down in Georgia Brian Kemp also was able to defeat Stacey Abrams for the second time however Republican candidates did fail to clinch a couple potential pickup opportunities so in Michigan despite closing the distance in recent polls incumbent Governor gretson Whitmer the Democrat did end up beating Republican Challenger Tudor Dixon and then in New York the governor's race that everyone was talking about towards the end polls were all over the place Alex Richard fogger had it essentially a toss-up others had hokel with a eight or nine or even double-digit lead but in the end it ended up being about in the middle of those two scenarios as Kathy hokel ended up defeating lizelden by about five points in what was a surprisingly close contest All Things Considered so what's going to happen is that over the course of uh these next couple of hours you're going to see the race continue to get closer and closer and closer and closer so like the House and Senate this is obviously a letdown for Republicans who had been encouraged by recent polls what happened overall in this election cycle well it's going to be a while until we know exactly what went wrong it's definitely worth noting though that virtually every polling Outlet did show major momentum for republicans and even Outlets that were typically more friendly to Democrats had projected that they would lose the house and likely the Senate the prevailing Theory right now for how all those polls were so off in the end is that polls this go around might have ended up exaggerating Republican support because they were trying to you know compensate for being off in favor of Democrats across the last three Cycles but again it's early we haven't had a true postmortem yet but that does seem to be the prevailing narrative right now well Kevin we really appreciate all the work you've put into this and all your work last night and this morning we'll continue to track these races and these outcomes that are still not decided a lot more to get to that was daily wires Cabot Phillips foreign reminder that we have incompetent people running the show in Arizona that was Kerry Lake Tuesday night after vote tabulation machines experienced widespread malfunctions yesterday in Maricopa County the most populous County in Arizona this led Republicans to file an emergency motion to extend voting hours daily wire culture reporter and Native Arizona and Megan Basham joins us now to explain what happened in the Grand Canyon State so Megan there were a lot of conflicting reports early on in the day yesterday about what was going on in the polling places rumors flying around on social media what was the problem well Arizona voters began reporting that the vote tabulating machines were spitting out their ballots there were different estimations about how many polling places were affected chairman to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Bill Gates claimed it was 20 percent but a lawsuit Republicans filed in the evening to keep polls open later claimed it was 36 percent this was what one Maricopa voter said he experienced I went into vote filled out my form went through the to the machine rejected it they have you flip it over upside down put it in four different ways went through again and did did the same thing I actually tried it three times on four different sides on two different machines it would not count it I was not the only one that's having this issue some people were going through with spoil ballots just like me uh the poll uh worker at the machine said this has been happening all morning technicians later determined that the issue was that printers weren't producing enough dark marks on the ballots but by that time some voters said they were being told that they would have to find another polling place to vote this was Gates addressing the issue midday yesterday you never know what's going to happen in election no one here at Maricopa County has ever claimed that there is such a thing as a perfect election now Gates went on to say that voters could place their ballots in a secured box that would later be counted after those ballots were transported to a central location later in the night but there were wide reports that some voters didn't feel comfortable doing that so as you might imagine that led to some pretty sharp criticism from Republicans Texas Senator Ted Cruz for example asked so the Dem nominee for governor who refused to debate her opponent is the current Secretary of State in charge of running this election and now there are problems so what about the lawsuit what are they saying right so the campaigns for gubernatorial candidate Carrie Lake and Senate candidate Blake Masters along with the RNC petitioned to keep the polls open an additional three hours until 10 pm what they argued was that hiccups decreased voters opportunity to cast ballots they also asked that the court mandate that no early ballot results be announced until an hour after that at 11 PM essentially what the Republicans were arguing was that some voters at the polling places where machines were malfunctioning were told they could go vote at a different location but once they got to the second polling place these voters were then told that they could not vote because they had already checked in at that first precinct now a state judge denied the Republicans request but not because of the merits of their argument rather he said that they hadn't offered hard evidence that voters were unable to vote and he agreed with election officials that since the request came only a few minutes before the polls were scheduled to close at seven o'clock that just wasn't going to be enough time to implement the change now it's important to note the context that about 60 percent of the population of Arizona lives in Maricopa County and it will still be some time before we know the outcome of races in Arizona correct yeah that is correct because of these printer issues Arizona election officials are saying we aren't going to have the results until at least Friday and I'll go out on a limb and say we may not have heard the last about these ballot issues now Arizona joins a list of states that are going to have to continue to wait Megan thanks for reporting yeah anytime that's daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham well

time address former president Donald Trump announced his bid for re-election to the White House in 2024 after teasing the decision for over a year were the latest on what the former president had to say and how it could alter the political landscape is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot obviously it's a big deal when a former president announces their running again this is particularly a big deal what can you tell us yeah it is historic to say the least so throughout history just one president Grover Cleveland has successfully won re-election after being voted out but one thing it's not though is surprising even before the 2020 election Trump said quote we're trying to do another four years otherwise I'll see you in four years clearly implying that he'd run again if he lost and now we've got confirmation that he is from his property at Mar-A-Lago Trump described why he's running once again under our leadership we were a great and glorious Nation something you haven't heard for quite a long period of time we're a strong nation and importantly we were a free Nation but now we are a nation in Decline we are a failing Nation for millions of Americans the past two years under Joe Biden have been a time of pain hardship anxiety and despair Trump went on to lay out his vision for 2024 as well we will win because we will fight to lift up the working men and working women of America and to restore the fabric of this nation the radical left Democrats have embraced an extreme ideology of government domination and control our approach is the opposite one based on freedom values individual responsibility and just plain common sense it's common sense we will dismantle the Deep State and restore government by the people to further drain the swamp I will push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress we will do whatever it takes to bring back honesty confidence and Trust in our elections to eliminate cheating I will immediately demand voter ID same-day voting and only paper ballots so Trump's opening pitch to voters is essentially are you better off now or were you better off when I was president now he's routinely touted the record strength of the economy under his watch and points to the recent aggression by China and Russia as a sign that America needs his brand of tough foreign policy once more so you can expect that message to continue moving forward right so what are the big questions at the moment around Trump's campaign well the biggest right now at least from a legal perspective is the federal investigation regarding his story to classified documents after leaving the White House that along with a pending subpoena from the January 6th committee you know complicates his run for obvious reasons sure and there's also the pushback he's getting from within the Republican party right now tell us about that yeah beyond the legal side of things there are some serious fractures among Republicans now make no mistake about it a sizable portion of the Republican base is still fully on board with four more years of trouble you just have to turn on one of his recent campaign rallies to see how fervent many of his supporters are but you cannot ignore the growing faction of Republican voters and GOP leaders who are saying it's time for the party to move on from Trump and they pointed the lack of success among Trump endorsed candidates in the midterms now Trump disputes those claims and says that the majority of candidates who he endorsed won and he is right but critics say that most of those victories were in non-competitive districts they point out that in toss-up states that Biden won like Pennsylvania Arizona and Nevada Trump endorsed candidates went two for 11 on Election Day and in States like Arizona and Georgia the non-trump endorsed candidates paced well ahead of those backed by Trump and look his age is also a factor here it's been brought up he'd be in his early 80s by the time his term ended and that had has led to questions about his electability and we've started to see some Republican officials going on the record saying that they wouldn't want another Trump term yeah we have it's been interesting and it's worth pointing out it's not just the more moderate you know never Trump faction of the party that's opposing him for example Senator Cynthia Lumis of Wyoming when asked if she would endorse Trump said quote I think the question is who is the current leader of the Republican party oh I know who it is Ron DeSantis whether he wants to be or not again president Trump still has significant support among the party base and more than a few allies in Congress and governors Mansions around the country and remember he's also got a massive campaign War chest after he and his Allied pacts raised tens of millions of dollars over the last few years so by most metrics he's still in a solid spot to win the primary but the race is going to be a lot more interesting than many people would have expected and it feels like the 2022 race is just ending exactly here we go again Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's

Thermo their most powerful fat incinerator absolutely free text wire to two three one two three one that's wired to 231-231 the governor of Texas Greg Abbott called Monday for an investigation into what took place on voting day in the most populous county in the state the pressure comes after the county was plagued by widespread machine malfunctions supply shortages and confusing court rulings here to discuss is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim first off what happened in Harris County on Election Day hey Georgia Harris County where Houston is located had a bad election day starting from the time polls opened to pass the time when they were supposed to close the trouble began when a number of ballot machines malfunctioned some of those problems lasted hours and forced precincts to turn voters away at least 23 precincts either ran out of supplies part way through election day or came close to running out some of those precincts were able to get more supplies from neighboring polling stations but others closed their doors early and never reopened additionally some voters were filling out multiple ballots because of malfunctioning machines so there was a huge discrepancy between the number of ballots cast and the number of Voters who checked in at first the discrepancy was about six thousand but that number was later revised down to about 2 000 but as you can imagine the whole situation was chaotic and voters were pretty upset and rightfully so toward the end of the day a local circuit court judge issued an order to keep some polling places open past the 7 PM closing time because of the morning's delays that ruling was struck down by the Texas Supreme Court work but thousands of people cast ballots past closing time anyway another court order the next day allowed officials to keep counting ballots past the mandatory cutoff time now Houston is a very blue area but Republicans tend to vote in person on Election Day so it seems like both parties would have a reason to be upset about what happened what is each side saying the Harris County branch of the democratic party called Abbott's push for an investigation almost laughable the county party accused Abbott of trying to get better results for Republicans while potentially criminalizing election workers Republicans were much tougher on the county and election officials Harris County has had election problems before in fact Harris County's previous election administrator resigned in April over similar issues during the primaries County GOP officials held a press conference last week going over some of the election day problems here's GOP County chair Cindy Siegel I'm representing the Harris County Publican party and I can tell you we're going to fight this I'm tired of this crap being going on in our County you want to talk about voter suppression voter suppression is when you can't go into a poll it's not open voter suppression is when you don't have equipment that works and voter suppression is when you don't have the paper to record your ballot well hopefully Abbott will get some answers voters are rightfully upset about this Tim thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wire reporter Tim Pierce foreign the Paris climate agreement was signed almost seven years ago but pledges to reduce greenhouse gases have not materialized and the global Community is not on track to reach its climate goals at this year's climate change conference in Egypt President Biden discussed his climate goals for the U.S even as countries appear to not be on the way to meeting the goals of the deal here to give us the details on the current state of the agreement as daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond hi Charlotte so where do we stand on this agreement and which countries are involved hi John so overall none of the four largest producers of greenhouse gases have cut their emissions enough to reach the Benchmark set by the Paris agreement those emitters are the U.S India China and the EU that's according to new information that was released by climate action tracker and independent organization as reported by the New York Times China has the highest amount of emissions and those emissions have been increasing over the past 20 years the country puts out almost one-third of all greenhouse gases released by humans on the planet that's more than the U.S Japan and Europe all put together and China's emissions are getting close to their Peak amounts yet the country hasn't put out new emissions reduction schools this year all right so China is by far the furthest from reaching any of these benchmarks what about the U.S how are we tracking on this so far the United States put out Berkeley and is still one of the highest emitters per capita President Biden has pushed for more climate change agenda items and the Democrats pushed through the inflation production act which has a lot of federal money for green energy projects including tax credits for wind turbines and solar panels nuclear power plants and carbon Capture Plus help for electric vehicles right many thought the name of the bill didn't actually reflect its main focus which is climate change policies in many ways now the U.N just held its 27th annual climate change conference in Egypt Biden was there on Friday what came of that right so President Biden said the federal government is going to force oil and gas producers to find and secure methane leaks the Environmental Protection Agency put out a proposal Friday that it claims would get rid of 36 million tons of methane emissions from oil and gas Productions by 2035. he also upset some activists because he didn't talk about so-called climate reparations which some European leaders have said they were in favor of and some poorer countries were unhappy with the us because they think wealthier Nations should do more but Biden insisted that the U.S will reach its emissions goals by 2030 and acted as if the inflation reduction act money for clean energy can assist other nations here's some of what he had to say science is devastatingly clear we have to make vital progress by the end of this decade challenges we Face are great but our capacity is greater than the challenge we must never doubt that he also announced a massive spending package to help Egypt move to clean energy and proposed a new rule that would force all major federal contractors to announce their missions and climate-based monetary risks and create goals to bring down emissions okay so what about Europe how are they looking with the agreement goals the EU reduced its emissions in recent years but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has set them back Russia drastically cut energy supplies to the EU and has created a pretty dangerous situation ahead of winter that has forced most on the continent to try to find other energy sources Germany has ramped up its coal mining and imports to get more resources before the cold winter months and European citizens are struggling under high energy costs the EU is making those progress of the four emitters toward reaching its pledges to cut emissions but again they come at a cost well we'll see where the public stands on all this in light of surging Energy prices Charlotte thanks for reporting that was daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond [Music] another story we're tracking this week

liberal are about 15 points less likely to be completely satisfied with their lives than their conservative counterparts daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham is here to explore what's driving the political happiness Gap so Megan studies like these always seem to spark a lot of social media commentary but there's some pretty fascinating breakout data in this particular study hey Georgia yeah there is so I think we need to start by adding the context that the fact that there is a happiness gap between left and right is actually not news polling companies first started surveying people about overall life satisfaction in 1972 and the results have consistently found that conservatives tend to be happier than liberals now the thing that has changed is series about why that is so some sociologists have argued that it has to do with their views on meritocracy whether or not you think someone gets ahead by working hard which also ties in with feelings of agency and then religious beliefs also seem to have a strong correlation to happiness and conservatives tend to be more religious in 2015 Science magazine ran a paper that essentially argued conservatives just think that they're happier and finally conservative commentator George will once joked that maybe it's all this news about conservatives being happier that's depressing liberal but the latest research has also shown some interesting dichotomies between men and women that offer some new clues about what's going on here so both liberal men and women are less happy than their conservative counterparts but liberal women are a lot less happy on measures of mental health for instance they registered a full 20 points lower than women on the right now I spoke to University of Virginia sociologists and American Enterprise Institute fellow Brad Wilcox about that huge disparity and he said much of it comes down to two key areas when you hear the statistics here behind these kinds of Trends what you see is that two family factors being married and being satisfied with your family helped to explain the gap between liberals and conservatives and hacking instrumental so we see that only 36 percent of liberal women say that they're completely satisfied with their families compared to 61 of conservative women and again there's no Gap is as large in family satisfaction in the data as there is between liberal women and conservative women so Wilcox points out that conservatives are about 26 percent more likely to be married and they're also more likely to have children and the latest research shows that parents are happier than non-parents modern progressives are statistically less inclined toward traditional marriage and family now he said the question of marriage and family impacted men's happiness and mental health as well but not as much as women so that's where that biggest disparity lies so left-leaning women are kind of dragging down the scores disproportionately correct that's right now you say they have 50 years worth of data has the happiness divide dovetailed with marriage rates during that whole time Loosely yes it has as the Gap in marriage has been growing so has that happiness divide and that does seem to suggest that the difference could be coming more from how our political Outlook influences us to order our personal lives I think the problem for progressives is that they're not kind of partaking of the benefits of having a spouse the benefits of living a family-centered lifestyle because a lot of the values and virtues that they Embrace don't Point them directly in the direction of families now what about religiosity I imagine that's pretty hard to disentangle from Marriage rates since religious people tend to get and stay married correct right that's correct and that's something that Wilcox and a fellow researcher have been looking at pretty closely and it turns out those factors are tough to isolate because as you mentioned religious Faith does tend to promote marriage and family and religiosity correlates with happiness and by the way that holds whatever your religious Faith whether you're Protestant Catholic Jewish Muslim what have you so maybe we need to spend more time talking about those factors being drivers of happiness than our political views Megan thanks for reporting anytime that was daily wire culture

has been fraught with political dealings that have contributed to the issue here to give us the details is daily wire's Charlotte Pence Bond so Charlotte what can you tell us about the project well California ever actually see this train good question John California's bullet train was supposed passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco by way of the Central Valley in around 2 hours and 40 minutes you may have heard of the bridge to nowhere but right now this is potentially the train to nowhere and the artifacts of that failure massive cinder blocks not the Central Valley of California and are daily reminders of a project that might never be completed the New York Times looked into the project and really found that politics is a huge reason for the Train's failure so take us back how did this all start in 2008 Californians voted in favor of an almost 10 billion dollar bond for the rail line and it was supposed to be done by 2020 and cost 33 billion dollars now it's obviously 2022 and not a single mile of this project is done one of the main concerns is where construction was started in the middle right in the Central Valley this was a political agreement people in favor of operating it through Central Valley Cities made some compelling arguments such as the need for employment opportunities in the area and because it's mainly agricultural land so it'd be less difficult to construct it there but this led to even more complications right right this shifted the route from the West to the East and would be expensive it also leads to more setbacks and issues over getting the land needed as well as additional environmental concerns here's Governor Gavin Newsom in his first state of the State address in 2019. the current project as planned would cost too much and respectfully take too long there's been too little oversight and not enough transparency right now there simply isn't a path to get from Sacramento to San Diego let alone from San Francisco to L.A this summer a deal on California state budget provided the last 4.2 billion dollars of that Bond funding for the project and established a new Inspector General role to hopefully help move things along that agreement allowed this 171 mile span of the railroad in the Central Valley to continue the state's High-Speed Rail Authority has spent over 1.4 billion dollars purchasing land in the middle of the state too which has also been a main reason for the setbacks so some of it is being constructed now yes some of phase one is being built linking some cities in the center of the state that's supposed to be done by 2030 but there are a lot of doubts if that's possible final plan for the cost is now projected to be 113 billion dollars and no one knows where the money to connect the train to LA in San Francisco is going to come from now other countries have made bullet trains and been successful so what's the main issue here it really looks like political infighting is to blame since that led to changes that affected the long-term success sncf which is the French government rail operator wanted help with the project but when their recommendations were ignored they pulled out of California in 2011 and began a project in North Africa sncf was able to build a fully operational bullet train in Morocco in seven years a career project manager told the times that sncf left California for North Africa because it was quote less politically dysfunctional not exactly a ringing endorsement of California politics Charlotte thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Charlotte Pitts Bond [Music] the world's most lucrative Sports League the NFL has suffered a series of PR hits over the issue of concussion protocols after an unsettling on-field collapse of a star quarterback the league has already made some major changes that could impact the sport and one doctor has already been fired here to discuss is sports writer and crin and Company co-host David Cohn hey David hi John so for those who haven't followed this over the last couple of weeks catch us up to speed her sure so this mainly revolves around Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua tagoviloa who took a hit about three weeks ago during the team's match-up against the Buffalo Bills he began stumbling while coming off the field and everyone watching immediately knew something was wrong Tua left the game after that play but returned for the second half after medical evaluation and managed to lead the Dolphins to a win so despite what appeared to be clear signs of cognitive impairment he was greenlit to go back into the game correct and he was cleared to play four days later and that's where things get disturbing he took the field against the Cincinnati Bengals in a prime time Thursday Night Football matchup and during the first half of that contest two was tackled and then immediately showed signs of head trauma when he raised his hands near his face mask which is a reflex known as the fencing response following this scary scene Tua was carted off the field and he has not played since yeah that footage is pretty hard to watch yep so it seems clear that tuo was not fully recovered from the hit on Sunday yet still played Thursday night I guess the big question here is who's at fault yeah and that's the the overarching question the NFL and the NFL players Association conducted an investigation and found that protocol was followed in evaluating tagoviloa but also acknowledged that the outcome in this case was not what was intended when the concussion protocol was drafted okay the Players Association which has long criticized these Thursday night games due to the quick turnaround has the ability to terminate the consultant which is called the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant in these situations and it exercise that right by firing the neurologist who initially cleared Tua okay so that move was made by The Players Association not the league both can do it in this case the nflpa is the institution that made the decision and in addition to this firing the NFL made revisions to its concussion protocol writ large specifically as it relates to Ataxia which is the medical term for the poor muscle control associated with concussions this can manifest as unsteadiness or slurred speech or stumbling so moving forward any player who is diagnosed with Ataxia will not be allowed to return to that football game alright so changes made by the NFL have we seen any impact from these changes in games over the past few weeks well there were several roughing the passer penalties handed down this past weekend from Fairly innocuous tackles some people around the league are calling this coincidence but many others believe this is a direct result of the NFL attempting to fundamentally change the the game now we had Sports Science Creator John brenkus on our show craning company as well as former NFL quarterback Danny Cannell on this week and both made the same statement physicality is a part of football that's why they're wearing helmets it's why they're paid handsomely at the NFL level and now we've been in college to take on that risk and every player who puts on the uniform and puts on a helmet is aware of that risk I think the NFL would be far better served to just admit it to be like you know what it's a risky game and we're trying to do our best to protect the players but we can't protect them all the time deal with it so while the league will undoubtedly continue looking for ways to make the game safer John we must acknowledge that football is a contact sport and if you take away the contact it's no longer football yeah I guess there's just no way around it and all involved know what they're getting into yep David thanks for coming on thank you that was Crane and Company co-host David Cohn another story we're tracking this week Tulsi gabbard has officially begun campaigning for New Hampshire senatorial candidate Don Baldock bolduck has received support from former president Trump and his challenging incumbent Democrat Senator Maggie Hassan thanks for waking up with us we'll be back tomorrow with the news you need

I'm daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley with Georgia Howe it's Monday October 10th and this is morning wire another high-profile University Hospital backs away from transgender treatments for

application pricing not available for everyone need to hire you need indeed [Music] as inflation remains stubbornly high and recession woes continue the U.S labor market was dealt a blow this week with new data showing that job growth slowed considerably in the month of September here is more on what's driving the Slowdown and how it's impacting the economy as daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot you've been digging into these job numbers what's the latest so we just got the latest jobs report and it showed some concerning signs according to the labor department in the month of September the U.S economy added 263 000 jobs now that might sound great but when you zoom out it's actually a 16 drop from the month before and a 34 drop from the monthly average over the first half of the year so a clear slowdown going on yeah and another element from the latest data that's a bit deceiving is the unemployment rate which dropped to 3.5 percent again that's great on its face but if you look at the reason for the drop it's mainly because the labor force itself dropped so it put simply more Americans stopped looking for work last month so a lower unemployment rate but also a reduced labor force what's causing the Slowdown there as always are a lot of factors at play the first is that as we enter a recession employers are simply doing everything they can to prepare and one obvious way of doing that is by keeping their payroll as low as possible we've seen anecdotal evidence of this over the last few months with big companies announcing Mass layoffs or hiring freezes but this is much more concrete evidence that companies are not optimistic about the future it's also a sign that employers are preparing for more rate hikes from the FED chairman Jerome Powell has been pretty clear as we talked about on the show that their goal is to further slow down hiring to try and combat inflation and one way of doing that is by just making it more expensive for businesses to borrow money so unless something drastic happens don't expect rates to drop anytime soon which could be bad news for people looking for a job as employers simply pull back how much they're spending so what sort of response have we seen from the Biden Administration to this report well President Biden is actually touting the report saying it's further evidence that the economy is doing well he's consistently pointed to the fact that we've now had job growth for 21 consecutive months but critics have been quick to point out that those jobs weren't necessarily being created as much as they were being recovered after lockdowns ended which obviously were a time when you know jobs around the country were really decimated and all this comes as the stock market is really struggling yeah after years of bullish growth on Wall Street we are firmly entrenched in a bear Market the job report sent the markets tumbling even further on Friday with the Dow Jones ending the day down 630 points the Dow has now erased every gain it made over the last two years and is lower than it was in November of 2020. wow and you know this is bad timing for President Biden and Democrats politically speaking yeah this is another one of those tangible issues where voters can see the impact of a struggling economy for themselves all they have to do is look at their 401k or mutual funds on that note we've already seen some Republicans on the campaign Trail increasingly referencing the market decrease since Biden took office their point is that people would have more money saved up if they simply buried everything they'd earned since 2020 in their backyard instead of investing it in the market all right so if you can give us some reason for optimism about the economy yes let's get to some good news on this Monday morning and that is the strength of the US dollar when you look at the real effective exchange rate which just tracks the dollar compared to every other major currency the dollar is at an all-time high it just broke the previous record set 20 years ago it's up 13 this year alone and is at its strongest Point against the British pound since 1985 and the strongest Point against the Euro since 2002 but even when there's good news in this economy there's still always another side to it it's negative and in this case it's that as the dollar Rises it actually hurts domestic manufacturing that's because our products become more expensive in other countries which hurts our export rates while simultaneously making foreign Goods cheaper to import which can undermine American-made products so it really Cuts both ways it always does cabot thanks for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Vanderbilt University Hospital announced on Friday that they are discontinuing gender surgeries for minors pending an internal review the news comes after the hospital made national headlines when videos surfaced showing doctors discussing how much money could be made from transgender medicine joining us to discuss is daily wire investigative reporter Murray delordy summary what's the latest out of Vanderbilt hi Georgia so on Friday Vanderbilt University Medical Center released a letter stating that quote we are pausing gender affirmation surgeries on patients under 18 while they finish an internal review which they said may take several months and how did this particular gender Clinic get into the news in the first place well an expose from the daily wires Matt Walsh revealed several shocking videos that showed a Vanderbilt doctor calling certain transgender surgeries huge money makers another surfaced video showed a health law expert calling conscientious objections to transgender surgeries problematic saying people who didn't want to participate in these procedures shouldn't work at Vanderbilt after the videos came to light a Groundswell of lawmakers called on Vanderbilt to Halt its gender services for children Tennessee's Governor called for an investigation there's also a planned rally for later this month at the state house over the issue so the clinic is responding to a growing course of concern before Vanderbilt halted gender Services the clinic was performing so-called gender affirming double mastectomies on girls under 18 and also offering puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for minors now is this a sign that the medical establishment is moving away from early medical intervention for gender confused kids maybe this is the second high-profile hospital to back away from this type of treatment in just the past week University of Oklahoma Medical Center announced they were terminating their gender Clinic last week all of this is in response to a growing movement of parents who are extremely skeptical about these types of treatments there was an interesting report in Reuters just a few days ago about the risk of permanent medical interventions that don't have long-term data it's been rare to see that point of view printed in Legacy Media Outlets but with the explosion of trans identifying kids and the proliferation of these clinics we are definitely seeing more people asking questions that said in the past few months we've also seen wpath which is the world professional association for transgender Health put out official guidance that removes the minimum age requirement for transgender treatment seemingly opening the door to more aggressive treatments at younger ages so it's probably more accurate to say we're seeing a growing Schism between the public and the medical establishment on this issue now the statement from Vanderbilt says that they're pausing treatments pending review do we know what new information they're reviewing Vanderbilt said its internal review will look at the new wpath guidelines which as I mentioned advocate for early treatment so it's very possible the hospital will resume these treatments in a few months barring any laws passed in the state outlawing the treatments however we're also seeing a growing movement of detransitioners speak out and their voices might become important as hospitals decide how to proceed going forward these are people who thought they were transgender and medically transitioned but now regret it and have transitioned back to their birth gender some of these detransitioners have begun lobbying against these treatments which they say cause irreparable harm for example a group of de-transitioners wrote a letter to attorney general Merrick Garland just last week so it's becoming a contentious issue at the national level very contentious thanks so much for reporting thanks Georgia that was daily wire investigative reporter Marie delordy [Music] just a month out from the midterm election the race for Congress has taken Center Stage but several Governors contests are playing out alongside the battle for the House and Senate one in particular has been raising eyebrows as it tightens reliably blue New York state was not thought to be a Battleground governor's race and yet Republican candidate representative Lee zeldin has significantly narrowed the once double-digit lead of the incumbent Democrat Kathy hokel here to discuss as columnist David Marcus hadev this kind of came out of nowhere how close has this race gotten uh the polls vary and all still show something of a Hogle lead but several surveys have shown zeldin in Striking Distance and people are starting to notice this had been a very sleepy race for months but zeldon is well funded and he's been running a lot more ads and sort of barnstorming the state the backdrop is a sense that New York City in particular is moving in the wrong direction and that obviously has a huge impact on the state as a whole hokel had been running very quietly hoping to win on the big Democrat Edge and voter registration but she's also being much more aggressive now this is a race what are the issues that are driving the campaigns now that were just a few weeks out that's easy for zeldin it's crime crime crime I mean his ads feature a lot of the brutal viral videos of crime on the streets and in the subway that uh listeners have seen on social media and hokel has been and continues to be a champion of the bail reform laws that a lot of New Yorkers blame for Rising crime for hokel as with uh many Democrats across the country abortion has become the centerpiece of her campaign uh she's painted zeldin's position as extreme and his running ads featuring women who need abortions for medical reasons uh that she alleges he would make illegal how significant would a republican victory in New York be oh it'd be a very big deal the last time a republican won Statewide in New York was 20 years ago when George Pataki won the governor's race a win this year would be further evidence that the gops making inroads with new groups of Voters and look there's frustration with the state government hokel took over after Andrew Cuomo resigned in disgrace and you know now she has her own Scandal involving coveted test tracks that she gave to a donor part of zeldin's pitch is that Democrats have been in charge for two decades and it's just time for a change how much of this race will come down to New York City as opposed to the rest of the state the city has about half the population leans more Democrat than other areas is zeldon focused much on the city yes he is the traditional magic number for Republicans to win Statewide in New York is about 33 percent of the New York City vote zeldin has said if he tops that he thinks he wins um so far he's had a lot of focus on what we call the outer boroughs places like Brooklyn and Queens where there's are significant pockets of Republicans as well as Staten Island which is a GOP stronghold there are some wild card voting demographics including Hispanic and Asian voters who both candidates are courting pretty hard now New York was an early epicenter of the covet pandemic and had some of the toughest restrictions in the country throughout most of that time was under Cuomo not Hogle but are the lockdowns still a big issue in the race or have voters moved on not as much of an issue as I might have expected likely because things in New York have basically returned at least to a new normal um but it's interesting there are four races in which sitting Governors made starkly different choices about covid so uh Rhonda Santos and Brian Kemp in Florida and Georgia respectively opened their states um Team Cuomo slash hoko and Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan locked down very hard yeah so far all four of them are ahead in the polls but hogle's no shoe-in anymore and it may well be that covet frustration is part of why while some very interesting developments in New York David thanks for coming on thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus we're tracking this week a bomb damaged a 12-mile bridge connecting Crimea to Mainland Russia on Saturday in a major threat to Russia's supply lines into Southern Ukraine here to give us a brief update on the bridge attack is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce hey Georgia a bomb either carried by a tractor trailer or planted beneath the bridge by boat detonated and collapsed part of a bridge that is the only ground link between Crimea and Mainland Russia the bridge has four lanes of traffic and two Freight Lines the bomb collapsed the outer two lanes of traffic and it appears to have significantly damaged at least one of the railroads Russian officials said Sunday that commercial traffic had resumed on the remaining two lanes but heavy trucks are banned and trains are again running from Crimea to Russia but officials said nothing about trains running the other way on the other track Russian officials immediately blamed Ukraine Keith did not claim outright responsibility for the attack but Ukrainian officials openly celebrated the damage to the bridge the bridge was completed in 2018 at a cost of nearly 4 billion dollars and as the main artery supplies for Russia's war effort in southern Ukraine well thanks for waking up with us we'll be back this afternoon with more of the

that gender dysphoria is a phase that most children outgrow daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham is here now to tell us why England's national Health Service is shifting gears and what President Biden said this past weekend so Megan let's start with the NHS over the last several years a lot of the momentum seems to have been on the side of expanding access to transgender treatments but more recently we're seeing Europe pull back this most recent announcement was kind of a bombshell to that effect what did the updated guidelines say well essentially the NHS says that in most cases children who think they're transgender are actually just going through a phase and they'll grow out of it it also said that medical personnel should not encourage kids to change their names or use pronouns or do things that conflict with their biology it's now Banning puberty blockers unless they're being administered during a strict clinical trial and it's also requiring that any gender dysphoria treatment of children be led by medical doctors not therapists now it's important to note that this is coming just a few months after the NHS shut down the only transgender clinic in the country dedicated to treating minors because a review found that it was not safe the Tavistock Clinic is also facing a barrage of lawsuits from former patients who regret making some irreversible changes to their bodies well this is part of a larger Trend in Europe that we've covered before on this show which is kind of the opposite of the direction that we're going here in the states yeah that's exactly right you know Finland and Sweden were previously at the Forefront of this affirmation approach but over the course of 2021 and 2022 both countries moved to ban puberty blockers and transgender surgeries for those under 18 in most cases now I want to talk about President Biden he recently sat down for an interview with a trans Tick Tock star to clarify his administration's position on this issue how did that meeting transpire and what did he say right so he sat down with a tick tock influencer named Dylan Mulvaney who is a 25 year old biological male but who identifies as a girl Mulvaney's Tick Tock account which has 8 million followers is titled 100 days of girlhood well Mulvaney recently shot to fame on social media for chronicling what it feels like to now be experiencing a quote girl's childhood and in September Mulvaney was invited to speak at Forbes power Women's Summit and then last week the Cosmetic Company Ulta featured Mulvaney in a promotional interview and in that case the interviewer was also a trans woman now I know I can find love I know I can still be a performer I know that I can have a family I want to be a mom one day and I absolutely can so Mulvaney appears to have caught the attention of the White House Now President Biden gave an interview to The Tick Tock influencer who asked him about states that have passed measures to ban transgender procedures and medications this was Biden's answer I don't think any stage or anybody should have the right to do that as a moral question as a legal question I just think it's wrong so these statements dovetail with an executive order Biden signed in June and it directed the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that children are able to access transgender treatment overriding various States efforts to ban that practice the order itself prohibits doctors and therapists from counseling patients against pursuing a gender change so it's pretty much diametrically opposed to the new guidance in England now it's important to note that 75 percent of American voters with an opinion on this issue believe that the transgender movement has gone too far that's the wording of the poll by encouraging minors to use drugs and surgeries to change their gender well this is a huge culture War issue right now Megan thanks for reporting yeah anytime that was

here are the latest numbers from Georgia and how record-breaking early voting is impacting The crucial race there as daily wire senior editor Kevin Phillips okay Cabot let's look at these numbers what are we saying well for the first time since September Republican Herschel Walker is in the lead against Democrat incumbent Rafael Warnock for the state's Senate seat according to our exclusive new poll with the Trafalgar group Walker is sitting right now at 48.9 percent while Warnock is down at 46.5 and one other nugget that jumped out Walker is currently at 88 percent among Republicans while Warnock barely cracked the 80 threshold so it does seem that there could be a bit more Unity among the Republican Party base compared to the Democrats something to watch as the election day approaches what's driving that momentum shift well beyond the persistent economic struggles that we all know we're driving voters towards Republicans we've also seen a negative news cycle for Warnock there was a story that broke recently about an apartment complex owned by the churchy pastors that was sending eviction notices to low-income tenants some who reportedly owe just a few hundred dollars now that story along with another Revelation that he'd been receiving a seventy four hundred dollar a month housing stipend from his church appear to be causing more like problems right now as voters are making their final decision so it's a bad timing for him and there was also the recent debate yeah the debate definitely played a role here as well a lot of Voters seem to be waiting to see how Walker would perform you know he's not really known as a polished speaker and there was a lot of interest in how he would address those recent allegations that he had paid for an abortion for a woman back in 2009 but by most accounts he alleviated a lot of concerns and came out with a strong performance on that note we talked to Robert kahali from the Trafalgar group here's how he put it the way he dealt with the pro-life question and talked about abortions in the city of Atlanta the way he uh constantly tied things back to Biden by Mike Walker referred to Baden 37 times and you know tying or not to Madden is the way to win the election and one more interesting stat from this poll Walker was sitting 23.5 percent among black voters and 39.8 percent among Hispanic voters those numbers are double where Republicans have been in past elections and if they hold on Election Day would be a massive realignment that would obviously have National implications if it extrapolates out to you know other races we also got some important insight into the governor's race with this poll what did we find there this one is more solidly red Republican incumbent Brian Kemp holds a 52-45 advantage over Democrat Stacey Abrams that 52 number is very important because in Georgia candidates have to get a majority in order to avoid a runoff right and Kemp not only scored 92 percent of the Republican Party showing that he's really unified the base but he's also got a 14-point lead among Independents 14 points like Warnock Abrams has been hampered recently by some negative press tell us about that yeah Politico recently broke a big story that detailed how fair fight action that is the non-profit founded by Abrams paid out more than 9.4 million dollars to the law firm of Abram's close friend and former campaign chair that move is really drawing suspicion not only because it was paid out by her non-profit over just a two-year span but also because the firm is relatively small now that story has really come at the worst time for Abrams who was already struggling to win over Independence and now it looks like her nonprofit may have been paying out money to her friend and former campaign chair another October surprise in Georgia Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips and for those wanting more on the midterms tune in to this Sunday's election wire show the video version of the show is available on YouTube and the audio is available on the morning wire feed foreign 's report cards are in and student scores are the lowest we've seen in decades the catastrophic drop in scores is widespread hitting elementary middle and high school students also released last week was a report from the makers of the ACT which showed student academic performance cratering to 30-year lows here to give us some insight into the falling test results is daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond so Charlotte test scores for American kids are dropping hi Georgia yes for the 2022 graduating class the national average ACT composite score was 19.8 that average is not dipped below 20 since 1991. now is this primarily linked to school closures not completely this marks the fifth year in a row that the average scores have gone down so this started before the pandemic but other indicators suggest the lockdowns were catastrophic for learning the ACT also has benchmarks of minimum scores which predict whether students will be successful in their college freshman year in the class of 2022 the number of seniors who didn't reach any of the benchmarks went up 42 percent of the class of 2022 didn't reach any and only 22 percent got all of them and we're seeing drops in grades too the nation's report card or the national assessment of educational progress and AEP was released on Monday showing that math grades are down among students in fourth and eighth grade fourth graders saw a score Five Points below the 2019 average and 8th graders scored eight points lower the drops in naep scores do seem to be associated with the pandemic so if this college test decline predates the pandemic what's driving it certainly lockdowns were a factor especially for low-income kids who may not have had access to Tutors or parents at home but deeper issues in education policy could also be playing a part here I spoke to Nicholas Giordano about this he's a professor of political science at Suffolk Community College in New York and a higher education fellow with the leadership institute's campus reform he says one of the major issues is that schools are passing students to the next grade even if they aren't ready well something we've also reported before on this show is that schools are spending a lot more time on things like social emotional learning I actually used to teach middle school math so it's hard for me to imagine how I would squeeze in lessons about social issues is there any evidence that some of these trendy educational movements are having an effect on kids achievement in the basic skills right yeah we've definitely seen a wave of parents making that exact argument speaking of unhappy parents education turned out to be a huge factor in the Virginia Governor's race last year do we expect that it's going to be an important factor in midterms it could be there's some evidence that Democrats are pivoting on educational issues which suggests they're responding to Growing pressure to support things like school choice for example Democrat Governor of Illinois J.B pritzker recently said he was in favor of the state's tax credit scholarship program that gives money for kids to go to private and parochial schools this is a major shift especially in the deep blue State just five years ago he opposed the program and said he wouldn't support School vouchers Professor Giordano made the prediction that Democrats are underestimating the importance of Education in this election I think there are a lot of parents that people don't realize the bitterness and resentment that they had that the schools had failed all kids and I think they will turn out to vote between the mass the vaccines closing schools down distance learning has proven to be an utter and dismal failure parents are fed up and I don't think they're going to take it much longer particularly in Suburban communities well he's not the first person to say that education could be a sleeper issue issue this cycle Charlotte thanks for reporting thanks for having me that's daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond other stories we're tracking

    "bmtwjfiPzmg": "[Music] President Biden is set to meet with Chinese president Xi Jinping in person for the first time in his presidency at the group of 20 Summit in Indonesia on Monday the face-to-face meeting comes as relations between the U.S and China grow increasingly strained in light of this meeting we're taking a look back at a previous Sunday edition of morning wire where we discussed the growing threat of China and their Espionage abroad hey there producer Colton here do you like to be the first to know about trending news and current events if so you got to get the daily wire Plus app not only will you receive mobile notifications whenever something's happening but you also have access to the best commentary to break it all down download The Daily wire Plus app and keep up with the facts no matter where your day takes you here to discuss the rising China threat as daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips alright Cabot so you've talked to a host of experts on this topic give us some context on China and their efforts to replace the us as the dominant Global Force so by now most people are well aware of the fact that China is one of our leading adversaries from a foreign policy perspective but most people would be shocked if they knew the lengths that the Chinese Communist party or CCP is willing to go in their efforts at world domination and just how close to home many of those efforts now are right now the Chinese are actively spying on universities and paying American professors millions of dollars in exchange for their sensitive research they're stealing billions of dollars worth of intellectual property through cyber attacks they're dispatching spies to observe our farming practices and they're even expanding their reach in South and Central America to gain a foothold in areas that are close to the US I'll get into the details on each of those points but first I think it's helpful to understand how they view themselves on the global stage right that's key tell us more there Chinese leaders and their culture more broadly are deeply proud of their role throughout history as one of the oldest and most powerful civilizations on Earth and after falling behind Western Nations over the last few centuries they're Now intent on Reviving a new golden age as their president Xi Jinping calls it and they're willing to play the long game that's key I talked to Dean Chang he's the senior research fellow at the Heritage Asian studies Center here's how he put it so from China's perspective all they're saying is you know we had this bad period the so-called Center of humiliation we lost out to the west but we're back and we appreciate you the West keeping our seat warm so to speak but we'll take it from here so what is it that they want to do they want to be the absolute dominant power in Asia they want to be first among equals among the great Powers they seek to buy the mid-century conveniently the 100th anniversary the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. they want by 2049 to be a superpower realistically only rivaled by the United States if even the U.S let's get to some of the specifics what can you tell us about China's influence on American college campuses yeah this is one of the areas where the CCP is especially Brazen officials there have openly referred to American universities as soft targets for Espionage research theft and the spreading of propaganda according to the U.S Department of Defense China steals 136 million dollars worth of American intellectual property every single day that amounts to about 50 billion dollars a year and much of that theft takes place on college campuses where American academics are essentially paid off in exchange for sensitive research and other information over the last five years there have been dozens of instances where professors researchers and even students have been caught secretly transmitting materials to the CCP often in exchange for cash payments or grants so this is a lot of money we're talking about here yeah what are some of the examples of what they're transmitting so the most high profile case came from Harvard University in 2020 Charles Lieber was arrested after it was discovered that he'd been secretly sharing sensitive research with the Chinese in exchange for fifty thousand dollars a month and it's worth pointing out Lieber was not some random Professor either he was the chair of Harvard's chemistry department and according to the FBI he was even paid by the Chinese to help their scientists open up a lab at the Wuhan University of Technology Wuhan yes Libra was eventually convicted on six felony charges after it was proven that he falsified IRS documents to hide the money he was getting from the Chinese and that he also lied under oath multiple times regarding his affiliation but that is just the tip of the iceberg there was a professor at UCLA who was convicted of smuggling research on guided missiles and fighter jets to the Chinese another West Virginia University who was convicted after taking paid paternity leave but instead of helping raise a child traveling to China to share American Research and help develop the Chinese Academy of Science chances all in exchange for a quarter million dollars one professor at Ohio State had received a 4.1 million dollar Federal research grant for Immunology but it turns out he was employed by the Chinese all along and was secretly transmitting all of that taxpayer-funded research over to the CCP when a co-worker called on to what he was doing that Professor hopped on a chartered flight to Alaska with a series of Chinese passports cash hard drives and other material but thankfully he was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison the list really does go on and on you can get into a bunch more cases and unfortunately students are often caught up in the Espionage as well now this is a touchy subject it really is what do we know about student enrollment so look it's no secret that many International students on U.S campuses come from China in 2021 there were 317 000 Chinese students on campus that accounts for 35 percent of all foreign students in America sadly these students are often taken advantage of by their government according to human rights law the CCP will often Force International students to return back to China with sensitive research or other intellectual property and threaten their families at home if if they don't come back with it basically if a student doesn't comply then their parents could be thrown in jail have their businesses shut down by the Communist party or face other forms of persecution for example one student who had been working as a research assistant at a hospital in Boston was called trying to smuggle 21 vials of sensitive cancer research on a flight to China and he claimed he was forced to do so by the CCP wow now you mentioned propaganda efforts on campus can you elaborate on that yeah back in 2004 the Chinese government began sponsoring so-called Confucius institutes on hundreds of campuses around the world including many here in the U.S now according to the Chinese Confucius institutes are simply centers of cultural exchange they offer Mandarin courses Chinese cooking lessons and other harmless sounding events but according to our DOD and intelligence Community these centers are actually CCP hubs designed for spreading Chinese propaganda engaging in academic Espionage and monitoring the activities of Chinese students on campus by 2018 there were over 100 of these institutes here in America 100 yeah they were quite widespread now the Chinese often reserve the right to hand pick the teachers used in these centers meaning American students are learning about Chinese history and culture from professors chosen by the CCP and those faculty are also typically used to influence the curriculum regarding China to shape what students are learning in other departments and the CCP doesn't really make an effort to hide the true intention of these centers which is to spread propaganda for example in 2011 Lee Chang Chun who was at the time the leader of China's propaganda Department said this quote the Confucius Institute is an appealing brand for expanding our culture abroad it has made an important contribution toward improving our soft power the Confucius brand has a natural attractiveness using the excuse of teaching Chinese language everything looks reasonable and logical now he mentioned soft power there how was their approach in the U.S different from other countries yeah it's really important to understand how the Chinese are expanding their efforts in the Western Hemisphere to gain a foothold closer to the U.S they've invested billions of dollars into what they call the belt and Road initiative which is really just a clever way of getting developing countries deeply in debt to the Chinese Communist Party essentially China will go to a country and offer to build a high highway system or power plant on credit so that governments in developing countries will take out billions of dollars in loans from the Chinese export import Bank to pay for these projects which they've been promised will pay for themselves through commercial profit and economic growth so a similar quid pro quo like they offer on American campuses exactly but what usually ends up happening is that the projects fail to offer a return on investment and leave these small countries hugely in debt to the Chinese government for example Kyrgyzstan which shares a border with China took part in the Belton Road initiative in exchange for a railway system that stretches across the entire country they took out billions in loans for the project and when it wasn't as profitable as they'd been promised they're now unable to pay for it as a result 42 percent of their national debt is now owed to China 42 and if they default on payments by the way the Chinese government gets to seize control of that Railroad and in turn gain a key spot of territory in the region so basically a trap posing as a jobs program essentially yes the Chinese government and other supporters tout the initiative as a means of quickly building out the infrastructure of developing nations and expanding their trade opportunities but if you look closer it's actually a form of what experts call debt trap diplomacy here's how Dean Chang described the origins of the Belton Road initiative and how it's being used today started as a giant jobs program for for trying to steal and cement Industries they had built pretty much everything they wanted to build in China they had all this uh industrial capacity what to do with that answer export it go abroad sign contracts build power plants highways fiber optic cable lines Railways in other countries using Chinese steel Chinese cement and importantly Chinese labor and as chain describes that's when they spring the Trap as they started doing that what they realized was that a lot of these countries weren't particularly well off so they'd have to finance so the Chinese said hey we have huge capital accounts or pluses because of our trade surpluses so we'll use that money to fund you Kenya you Nigeria you Kazakhstan to buy our steel and cement Etc at some point they also realize you know if they owe us money we have huge influence over them we've also heard a great deal about intellectual property theft China's notorious for that what more can you tell us about that issue well this is another area where they are extremely Brazen the Chinese government has employed a literal Army of hackers to steal as much technology and information as possible from governments and businesses worldwide one hacker group there known as Double Dragon has close ties to the Chinese Ministry of State security and has reportedly stolen get this over a trillion dollars worth of intellectual property including military blueprints pharmaceutical formulas and other sensitive material much of which by the way has not yet been patented and that's just one group keep in mind there are many of these groups throughout China most of which are getting funding and support from the CCP itself according to FBI director Christopher Ray China is Far and Away the bigger cyber threat we face the bigger hacking program than that of every other major Nation combined they have stolen more of Americans personal and corporate data than every nation combined so as the war in Ukraine continues and Putin looks to expand his influence do not forget China they are more than happy to go into the radar but they are still the largest threat that America faces on the global stage Kevin thanks for

    "5SY-hJo-Dr4": "the United States has seen an unprecedented number of migrants Crossing into the country illegally with border patrol apprehending more than 2 million plus nearly 600 000 additional gotaways the influx of migrants has taken a massive toll on residents of Border towns and drained massive resources from border states on the Sunday episode of Morning wire we talk with Virginia Allen a senior news producer with the daily signal who recently visited multiple border towns and talked with several locals law enforcement personnel and migrants to find out what's really going on at the border I'm daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley with Georgia Howe it's October 9th and this is your Sunday edition of morning wire [Music] hey there producer Colton here do you like to be the first to know about trending news and current events if so you got to get the daily wire Plus app not only will you receive mobile notifications whenever something's happening but you'll also have access to the best commentary to break it all down download The Daily wire Plus app and keep up with the facts no matter where your day takes you Virginia thanks for joining us today now you recently traveled down to the southern border with a production team to hear firsthand from locals law enforcement and migrants themselves about this crisis which has reached historic proportions this year so first tell us about this trip you just took so I went down to the southern border I was in San Antonio Del Rio Eagle Pass in Kinney County and obviously San Antonio is a little bit more Inland but um for all of those other cities there right along the Rio Grande and these are communities that are dealing with illegal immigration day in and day out and your focus was to see firsthand the impact of illegal immigration on these communities correct right so I went down there with really the purpose to understand what is happening to see it for myself and I had the opportunity to talk with local sheriffs to talk with a local Rancher an attorney for Kinney County and even to speak with some of the illegal aliens themselves in San Antonio I spent about half a day outside of a migrant processing center and I just asked folks you know why did you decide to come to America why come now and so many of them had a very similar answer they said yeah I've heard about the American dream I want the American dream I want a better life for myself for my kids but one even told me said I know I came illegally but he said you know I'm really thankful to be here and to have this opportunity to come to America but it was fascinating to see how the whole process plays out because I've heard so many individuals talk about the process of illegal immigration and here on the news kind of how it works but I literally saw firsthand how this system plays out multiple times a day in communities along the border so I'll give you an example I was in Del Rio and visited with a woman who lives a mile from the border her name's Teresa Esther and she said hey just drive down the road and kind of look and see what's going on down there because they're often picking up illegal migrants at the end of my street so we went down there and sure enough there was a small group of you know maybe five or so illegal aliens who just crossed the Rio Grande and they were being picked up by border patrol it was just sort of like any other normal Tuesday morning and they got into the van and border patrol drove them off presumably to a processing center for some of their basic information will be taken down and then the next step sort of in the chain of what happens is increasingly ngos are giving these illegal aliens bus tickets and plane flights to go into the interior of the U.S we know that they're going to New York City Chicago and Washington DC in great numbers and potentially also to several other cities across the U.S now there's been a lot of outrage among Democrats over Republican Governors bussing migrants but you're saying that the standard process right now is to let them journey into the interior of the U.S often to these same cities so they're arriving in these cities on a regular basis just not all at once collectively in groups that is the system right and we'll see the the really large groups of maybe a thousand or something come over at once but it is often these small groups of three or five or ten and it truly is a well-oiled machine because of the sheer numbers of a legal migrants coming across the border under these policies of the Biden Administration you know the border patrol has had to figure out a system to deal with this so they have and what I essentially saw was one we don't have a border for all intensive purposes America has no Southern border right now and two this process of illegal immigration under the Biden Administration runs very smoothly because it it has to in order to uh to support it in order to have these sheer numbers coming across and have it not be total in complete chaos so the policies of the Biden Administration are actually empowering and allowing 4 and a legal system of immigration to be perpetuated across the U.S and I believe that we're starting you know with things like the fentanyl crisis and you know we're starting to see the repercussions of this I don't think we're going to feel the full effects for years to come because there's all sorts of far-reaching effects when you're literally bringing thousands of individuals into the interior of the country and you know their kids who don't speak English are entering our school systems and they're putting a strain on our health care System the far-reaching effects are broad they're massive and we're going to feel them for years if not decades to come how do the locals feel about all of this did they feel open to be able to talk to you about this yeah they were very open and I asked several of them I said is there a divide in your community between Republicans and Democrats on this issue and they said no pretty much everyone's of the same mind that we need to secure the border and that was that was kind of my second follow-up question is well what do you think needs to happen and everyone said you know what step one is we have to secure the border and that's because these individuals who live in these border towns they don't feel safe the woman that I mentioned earlier Teresa Esther she described her house as looking like Fort Knox at night she's purchased all these lights and put up around the outside of her calm she's bought a guard dog she put a fence in her backyard because she's only a mile from the border from the Rio Grande and regularly there are illegal aliens running through her property border patrol trying to catch them she told me when I was there just the night before there had been a helicopter circling above presumably looking for an illegal alien who had crossed and was trying to avoid apprehension I spoke with another woman Laura Allen she and her husband run a ranch along the border in Valverde County she said you know she doesn't go anywhere on her property without a gun just because you never know she's very aware of the fact that illegal aliens are continually Crossing through her property and you talked to law enforcement as well what kinds of responses did you get from them it's it's sobering in many ways what law enforcement is having to deal with I met with the sheriff of Kinney County Sheriff Co and you know that that very morning I think we were meeting around 5 p.m and that very morning between the hours of 4 a.m and 8 A.M in his County they had apprehended five different human Smugglers who are trying to sneak individuals in to the county into the country and what often results in those situations of humans smuggling is high-speed chases so um you know they'll recruit often young people are being recruited to drive illegal migrants from the border into America and then you have you know an officer chasing that vehicle down and it's gotten to the point where in Kinney County they've actually put up a rock barricade around the school because that main drag that the school is on runs right for through town and they're fearful that during one of these high-speed chases a car is going to crash into the school so I mean this is the sobering reality that these people live with I I met with the sheriff in Val Verde County Sheriff Martinez and you know this was one of the most probably heartbreaking things that I saw while I was there but he has a binder on his desk just full of photos of dead bodies that have been found of illegal migrants along the border individuals who have drowned in the Rio Grande or who died of heat exhaustion he I could hardly look at it he showed me the photo of one woman who drowned in the Rio Grande who was pregnant with twins and I mean at the end of the day this is a human total human tragedy that you know all of these migrants are being sold the message come to America and that Journey that Trek is so so dangerous and unfortunately some of them don't make it and you said you talked to some of the migrants and they just said they wanted a better life in America did anybody talk about fleeing from persecution or violence from their home country they all talked about poverty they talked about the difficult situations in their communities none specifically mentioned though the violence that um that they were specifically you know scared because of you know political or religious persecution and you know I was speaking with aliens who were from the nation of Colombia as well as Venezuela and you know of course we can empathize and say absolutely and it makes sense to want a better life that there has to be a system in place to do that legally there has to be a process in place to do that legally I was really fascinated one of the gentlemen who I spoke with he was kind enough to show me the papers that he had been given by Customs and Border Patrol that was sort of the steps for what he was supposed to do next and it just told him uh to be in touch within 60 days to be in touch with a local ice office and to report to a local ice office it was written in English which I was fascinated by because he didn't seem to speak English he seemed to only speak Spanish and it was interesting to me that it wasn't that he was told you need to hear an ex-location for your Asylum hearing by this date it was just within 60 days get in touch with us and we'll you know schedule your Asylum hearing so it's really putting a lot of onus on the illegal aliens themselves to be willing to you know take the steps to schedule those Asylum hearings and show up and unfortunately we knew that out of fear of deportation a lot of these individuals don't ever show up for those Asylum hearings right only a really small percentage ever do show up for those hearings now you talked about drivers being recruited to smuggle over migrants the cartels are behind a lot of this what did you see or hear about the cartels when you were visiting these border towns yeah so there's a lot of concern both from border patrol and locals about um you know the role that the cartels are playing in illegal immigration and this year numbers that are coming across in the drugs that are being smuggled and and certainly concerned for the safety of both the aliens themselves who are often dependent on those cartels to come to America and Americans themselves I when I was speaking with one of the gentlemen outside the migrant processing center he was from Venezuela and he said it cost him about two thousand five hundred dollars to come to America and you know that was kind of paying as he went and I I have to assume that quite a bit of that money went to cartels the cartels you know they play such a heavy role such a a big role in this issue of illegal immigration and some of them are crossing over themselves but you know many are just sort of directing things from Mexico or wherever and you know they're sending people in they're sending um the drug carriers in and meanwhile they're making tons and tons of money on the backs of of individuals who are desperate final question is there anything that particularly stuck out to you that you felt defines the situation on the border by the fact that the Bible administration's policies are actually facilitating illegal immigration and that's both from my words what I gathered and from the words of the Kinney County attorney Brent Smith he told me that um and it was evident I think to actually see with your own eyes oh this you know this isn't just something that's happening in the dark or you know that they're trying to hide it it's wide out in the open and nothing's being done to stop it and to realize oh right now I'm living in a country where we really don't not only do we not have a secure border like for all intensive purposes we really don't have a border um as far as our Southern border was sobering and shocking and the fact that the body Administration doesn't seem to be concerned by that uh that they're not changing anything in their policy is even more sobering because that means that you know there's not going to be there's not going to be a change likely anytime soon well this issue is increasingly paying a toll on the rest of the country but in these border towns as you've highlighted the price is really steep Virginia thanks for joining us thank you our pleasure joining today that was Virginia Allen senior news

prestigmo so Amanda we have really significant some people are saying historic developments happening in several cities across China what's going on right now hi Georgia yeah things are really escalating across China especially in major cities like Beijing Shanghai and Wuhan but these are being called the biggest demonstrations against the government since Tiananmen Square leaked videos and foreign news coverage show police pepper spraying and beating protesters protesters are calling for Freedom they want the end to lockdowns basic human rights and they're specifically calling for president Xi Jinping to step down which is very significant here as we witnessed early in the pandemic China's Draconian zero covet policies are preventing Chinese citizens from going to work from buying food from accessing hospitals which has been fatal people are being arrested for not wearing masks and continue to be sent to quarantine camps some videos even show Chinese authorities welding door shut to lock people inside their homes now why are these protests happening now after years of these policies was there something that specifically triggered it well there have been sporadic protests for several weeks now but a fire on Thursday at a residential high-rise in the city called arumti seems to have been a catalyst for Nationwide demonstrations according to the Chinese government 10 people died in the fire but many people suspect that number is far higher video seems to show people inside the building screaming to quote open the door and save us and and just a note here a room T is known to be a predominantly weaker area although many residents are also Han Chinese after that fire there was a candlelight vigil outside the high-rise that turned into a protest which led to more protests elsewhere in the country we spoke to Stephen Yates former deputy National Security advisor during the bush presidency about this here's what he had to say well I think it's an accumulation of things as often happens the Chinese people have faced pretty incredible enforcement of these lockdowns it's more from that sort of horrific prison life existence to people just getting physically beaten ruthlessly in the streets and I think the most combustible event was the video footage of a family being burnt alive because they were locked inside their domicile due to these the shutdown and I think that was just one of those catalytic events that was seen as a last draw now have Chinese authorities responded at all to these protests right now it looks like they're focused on cracking down and containing the protests videos are showing beatings arrests and the deployment of pepper spray there was even a reporter from the BBC who was assaulted by police while covering the protests on Sunday there's some really nasty video of that there's also been an effort to censor protest footage from leaking online platforms like Twitter Facebook and Tick Tock they're banned in the country but Chinese citizens have found some clever ways to circumvent Those sensors about two weeks ago the airdrop function on iPhones that was curb because people were using it to share information and censorship itself is actually a major theme in these protests as you might imagine a major symbol of the protest is a blank sheet of paper which represents silence in a lot of these videos you can see protesters holding up blank sheets of paper including at the candlelight vigil outside the apartment building the government has been extremely Vigilant about suppressing hashtags associated with the protests so so the workaround has been posting these blank squares life has become increasingly tough in China over the past few years the economic growth has slowed unemployment is spiking especially with young people in the country's housing market is in serious crisis and with the rise of the internet Chinese citizens are increasingly aware of the freedoms people have in other countries but it remains to be seen whether this round of protests will achieve any major change right well we're going to continue to monitor this Amanda thanks for reporting

on potential tenants a city council committee is set to move forward on the measure in spite of concerns from those opposed to the legislation that it poses a danger for families in the city here to discuss this columnist David Marcus hey Dave so what exactly would this law change and who would it apply to morning so basically private landlords would no longer be able to do criminal background checks on people applying for apartments currently they're free to do so you know in addition to things like credit score checks or proof of income it does not interestingly apply to City run housing projects which serve about 350 000 of the city's roughly five or six million renters or to people who are just renting a single room but it's going to impact a vast majority of units so it's a very significant change and it's a serious limitation for landlords now critics of the measure have been very vocal in their opposition especially as it comes amid a general rise in crime in the city what are their complaints here but the big one is safety especially at a time when when there's so much recidivism and also very lacks bail laws landlords and other tenants of course uh may want to know if a heart and criminal is moving in upstairs but but more broadly it's also a question of the freedom that a property owner should have to decide what to do with their own property a lot of units in Gotham are owned and operated by big management companies but many are just houses or buildings owned by private individuals who want a measure of Direct Control yeah now people who get out of prison obviously do need places to live is there concern that without this new law they won't be able to what problem is this actually meant to fix I I'm not sure to be honest uh this is the city council committee on civil rights so they seem to want to promote equality for the formerly incarcerated but I mean it's not clear that such folks aren't able to secure housing obviously thousands and thousands already do the point opponents are trying to make is that it should be up to the owner could there be enough opposition in the public and on the council to actually stop this bill or is it pretty much a done deal I think it's a done deal there's a handful of Republicans on the city council and a few more moderate Democrats but I the vast majority of the body is basically to the left of the Mad Hatter's tea party so I mean it'll probably pass and again those safety concerns are real this is more about just a failure to read the room even mayor Eric Adams who ran as a tough on crime guy seems on board with the law and I really do think it's going to leave a lot of people here just scratching their heads yeah probably so Dave thanks for joining us thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus on Monday the New York Times along with four major European news outlets published a letter in support of Julian Assange who has been held without trials since 2019 in London Calling on the U.S government to drop charges against the founder of WikiLeaks with Moore is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips so Cabot for those unfamiliar with Assange and the charges against him can you just give us a background of course so Julian Assange is the Australian publisher who founded the site Wikileaks which among other things allowed whistleblowers and leakers to platform to share often top secret information from inside government institutions around the world remember they were behind the 2016 DNC email leaks that showed the party's leadership was trying to ensure Hillary Clinton won the party nomination right so in 2010 Assange and Wikileaks started publishing a series of leaked archives that featured classified diplomatic cables and Military documents those leaks contained decades worth of communication between diplomats and the U.S state department and offered unprecedented insight into American Espionage and diplomatic efforts around the globe they also showed that our government had committed serious war crimes in the Middle East and that our military had misled the public about the number of Civilian casualties during the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan essentially it was a huge embarrassment for the United States now back in 2010 Assange was seen as sort of an icon among the anti-war crowd because he was exposing wrongdoing by the US government although many in that crowd later turned on him when he released information about Hillary Clinton several years later at the time Assange reached agreements with five Outlets to begin publishing many of the confidential cables that he'd uncovered in a series of Articles starting in 2010 and while the Obama Administration did at the time prosecute Chelsea Manning the former Army intelligence analyst who was responsible for giving the documents to WikiLeaks they declined to charge Assange himself but in 2019 the justice department under President Trump reversed course and accused him of violating the Espionage Act along with other crimes related to the league shortly after the charges were made official Assange was arrested as part of that American warrant in 2019. right and just to clarify Assange was living in the Ecuadorian Embassy for seven years correct he could not leave the premises without being arrested so a lot of people sort of likened at the time served but he's actually been in prison for three years now awaiting trial keep in mind if convicted he faces up to 175 years in prison but because of legal challenges to his extradition he's still yet to face trial in the U.S but that could happen soon okay and now suddenly the times and some other outlets have come out in support of him why now well earlier this month the justice department released new guidelines that formally prevent the government from forcing reporters to reveal their sources and expand protections for journalists those new rules mean that if the case against Assange went forward the doj would presumably have to go after the New York Times as well which obviously puts them in a bind on Monday they along with four large news outlets in Europe including the guardian in England published an open letter calling on the U.S to end their pursuit of charges against him they day's prosecution quote sets a dangerous precedent and threatens to undermine America's First Amendment and the freedom of the press the letter also points out that the Espionage Act has never been used to prosecute a publisher or broadcaster of information It Ends by claiming that disclosing sensitive information is a key part of what journalists are meant to do even if that information is meant to be confidential now you touched on this earlier but Assange has been controversial for years what's the reaction been to this well for obvious reasons Assange has become quite the polarizing figure critics say that he belongs in jail because he released top secret information that could have doxed undercover agents and put American lives at risk they view the issue as being less about Freedom of Information and more about National Security but there are plenty of people who view Assange as a hero and say that we have a right to know if our government is lying to us and in this case covering up war crimes so now the question becomes whether he'll be extradited to the U.S and what happens if and when he is all right well we will continue to monitor Cabot thanks for reporting anytime and happy birthday oh thank you so much I should get some credit

coffee foreign as inflation continues to hit new record highs and the cost of energy is spiking ahead of winter President Biden is making a controversial last-ditch effort to bring down gas prices before midterm elections here are the latest is daily wire senior editor Kevin Phillips so Kevin tell us about the latest move from Biden well after a summer that saw the highest inflation in gas prices in American history there was finally some good news for the White House over July and August as gas prices started to come down into the early fall but now they are shooting back up really quickly and the White House is clearly desperate to get them down before election day for obvious reasons a recent Trafalgar poll shows that 54 of Americans say rising gas prices makes them more likely to vote Republican while just 32 percent say it makes them more likely to vote Democrat right and that's where the oil Reserve comes in exactly the president announced late last week the release of another 15 million barrels from the nation's emergency oil stockpile this is uh the final stage of 180 million gallon release that the president promised back in the spring Republicans say the move is more about PR than actually lowering costs given the fact that the country right now goes through 20 million barrels a day so you know 15 million doesn't really make much of a dent there is also some pushback on the president's attempt to lower gas prices by negotiating with the Saudis what do we know there well we all remember Biden's now Infamous meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince where he was seen on camera fist bumping the country's tyrannical leader right well the main point of that meeting was to convince the Saudis to hopefully increase oil production in a bid to lower prices here in the States but that meeting failed as the Saudis and OPEC announced earlier this month that they would go the opposite route and would actually start cutting production by 2 million barrels a day starting in November which is going to cause prices to go up even more right before election day so that was bad enough but then the Saudis made a pretty shocking claim last week they issued a statement saying that President Biden had urged the Saudis to wait until after November midterms to make that decision on oil and threatened economic consequences if they did not in their words it was a ploy to avoid bad news ahead of the election now Republicans say that that constitutes a quid pro quo and that Biden was basing foreign policy decisions on political whims so not a good look we know gas prices are going to impact voters on Election Day but zooming out how is the broader state of the economy impacting things now well we've talked plenty about National Trends showing that many voters who earlier in the year had listed social issues as their top priority Now list the economy as number one the latest polling from Reuters for example shows that 44 percent of Voters list the economy as their top issue no other issue even cracked double digits but in those key Battleground States we're seeing even more evidence of the impact that the weak economy is having especially in states with Democrat incumbents so while Republican challengers in States like Nevada and Georgia can promise something new it's look it's tough for Democrat incumbents to run on a message of I'll fix the economy when you know they were the ones in power as the economy tanked yeah you can see why that might not be as effective this cycle yeah and to that point the latest polling does show that even the majority of Democrats are now dissatisfied with the state of the economy so those more model Democrats maybe the ones that aren't as likely to vote in off your elections like this might be less motivated than usual to show up for their party and one final note here the latest polling from CNN had two very interesting nuggets first they found that in the most competitive congressional districts around the country Republicans not only held a 48-43 lead on that generic Congressional ballot but among voters who say the economy is quote extremely important to their vote which is a sizable portion of the electorate Republicans were up 26 points 56 to 30. yeah that's pretty sizable and clearly the economy is the defining issue of this race we'll keep following the latest developments Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's a daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips coming up migrant deaths at the southern border hit an all-time high [Music] if something were

year not only is fiscal year 2022 the highest on record for migrant encounters it was also the deadliest here to discuss the latest border numbers is daily wire's Tim Pierce Tim welcome thanks for bringing me on so Tim walk us through what DHS released last week sure Georgia the Department of Homeland Security released September's border numbers on Friday evening it was the last month in fiscal year 2022 and it was a doozy the number of Migrant encounters at the border for the month of September tallied nearly 230 thousand that's the highest tally for the month of September on record because September is the last month of the fiscal year the report also included yearly totals it turns out 2022 shattered records for both migrant encounters as well as migrant deaths total encounters for fiscal year 2022 were just shy of 2.4 million the number blows past the previous record of 1.6 million set just last year if you factor in the number of documented gotaways in 2022 total migrant encounters for the fiscal year should be closer to 3 million right now we've been tracking migrant encounter numbers pretty closely on this show but something you mentioned that we haven't discussed much is migrant deaths you said that 2022 was also the deadliest year on record what were those numbers well according to the data released Friday border patrol agents have recovered the bodies of over 850 migrants who apparently died trying to cross into the United States illegally it's the highest number of Migrant deaths in a single year at the border on record it includes migrants who died in all manner of ways attempting to enter the country often dehydration heat or drowning I should note that Friday's data also showed that border patrol arrested 20 known or suspected terrorists in September that brings the total number in 2022 up to 98. for reference the number of known or suspected terrorists arrested at the Border in the prior five years combined was just 26. so in light of those numbers as the Biden Administration made any comment about what they plan to do at the border they have not issued a formal statement about the new numbers but that's not so surprising because 2021 also set records for these numbers and that did not spark much change in approach either the administration is primarily focused on processing migrants rather than stopping them at the border Biden has tried to get more cooperation from governments such as Mexico and caring for migrants but he has had limited success the Administration has made some changes around the margins though for example they eliminated a policy that guaranteed entry for migrants from Venezuela that policy seems to have had a significant impact after it was announced the number of Venezuelan migrants stopped at the border dropped from about 1200 a day to around 150 a day right that seems to be very significant now DHS released this report at around 11 pm on Friday night is it fair to say they did not want much press coverage of this issue yeah some reporters said the administration appeared to be slow walking the data's release even before it was published the numbers received some attention over the weekend though Congressman Henry Cuellar is a democrat in Texas and one of the most vocal critics of the administration on the left side of the aisle he said Sunday that the numbers showed that the border is far from secure here's Cuellar talking to Fox News I saw the numbers from the Venezuelans have dropped out uh I I actually want them to do that to every country if we do that to every country the numbers will go down we will be able to control our borders and that's important to us that live along the border while Henry cuer is also fighting to hold on to a very purple District in Texas this is a very important issue for them Tim thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wire's Tim Pierce a new report by The Wall Street Journal shows that some federal officials are heavily engaged in trading stocks often in Industries or with companies they oversee or help regulate here are the details is Eric Eggers the co-host of the drill down with Peter Schweitzer who's been covering this issue so Eric first why does it matter that federal government employees are buying and selling stocks in high volumes so there's a couple concerns but the overriding one is the idea that people are leveraging positions to buy or sell stocks based on non-public knowledge the other is that the idea that government officials are supposed to be regulating certain industries might favor a company if they hold stocks in that company and does this new report show that absolutely from the records of the Wall Street Journal looked at over 2 600 Federal officials own stocks and companies that were lobbying their Federal agency this includes things like 200 EPA employees and their family members collectively owning between 400 000 or up to two million dollars in shares of oil and gas companies on an annual basis for example the Department of Defense employees or their families owned between 1.2 and 3.4 million of stock and Aerospace and defense companies including some Chinese companies the United States was considering blacklisting at the time some of the individual examples the report revealed are actually pretty bad also yeah walk us through some of those if you would so a defense department official for Southeast Asia was buying stock in Chinese company Alibaba while the treasury Department was considering blacklisting the company two weeks after the guy purchased the stock when Alibaba wasn't blacklisted their stock Rose four percent and the official sold his stock immediately afterwards another Department of Defense employee this one's a scientist whose division was overseeing the testing of F-35 Jets bought stock and Lockheed Martin who makes the Jets weeks before the Pentagon announced that they would be buying one billion dollars more worth of those Jets from that company another example is a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations board's office in Oakland was holding Tesla shares as her office was pursuing complaints against the automaker Tesla and chief executive Elon Musk and actually while that investigation was ongoing she increased her holding to the company now your team at gai has been covering the issue of stock trades by federal officials for some time now right absolutely our organization was actually started after our president Peter Schweitzer wrote a book called throw them all out which exposed how members of Congress were buying and selling stocks and industries that they had committee oversight over so the public outrage over the revelations in that book and subsequent media coverage led to the passage of the stock act which required members of Congress to disclose their stock trades on a monthly basis and the stock act that's the stop trading on Congressional knowledge act that actually passed with bipartisan support so what happened here so that's really what's at the heart of this the Act passed 96 to 3 in the Senate and 417 to 5 in the house so that doesn't normally happen no but the problem is the act doesn't have a ton of teeth the year after its passage Congress quietly removed some of the provisions relating to federal employee disclosures so as a result you now have the activity that the Wall Street journalist discovered and what about the members of Congress themselves so there are more disclosures for sure but and this is interesting the PDFs of those disclosure forms aren't searchable which makes real-time monitoring more challenging and last year a series of investigative reports revealed that actually over 50 members of Congress had violated the act by not disclosing the transactions in time and there's no evidence that actually been subject to any fines or penalties definitely something that merits more looking into all right Eric thanks for reporting that's Eric Eggers of the government accountability Institute and co-host of the drill down podcast with Peter Schweitzer other stories we're tracking this week president Xi Jinping China's most powerful leader in decades was awarded a third five-year term as General Secretary of the Communist party on Sunday author Salman Rushdie a high-profile critic of Islam is on the mend after an August

Dave Chappelle is reportedly facing another round of Industry boycotts this time at Saturday Night Live daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham is here now to tell us about the latest controversy surrounding Chappelle so Megan it seems like Hollywood or at least some of it may not be ready to re-embrace Dave Chappelle what's going on yeah maybe not because there are reports that some staff writers at SNL are still pretty upset about what Chappelle said in that special and that was titled for those who forgot the closer so also just to further refresh everyone's memories a little bit here since it has been over a year what he did was make some jokes about transgender people and in particular his comments about trans activists attacking Harry Potter author JK Rowling Drew quite a bit of outrage and in Canada because she said in an interview and it's not exactly what she said but effectually she said gender was a fact and then the trans Community got mad they started calling her a Turf I didn't even know what that was but I know that trans people make up words to win arguments Turf is an acronym stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist this is the real thing I'm team jerseys I agree I agree man gender is a fact you have to look at it from a woman's perspective so just a small sample there but because of that Netflix saw a staff walk out over its decision to air the special despite complaints from some trans activists and their supporters and that ultimately ended with Netflix co-ceo Ted sarandos telling employees that if they didn't feel like they could work on material they disagreed with then they'd just have to work somewhere else so that brings us to Saturday Night Live so the show book Dave Chappelle to host for the third time this Saturday and word is that some of the staff writers are boycotting after Chappelle's appearance was announced one of the writers who identifies as trans and non-binary posted an Instagram selfie from SNL's 30 Rock Studio with this message and I'll just quote transphobia is murder and it should be condemned but that said Chappelle's reps say he didn't see any evidence of a boycott when he visited 30 Rock for show meetings last week SNL is not responding to Media requests for comments so far now what about the SNL cast any word from them well reports are that they're happy to perform alongside Chappelle and there may be some pretty good reason for that so at the end of last season we saw one of the largest cast member turnovers ever in the show's history eight Stars left and that included three of the biggest names of recent years Kate McKinnon 80 Bryant and Pete Davidson the last time we saw turnover that big for the cast was in 1995. now along with that the show has also been struggling in ratings recently in fact last year's season opener was the lowest Premiere in the show's history and like a lot of late night comedy SNL has also suffered from some criticism that it's too political two partisan people say it almost exclusively makes jokes at the expense of the right in fact you've even heard some left-wing critics arguing that the show has been too soft on President Biden so SNL Creator Lauren Michaels has not said much about those accusations but he has said that season 48 is going to be a year of reinvention and apparently booking a lightning rod like Chappelle who counts some conservatives among his fans may be part of that reinvention now has Michael's ever addressed the fact that SNL seems to be pretty partisan or has he justified at all why they make fun of the right so much more than the left he did actually in 2014 he said it's because Republicans are better able to take a joke he basically said that they tend to find caricatures of themselves funny while Democrats tend to take it personally interesting well Megan I'm going to count on you to watch that and then you can report back for me I will do that all right thanks so much that was daily wire

Airline Staffing shortages brace yourself for a difficult holiday travel season that's according to Airline CEOs here to give us the details is daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond Charlotte Holiday Travel is notoriously hectic and people are likely excited to be fully traveling again but what can Travelers expect this season in particular high prices and long lines that doesn't sound good right Delta CEO Ed Bastian recently said that Travelers booking flights in advance for the holidays are up a lot more than last year an average round-trip ticket is going to be around 380 which is 38 percent more than it was in 2021. Haley Berg a top Economist for the travel app Hopper she said that the cost of flights are already 40 percent higher or more than they were last year and at least 20 to 30 percent up from 2019. there are also some shifts in how people are traveling Chief commercial officer for United Airlines Andrew nocella said people are booking flights on different days around the holidays rather than all on the same day people who work remotely can be a little more flexible than they used to be if they worked in an office if that makes sense what are some reasons for the high costs it seems that prices would go down as restrictions on travel loosened up you would think even though more people are traveling now than during the pandemic a lot of airlines aren't doing as many flights as they used to the cost of jet fuel has almost doubled and of course there were recently still Staffing shortages it's a good idea to try and buy your flights early and also to be flexible because a lot of money can be saved if you travel on those surrounding days or in the actual holiday booking an earlier flight can also help avoid delays and if your flight is canceled you can also try calling the international number of an airline which can go around the domestic line that's an interesting trick there so those Staffing shortages you're talking about those were huge this summer do we expect to see cancellations like that again hopefully not airlines are addressing the lower levels of Staff by cutting back on flights and they've been trying to hire more people in a recent interview Transportation secretary Pete butterjudge addressed the tax dollar spending that went to Airlines during the pandemic and how it impacted Staffing these dollars these taxpayer dollars that went to rescue the airlines they did have strings at that if you took that taxpayer money you couldn't turn around and fire people left right but there were still a lot of early retirement but for people including pilots who were very hard to replace it takes a long time to train a pilot they were nudged into early retirement or at least encouraged to do that in a way that left the airlines with without some of the uh resilience and Readiness they needed of course we also know that many airlines enforced covid vaccine mandates that affected how many people they had working for them too yeah that was a major factor in some of those shortages well there's a lot to watch here as the holiday season picks up Charlotte thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond [Music] three major stories rocked the Sports World this week involving Washington Commander's owner Dan Snyder WNBA star Brittany Greiner and Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets here are the latest is sports writer and crane and Company co-host David Cohn hey David hey how are you good so let's start with Dan Snyder and the Washington commanders what's the latest there the attorney general for the District of Columbia Carl Racine announced this week that his office is suing Dan Snyder the Commander's organization the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell for colluding to deceive District residents and for not fully cooperating with an investigation into toxic workplace culture remember it was Racine's office which launched an investigation into the team around the time a U.S House committee was also investigating the organization regarding this workplace cultural misconduct some are questioning whether Carl Racine has jurisdiction over this matter considering the commanders are technically located in Landover Maryland but it's worth noting the team is being investigated on multiple fronts John including by the Attorneys General of Virginia and DC now Congress as well as the NFL so a lot of eyes exactly now as for Dan Snyder's future in the NFL he and his wife have retained the services of Bank of America Securities to consider potential transactions this could potentially include the sale of the franchise when asked if Snyder is considering a full sale of the organization or just looking for minority Stakes a commander spokesperson stated we are exploring all options it's worth noting Forbes currently has the Washington franchise valued at 5.6 billion dollars so if somebody buys this it's not going to be cheap it's not going to be me now there was also news released this week about Brittany Greiner that's the WNBA star who was imprisoned in Russia what can you tell us on that front the process has begun for Brittany Greiner to be transferred from the Moscow prison where she is currently incarcerated to a Russian penal colony the conditions of which are said to be much harsher and prisoners are often forced into labor this is a move that her family has feared since she was convicted on drug charges in August it remains unclear how the move will affect negotiations between U.S officials and Russia regarding her release the Biden Administration is believed to have offered convicted Russian arms dealer Victor bout in a two-for-one deal including Brittany Greiner and fellow American prisoner Paul Whelan Russia has apparently demanded more in return and they have also instructed U.S officials to keep any negotiations private yeah there's been a lot of attempts to get more information about that it's hard to get in other basketball news we have Kyrie Irving he's been suspended by the Brooklyn Nets for what many are calling anti-semitic Behavior what are the details of Irving's suspension yeah this situation continues to unravel Kyrie Irving tweeted a link recently to a controversial movie which many believe promotes anti-semitic sentiments the backlash from this action has been intense and Irving initially offered no apology he has now been suspended indefinitely by the Brooklyn Nets until he fulfills six conditions set forth by the organization the first of which is to issue an apology conditions two through five are really two complete sensitivity training with the Jewish community and meet with the Anti-Defamation League also a 500 thousand dollar donation towards causes and organizations that work to eradicate hate and then step number six after he completes one through five is to meet with Net's owner Jose Psy to demonstrate the lessons learned and that he understands the gravity of the harm done so far Kyrie Irving has only apologized we don't know about any of the other conditions now Mark Stein reports that the list could possibly have been crafted with the knowledge that Irving is unlikely to complete all six conditions which could lead to his release by the franchise Net's owner Josiah is clearly disappointed he said Kyrie appears to support a film based on a book which is full of anti-Semitic disinformation this is bigger than basketball John even corporate sponsors are retaliating Nike co-founder Phil Knight said this week Kyrie stepped over the line and that's why we ended the relationship definitely several situations in the Sports World to keep an eye on David thanks for coming on thank you that was Crane and Company co-host David Cohn

was called Wednesday night and Democratic representative Karen bass defeated billionaire businessman Rick Caruso here to give us the rundown of the election is daily wire's Charlotte Pence Bond so Charlotte what happened here hey Georgia this was a close race especially because carusoe held a lead during the first two days of the county but bass was projected to be the winner on Wednesday with decision desk HQ calling it for her with around 53 percent of the vote carusoe had around 47 percent both bass and Crusoe are Democrats but Caruso used to be a Republican and was widely seen as the conservative Choice bass seized on that and highlighted his former pro-life views and her political ads to Galvanize her Progressive base what do we know about Rick Caruso we know he was a registered Republican for decades and not just any kind of Republican Caruso served as a senior advisor to president Trump it's true and now he's taking a page straight from the Trump Playbook running false ugly ads against Karen bass blowing that right-wing dog whistle but even despite those attack ads Caruso actually got a lot of celebrity and even very Progressive endorsements I mean I'm thinking of jenk euger he's the progressive host of The Young Turks right he was endorsed by Katy Perry Gwyneth Paltrow Kim Kardashian Chris Pratt as well as Hollywood Mega hitters like Netflix co-ceo Ted cerantos and his wife Nicole Avant Avant actually served as the ambassador to the Bahamas under President Obama and she became passionate about cracking down on crime after her mother was shot and killed by an intruder in her Beverly Hills Home last year but ultimately bass dominated by wide margins with the mail-in ballots and she was able to pull a six-point win upon winning bass put out a statement saying the people of Los Angeles have sent a clear message it is time for change and it is time for urgency she also promised to solve homelessness and to make the city affordable for Working Families for his part Crusoe said in his concession statement that his Run quote made an indelible impact on this city and its people that will last far beyond the campaign Trail or election day now there's some interesting data regarding the ballots coming in post-election day that some La journalists are asking questions about tell us about that right so some flags have been raised over the fact that Caruso LED on Election Day by 51 to 49 but that lead disappeared when mail-in votes were counted each subsequent day after the election the ballot skewed dramatically towards bass at a consistent rate of 60 40. a split like that might be expected in a purple area because Republicans are known to prefer in-person voting but this is a puzzling Trend in a deep blue city where the vast majority of Voters are Democrats but some people are chalking this up to the city's attempt to be more inclusive by loosening the rules so more people can vote now what are the vote by mail rules in LA they're very loose last year Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law that made it so that all registered active voters in the state have to be sent a ballot to their last known address no matter what and voters have up until election day to postmark their ballot however ballots without a postmark or with a non-legible postmark are also still eligible to be counted per the Cal vote regulations essentially all ballots are accepted proponents of so-called inclusive vote by mail rules say they help get those from low propensity voters who might not otherwise show up on Election Day critics however say it opens the door to fraud or at the very least a ballot harvesting very interesting Charlotte thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond coming up the Democrats

Schumer called for amnesty and a pathway to citizenship for every illegal immigrant in the United States as issues at the border continue to Surge here to walk us through Schumer's remarks as daily wire reporter Amanda Presto Giacomo so Amanda what is Schumer calling for and why is this making news hi John so the Senators calling for full amnesty for all illegal immigrants as rationale was low birth rates so you specifically cited Americans having fewer babies than ever before as well as a worker shortage now more than ever we're short of workers uh we have a population that is not reproducing it on its own with the same level that it used to the only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants the dreamers and all of them because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here Democrats have been on board with amnesty for decades but these remarks from Schumer are notable he's calling for a pathway to citizenship which would likely include voting rights and therefore drastically change the electorate right this is one of the more overt calls for this from a Democrat and a leadership position we've heard how are Republicans responding to calls for amnesty like this well well some Republicans certainly are on board for procuring cheap labor through immigration measures we've seen this new wave of conservatives publicly accused Democrats of basically trying to import new voters to change the electorate Blake Masters a republican candidate who was just edged out in a senate bid in a border state of Arizona he made this charge in May they're doing this so that someday they can amnesty these people and make them voters who they expect to vote Democrat this is an electoral strategy for the Democrats their policies are so bad and so unpopular that this is the only way they think they can Shore a political power in the future so Schumer cited 11 million or however many illegal immigrants are in the country what is the number or estimated number now uh that's a good question we really don't know but humor there he's citing something that's super old that's an outdated estimate of about 11 million but a 2018 Yale study bumped that to 22 million so that's double right there and remember under the bidet Administration many trump-era immigration rules have been rolled back some have projected that another 5.5 million illegals have crossed the southern border on Biden's watch so the number could be as high as 28 million or so but again no one really knows right now we have to discuss the backdrop here as we've highlighted in the past there are glaring issues at our Southern border what's the latest with the Border crisis okay so right now it's estimated that nearly 8 000 migrants enter the US each day that's according to data that was obtained by NBC News in September there's also this issue of fentanyl Mexico is the primary source of illicitly manufactured fentanyl pouring into the U.S and of course the humanitarian crisis we're seeing right and things might get worse earlier this week a federal judge blocked the use of title 42 as a result of ACLU litigation title 42 enacted under Trump allows the U.S to immediately expel migrants on the basis of Public Health this was over covid-19 concerns a former border judge this week estimated that border crossings without title 42 will jump to 18 000 per day that's almost double what we're seeing now well amnesty measures in the past including one's humor has supported have been followed by an uptick in border crossings well it's already unsustainable at the border we can't see any more of a surge Amanda thanks for reporting me those daily wires Amanda prestigmo the surging crime rate across the country has begun to show up in a new corner of our society with a Spate of violence and other criminal activity on the nation's college campuses a shocking triple murder at the University of Virginia Which took the lives of three football players last week in a quadruple homicide at the University of Idaho have focused national attention on this growing problem here to discuss this columnist David Marcus so they first have these suspects been apprehended and are these tragic incidents part of a growing trend good morning uh the suspect in the UVA case has been caught and charged police had a good amount of information about him early on but in the Idaho case uh the Killer's still at large and while police say that it doesn't represent a wider threat to the community that's probably scant's Assurance to the people who live there especially given the horrible nature of the crime the police say it was committed with an edged blade this comes just months after you may remember a father was killed in his hotel lobby visiting his child at Marist College in New York so yes there's there's been a trend and it's a pretty awful one now Beyond these high profile cases how much do we know about crime rates and levels at our colleges is this something that experts have been looking into absolutely according to Paul Morrow a retired New York City Police Department inspector there's a 1990 piece of federal legislation called the Clary so that requires college campus crime numbers be tracked and followed but there are some problems for example he cites that Columbia University reported no aggravated assaults in 2021 but the NYPD numbers for the precinct in which the school is situated show far more cases so it's not clear that we have very accurate data but like these high profile cases as well as a general sense of ill ease have led students parents and faculty at a number of schools uh to demand more action from those schools okay what kind of actions are being demanded and do the schools actually have the capacity to provide the kind of security that's being asked for some colleges like Johns Hopkins and Baltimore are creating their own new police forces and others have been beefing up their police or security It's tricky because colleges don't want some huge Crackdown on campuses we tend to think of campus security as folks who tell students not to smoke grass in the quad or you know settle Petty criminal squabbles try to turn these into policing operations that can handle brutal murders is not going to happen so there really does have to be a working and transparent relationship with local police forces who were equipped to deal with these kinds of things yeah that makes sense now meanwhile last month Harvard reported that crime was down 10 percent in 2021 so is this a problem facing all colleges or are the Harvard numbers just an outlier again there are questions about how these numbers are reported um did crime take place on a campus near to it adjacent to it and more broadly inside of Harvard's numbers there's still some pretty troubling signs rapes went up from 16 the previous year to 22 in 2021 and motor vehicle thefts also skyrocketed murders obviously get the most attention but we need to see better data on a whole host of criminal activity not just to understand what is happening but of course to stop it or or mitigate it as much as possible meanwhile some schools are helping to raise awareness among students with guides to staying safe from crime that offer tips on how to do so what kinds of things are they advising it's pretty Common Sense stuff along the lines of if you see something say something but some schools like Penn State for example also offer alerts that can tell students if there's criminal activity and generally they're urging students to be mindful of their surroundings or as my dad used to tell me to keep their wits about them thank you for joining us David thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus foreign we're tracking this week Republicans in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on

    "qn9dCbmCrzY": "[Music] with control of Congress on the line the two political parties make their final appeal to voters you're going to elect the incredible slate of true America First Republicans up and down the ballot how have the closing arguments from Republicans and Democrats differed and what reasons for optimism do the two sides have I'm Georgia Howe with daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley it's Tuesday November 8th and this is morning wire as Republicans have gained ground in the polls in the closing weeks of the election Democrats have repeatedly sounded the alarm over alleged misinformation and voter suppression we discussed the risks and rewards of that electoral rhetoric and the morning wire team took to the road in recent weeks to talk with candidates and voters we hear from both in the key Battleground State of Arizona thanks for waking up with morning wire stay tuned we have the news you need to know [Music] here at the daily wire we are committed to winning back the culture part of that means supporting businesses whose values align with their own which is why I'm so very excited to tell you that we've teamed up with Black Rifle

Rifle coffee supporting veterans and America's coffee [Music] today Americans will get the chance to decide the outcome of crucial state and federal elections and make their voices heard at The Ballot Box with just hours to go before results start rolling in we're joined by daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot you're going to be live throughout the evening as part of our election coverage it's going to be a very fun night John it's going to be a long night get ready now candidates have been making their final push for votes all week what did we hear from both sides well the closing message from Democrats focused on two main things abortion and the state of our democracy and in the final month before the election Democrats have spent 214 million dollars on ads related to abortion that is almost half of their entire spending budget and the other big message we've heard from them is that Republican control of DC would be an existential threat to democracy for example here's a video with President Biden describing the supposed threat posed by Republican candidates along with the caption the fate of democracy is in your hands this is a path to chaos in America it's unprecedented it's unlawful and it's not America okay so that's the Democrats final push but Republicans have taken a very different approach what was their closing message their message has been really consistent all summer and that is the economy crime and immigration but Chief among those has definitely been the economy and for good reasons we all know by now it is overwhelmingly the top issue for voters for example here's president Trump talking about inflation last week at a campaign rally in Texas Biden and the democrat congress created the worst inflation in 50 years 9.1 percent but it's much higher than that you see your bills it's much higher so Americans are out voting now what's one thing giving each side reason for optimism yeah so there's definitely more to choose from for Republicans right now on that front but it's not all bad news for Democrats obviously they've still got a good shot to take the Senate especially if they can hold Nevada and Georgia and then pick up a seat in Pennsylvania but increasingly Democrats are optimistic about their odds in some Statewide races especially the governor's races in deep red Kansas and Oklahoma polling there shows a near toss-up which would be a huge shock when you consider that Trump won those states by 15 and 33 points respectively yeah that'd be a big surprise yeah and Democrats are also hopeful that polling this cycle is actually underrepresenting Democrat support but a number of Legacy polling out let's say that they've now corrected this go around and have taken steps to include more Republicans in their samples yeah we talked a good bit about the submerged voter effect among many Republicans who don't like taking polls exactly and what about Republicans why should they be optimist well at first there's a lot of optimism about the way that independent voters are breaking at the last minute we've seen a number of polls that show Republicans winning with independence by anywhere from 10 to 20 points and the main reason is that Independents do tend to blame democrats for the poor state of the economy for context every year Gallup tracks voter sentiment right before the election and found that during the 2018 midterms Independents said they leaned Democrat by an 11 Point margin and Democrats obviously had success there this year though that same poll found Independence leading Republican by a six-point margin so 17-point swing over the last four years a few more hours and we see how it all plays out Cabot thanks for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips and again we'll hear more from him this evening during the election coverage at dailywire.com coming up Democrats warn about election misinformation and voter suppression [Music] you buy homeowners insurance to protect your house and auto insurance to protect your car but what measures have you taken to protect the future of your children start with a will from epic will a will gives

showing that Democrats face a tough election night the party has increasingly warned about the impact of election misinformation and voter suppression the wire culture reporter Megan Basham now Megan in the final days of the campaign it's really sounded like Democrats are sounding the alarm about democracy itself should the vote go the wrong way yeah they have and you know it's an interesting strategy for Democrats to Pivot to these issues that are somewhat more abstract and arguably a lot harder to frame in clear legislative terms so namely as you said protecting democracy and also fighting misinformation and combating voter suppression now these warnings about alleged misinformation and voter suppression have turned a lot of heads because critics say they appear to be building up expectations for a loss and that could undermine confidence in the election so probably the big moment that marked this shift was President Biden's Union Station speech last week during that he repeatedly called up the image of the January 6 Riot that was almost two years ago and he tried to make the argument that Maga Republicans pose an ongoing and existential threat to democracy we can't take democracy for granted any longer with democracy and the ballot we have to remember these first principles so from there Biden went on to say that our Democratic Norms are under assault due to voter intimidation and suppression and that's something that Democrat candidates have been echoing on the campaign Trail to give you one example this was Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacy Abrams on MSNBC Sunday we know that black voters are often discounted and unfortunately this year black men have been a very targeted population for misinformation but we're actually looking at potentially record voter turnout this midterm season so how does that square with Democrats message that voter suppression is a big issue right and that is a very good question and Abrams essentially answered it by saying that what Democrats are talking about is targeted suppression of minority voters suppression has never been about stopping all voters it's about clogging the arteries of the process and stopping certain voters and there is a Precision to voter suppression but what we're hearing very little about from Democrats right now are those issues that Republicans are hammering things like inflation and crime and that's likely because it's been really hard for them to find an angle on those topics that favors them so instead what we're really seeing here is just a last-ditch effort to reorient the discussion now is there any sense that this shift in messaging is working you know I don't think so what you're already starting to see are the intra-party recriminations that inevitably follow any rough election season to give you just one example on CBS last week California governor Gavin Newsom said this and it goes to my fundamental great events with my damn party we're getting crushed on narrative we're going to have to do better in terms of getting on the offense and stop being on the damn defense in response to that Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar who's been out stumping for the Democrats pushed back she said on CNN that Newsome doesn't see what's happening accurately because he's in California while she's traveling all over the country so this tension among Democrats suggests that they don't feel confident that the messaging that they settled on in these closing days of the election is going to be effective enough to change the trajectory well I guess we're going to all find out later tonight Megan thanks for reporting my pleasure that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham [Music] the final polls show a tight race for governor in Arizona Republican candidate Kerry Lake holds a slim but persistent lead over Democrat Katie Hobbs now Georgia you spent a day in Arizona over the weekend and you talked to candidates and voters what did you learn well I really got the sense that arizonans may be more so even than residents of other states are dealing with national issues right up close so when they're talking about closing the border and especially about getting fentanyl off the streets I sensed that they're pretty desperate now here's some sound from a Blake Masters event I attended at an RNC Community Center in South Phoenix the fentanyl is outrageous out of him it's worse than heroin you see young children looking at the ground tripping out you can see when the drug dealer shows up because they're all getting high and it's sad it's sad that needs to change you need to start Prosecuting these people and letting them instead of letting them out of jail and close the border they need to close the border it's ridiculous and was fentanyl a big theme with a lot of people you spoke to there same border drugs crime those were huge and it sounded like voters really connected them together now you also spoke to some candidates how are they addressing this concern gubernatorial candidate Kerry lake has made closing the Border a centerpiece of her campaign she's actually promised to declare the situation an invasion on day one and to bring in the National Guard I wasn't able to secure an interview with her opponent Katie Hobbs but Hobbs has also endorsed a secure border but she's taken a softer tone compared to Lake as we've covered before Kerry lake has been a lightning rod in the media but the polls showed that a lot of arizonans really connect with her what was your impression so I can see why the media hates her she essentially declared war on them when she resigned from her post as a news anchor and she openly accused them of colluding to control a political narrative but when you look at public opinion polling the majority of Americans are actually highly suspicious of the media so it just it doesn't surprise me that she's winning in the court of popular opinion on that one despite all the negative headlines she also has the advantage of being a household name for almost 30 years which makes it really hard for Democrats to Brand her as extreme in the 11th hour now I also asked her what she thinks went wrong with the media here's what she said when I first got into TV news every station was owned either locally or by a family or they maybe owned one or two stations and then those got bought up by bigger groups now it's down to five or six corporate owners who own every TV station across the country that's five or six entities controlling all of the information and that's when we started seeing people who had experience in television getting pushed out because they made too much money replaced with four or five people straight out of Journalism school where they're actually teaching them to be activists and so newsrooms which typically were leaning left began to lean leftist and we can't begin to be a really big problem and I started to feel like we were being forced to lie about really important stories well the biggest criticism you tend to see in the Press is that lake is a so-called election denier what is her position on that yeah so she was still a news anchor during the election but after she resigned she made some pretty specific claims about election corruption and that's actually a particularly pointed charge considering that her opponent Katie Hobbs is the secretary of state whose job it is to oversee elections and Hobbes oversaw the 2020 election in Arizona and Hobbes is going to be overseeing the 2022 elections and I also want to get behind what happened in our elections we had a forensic audit the media doesn't want to cover that audit but when I go out to events and I ask people do you want reforms to your elections so that you know on Election night the results and you can live with the results whether your guy won or lost are you for that the crowd goes crazy people want election reform that leads to transparent fair and honest elections Kerry lake has become a candidate to watch this election cycle we'll see how voters in Arizona feel better tonight Georgia thanks for reporting foreign the final polls are in and the real clear politics averages give Republicans the edge in retaking not only the house but the Senate Trafalgar Group which is partnered with election wire and morning wire for polling results found Republican Senate candidates with a slight Edge in Pennsylvania Georgia and Nevada and sizable leads in Wisconsin and Ohio trafalgar's Robert kahali told morning wire that gauging voters sentiment is increasingly difficult because of submerged Republican voters who tend not to trust Legacy Media outlets and pollsters taking into account the submerged vote those Republicans who feel intimidated and refuse to take polls at all I think we're looking at all the signs of a red wave thanks for listening to morning wire we'll be back this afternoon with more of the news you need to know and starting at 4 pm Eastern today tune in to daily wires election coverage which will feature me and Georgia Cabot Phillips Megan Basham and other morning wire contributors the show will be streaming live at

    "VvcM0TH0DJg": "[Music] the holiday shopping season kicked off this past weekend with record numbers and sales following Black Friday much did people spend and did it live up to economists projections I'm Daley wire editor-in-chief John Bickley with Georgia Howe it's Monday November 28th and this is morning wire the Biden Administration is loosening its grip on Venezuelan sanctions and is being blasted by critics for the move we could easily be providing all of the energy that these countries need if we were drilling here at home what are the terms of the East sanctions and what reason is the administration giving for the controversial move and Disney's newest feature bombs big at the box office what drove the disappointing attendance and will it shape Disney's creative

and get our best deals of the year on all the gifts worth giving this year despite inflation driving costs higher than ever Black Friday sales set new record highs surprising economists and exceeding the projections set by cautious business owners here to discuss what we learned this Black Friday is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips so Kevin a big weekend for retailers what do we need to know well last we talked the big question was how inflation and the poor state of the economy was going to factor into this year's holiday shopping there were a number of concerning polls showing Americans on track to buy far fewer gifts this holiday season and refrain from Black Friday shopping because money was tight right but it appears those concerns were a bit overstated on Friday online sales alone exceeded 9.3 billion dollars which is not only up from last year but marks an all-time high in Black Friday spending now it is worth noting because of inflation the cost of virtually everything is at least 10 percent higher than last year so even though total spending on Black Friday is up about seven percent this year the actual amount of goods purchased is likely down okay but regardless this was a pleasant surprise to say the least you know to the inflation Point how has it impacted holiday shopping so far yeah make no mistake about it inflation still played a major role and you can tell in a few ways first we saw a 78 jump in the number of people using buy now pay later plans economists say that that's a sign folks might have less than savings for gifts than they did last year especially given that people typically only in the past use those types of plans for higher priced goods and this year they were used for a lot of lower priced Goods as well as those bigger ones it's also concerning because these sorts of payment plans do impact your credit score in a negative Manner and often include incredibly High interest rates for those who default so be careful we also saw a growing number of Americans resort to using credit cards for their Black Friday spending this year which again is concerning given the credit card debt is currently at an all-time high with Americans owing nearly a trillion dollars on that front all right what was the biggest change this Black Friday from last well the biggest shift was the continuation of a trend we've seen over the last few years and that's the move towards online shopping and it's interesting many did it on their phones this year a record 48 percent of online purchases took place on a mobile device last year it was 44 now we're still waiting for final numbers on in-person shopping totals but from what we've seen so far brick and mortar stores saw another drop in the number of customers this year which isn't all that surprising when you remember that in-store traffic was also down 28 last Black Friday so a trend that's been coming now for a few years it's also worth noting some stores are less worried about the trend because many are struggling to find workers right now with the tight labor market and their profit margins are actually higher when people shop online got it and on the consumer side customers are more accustomed to going online after covet lockdown so there's an increased Comfort level but also many businesses are intentionally offering their best deals online it's just a new age of Black Friday shopping yeah indeed it is so what were the most popular products sold what were people buying this year as you might imagine electronics and toys led the way this Black Friday on the electronics front the most popular items this year have been smart home devices and audio equipment like headphones and Bluetooth shoot speakers and for toys and games the best sellers were predominantly video games like FIFA 23 NBA 2k23 and Pokemon and fortnite games Pokemons still thing apparently so John sounds like there's at least some good news to kick off the holiday season Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Kevin Phillips coming up the Biden Administration eases sanctions on Venezuela sir [Music] inflation right now it's kind of a big deal you

regime in Venezuela on Saturday the U.S treasury eased sanctions and will allow california-based Chevron to pump oil in the South American country in return Venezuelan president Nicholas Maduro must commit 3 billion in unfrozen State assets to humanitarian programs here to talk about the bite administration's efforts to court the Maduro regime as daily wire reporter Tim Pierce Tim a lot of people are talking about the timing of this agreement in the middle of a global energy shortage but the bite Administration says gas prices don't have anything to do with this deal why that's right an anonymous Biden Administration official who briefed reporters on the sanctions agreement on Saturday said this deal was about restoring democracy in Venezuela the U.S treasury said in a statement that it's taking steps to normalize relations in the hopes that Maduro and the Venezuelan government will eventually restore free and fair elections okay so promoting democracy that's the administration's claim what are the critics saying well President Biden has recently tried to browbeat oil companies and to higher domestic energy production and blamed corporate Greed for high energy prices the White House is also seemingly walked back tough language on Saudi Arabia's human rights record and tried to get greater oil production out of OPEC critics see this agreement with Venezuela as just the latest attempt to increase Global energy supplies while keeping Biden's environmental agenda alive in the U.S Stephen Moore an economic advisor in the White House under former president Trump says that the agreement makes no sense given the United States vast energy supplies here's a bit of what he said on Fox News Sunday this is the same Administration well that won't allow us to do drilling here in the United States not in Texas not in Oklahoma not in Alaska not in West Virginia but we can pump oil from from Venezuela it makes absolutely no sense it's put America last energy policy well it's very simple the United States has more oil gas and coal than virtually any other country in the world by the way we also have well don't forget the the cleanest called the cleanest oil and gas in the world so if you're worried about the environment why would you want to get oil and gas from Venezuela which has some of the dirtiest energy and not from the United States so we have to become the energy Powerhouse that we were we have the capability of doing it or through some strong criticism there can Americans expect lower energy prices from this deal while the White House and Chevron say that's unlikely at least in the short term the administration stressed that the agreement is limited it approves Chevron to resume its partnership with Venezuela's state-owned oil company for six months during that time Chevron won't be able to expand its operations Beyond its current Holdings and all profits will go toward paying down chevron's debts so maduro's government shouldn't make any money off the agreement on top of that Chevron will have to cope with poor infrastructure and Corruption that just comes with conducting business in Venezuela right the company says it could take months or years to ramp up production to the point that Americans begin to feel relief at the pump all right so years to see if this pays off at all for Americans Tim thanks for joining us those daily wires Tim Pierce in the midst of a shake-up at the top Disney's animated division continues to struggle at the box office it's big budget Thanksgiving release Strange World earned only about 18 million dollars over the long Thanksgiving weekend a historically poor performance for the company here to explain why strange world may have flopped and what it means for Disney is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan Disney had another devastating debut the film earned about 18 million its opening weekend put that in context for us well you know the context is the company spent about 180 million on this movie and that was just on the production not including marketing costs now you also have to keep in mind the timing here we haven't seen any big new animated movies in theater since July and this movie released over the long five-day Thanksgiving weekend which you know is typically a pretty big movie going period for families so Disney was clearly expecting the audience to turn out because the film opened in more than 4 000 theaters and that's about the maximum reach you can get so there's really just zero way to spin this strange world is you have to say a flop of Epic Proportions right now estimates are it's going to lose about 100 million dollars okay so the obvious question is what happened well there's a lot of speculation about that out in the Hollywood trades many are pointing to the fact that wakanda forever is still going strong and maybe it's sucking up all the oxygen now on the other hand others are pointing to the fact that it's a Sci-Fi themed film and they're suggesting that maybe the crowd that shows up for the more traditional Disney Princess movies isn't that interested in a story about outer space but again that is a tough sell given that it was the only game in town for younger audiences in a time frame that typically plays very big with young families so I could see something of a middling performance in that case I don't see an outright disaster like this so what's your theory about why this flopped you know I'm looking at the content of the film and that is something that very few Legacy Outlets are pointing to as the explanation and I think the reason for that probably goes to political correctness as we know Disney promised early this year that they were going to work harder to include lgbtq characters in their story lines um and in their content generally light year for example featured a same-sex romance earlier in the summer and so now does strange world one of the film's main characters is a teen boy with a crush on another boy and that reportedly plays a prominent role in the story and was also celebrated pretty widely in a lot of media coverage leading up to the film's release so I think maybe parents annoyance with that seems to be showing up in the audience scores one parent review that exemplified quite a number of others on Rotten Tomatoes said this and I'm quoting if I want to teach my children about sex and or sexual preferences at seven or eight I would do it in my home I don't need a Disney movie to help me out with it so the phone has also been criticized for leaning into some other PC tropes to give you another example there's some toxic masculinity and the central conflict of the film is a pretty overt Parable against the use of fossil fuels and then on top of that some critics have said that the writing is just weaker than the typical Disney production so right now it's got a B rating from audiences on Cinema score and if that holds Strange World will actually become the first animated Disney movie to score below the a range ever so you can't help but look at that and put it into the context of light year a movie that was supposed to be huge for Disney owned Pixar in that case Lightyear also had the advantage of being part of the most profitable franchise in Pixar's history Toy Story and it released in a typically big time frame for families early summer so it also like Strange World had some pretty positive critical reviews they weren't the best but they weren't bad but again a lot of publicity surrounded a lesbian kiss in that film and whether that was the reason it didn't do well is hard to pin down but what we do know is that audiences stayed away well it'll be interesting to see how Disney reacts to this audience feedback Megan

Musk continues to generate headlines With The Changes he's making at Twitter perhaps his biggest announcement yet was reinstating president Trump's account on Saturday here to tell us more about the latest changes at Twitter including the return of President Trump to the platform his daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan this isn't exactly a surprise but it's still a major development right it is so Twitter had banned Trump in the aftermath of the January 6 Capital riots as we'll all remember but in the run-up to taking over the platform Elon Musk had called that a mistake and so by the way did Twitter's former Chief Executive and founder Jack Dorsey even though he was ultimately the one who made the decision to de-platform Trump in the first place so it isn't really surprising that musk ultimately decided to allow Trump back onto the app but he did take some time to prepare people so on November 2nd after he officially took over he tweeted that he wouldn't be reinstating any banned or suspended accounts for a few weeks once the company had what he called a clear process for doing so and then we saw him roll that out in stages over a couple of days on Friday musk announced that both Jordan Peterson and the Babylon bee had been reinstated both of those accounts had been suspended for tweets that fell afoul of transgender activists and that evening musk posted a poll asking Twitter users if Trump should be reinstated well 15 million people voted and a slim majority said that he should that was good enough for musk and Trump's account was reinstated by Saturday night so has Trump started tweeting again yet not yet and whether he's going to want to is still a big question as Trump is in something of a catch-22 when it comes to Twitter so on the one hand the platform was unquestionably one of his greatest weapons in building a political Coalition before the 2016 election and now that he's announced that he's seeking the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential election he's probably going to want to return to his most effective bully pulpit but on the other hand he is deeply invested in his own new social media platform truth social and any return to Twitter could suggest that maybe he realizes that that platform can't compete with Twitter in terms of reach and influence for now Trump seems to be choosing his business interests over his political interests when someone asked him Saturday night about being reinstated on Twitter he replied and I'll quote Twitter has a lot of problems it may make it it may not make it well it has sounded like Twitter is in a pretty precarious situation lately over the weekend we saw some reports that a huge majority of the staff have resigned what do we know for sure you know I think it's safe to say that rumors of Twitter's demise have been pretty premature essentially what happened is that last week musk gave an ultimatum to those employees who weren't laid off that they should commit to working quoting extremely hardcore or leave well some Engineers as well as employees and finance user safety and a few other key areas apparently weren't willing to commit to extremely hardcore work and they did resign right now Twitter is actually operating with about 33 percent of the staff it had when musk took over and this led to a lot of fretting online over the weekend about whether Twitter would crash or get hacked CBS News was among them they announced on Friday evening that they would be suspending any activity on their Twitter account out of what they called an abundance of caution over security concerns but that concern lasted less than two days by Sunday the account was active again and again despite a drastically reduced staff there have been no signs of operational or security problems yet in fact in some ways Twitter seems to be making some significant breakthroughs in the last couple of weeks that could actually reassure advertisers that it's a good place to invest their money to give you just one small but important example the well-known child exploitation activist Eliza blue has been pushing Twitter for years to police child pornography more aggressively and she says she's already seen evidence that musk has made key changes that are working one thing she pointed out thanks to beefed up Community reporting systems the three biggest hashtags used by child abusers selling child sexual abuse material on Twitter have been virtually eliminated that's what she was reporting so we'll see if those kind of improvements continue well that would be big news Megan thanks for reporting my pleasure that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham coming up the House GOP announces investigations into the bidens and an

visit karzing.com wire today to skip the guesswork and find the best deals near you that's carzing.com wire Republican lawmakers are preparing investigations into potential corruption within the Biden Administration after the GOP won a slim house majority in the midterms one of the main focuses of the investigation will be the president's involvement in his family's foreign business dealings here to talk about the gop's priorities when they take control of key house committees as daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim who can expect to subpoena first from this new Republican majority in the house not Joe Biden ironically Congressman Jim Comer is the top Republican on the house oversight committee and will likely be its next chairman he wants to investigate Biden's role in his family's foreign business deals which were largely struck by Biden's son Hunter and brother James Comer said last week that Hunter is already in the crosshairs President Biden though is not subpoenaing a sitting president would start battles over executive privilege that Comer doesn't want to fight right now but Comer says the investigation needs to go forward in the interest of U.S national security South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy mace sits on the oversight committee aside from the president she says the committee is open-minded about potential targets I think anybody is on the table right now I would love to see the FBI come into the oversight committee or Judiciary and tell us why they told media to bury the story that's a start I would like to see some of Hunter Biden's business partners come in and talk about the big guy and his involvement what did it mean when they gave keys to the office to Joe Biden and others including folks aligned with the Communist Party of China what other investigations are Republicans working on Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan is expected to chair the Judiciary Committee next year he has his own plans for investigations which will in part focus on the suppression of stories about Hunter Biden's laptop prior to the 2020 election we're going to try to help representative Comer and the team here at oversight with uh with our work on Judiciary but with the specific focus on what the FBI was doing a colleague of mine says when is the FBI going to quit interfering with elections 2016 they spied on President Trump's campaign 2018 it was the Mueller investigation 2020 they suppressed information about the hunter Biden story 2022 they rented the president's home 91 days before the election all right so how will the White House and Democrats fight this what can they do about these investigations well as the minority party there's limited action they can take from inside Congress it looks like Democrats will most rely on outside Democratic groups such as the Congressional Integrity project and facts first USA both of those groups and others are funded by Democrat donors to serve as attack dogs for the party the Congressional Integrity project was dormant for the first two years of Biden's presidency but Democratic operatives plan to resurrect it to as CIP executive director Kyle Herrick put it investigate the investigators they'll fight back against Republican investigations by conducting opposition Research into the lawmakers themselves but we'll see if any Republicans are intimidated by that Tim thanks for reporting that was daily wires Tim Pierce [Music] Christians new information is shining a light on how Americans voted by gender race and age and were each party picked up and lost support here to discuss is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot we're starting to get a better idea of what happened on Election Day tell us what we've learned about voting trends well a number of large Outlets conducted massive exit surveys on Election Day profiling tens of thousands of Americans about who they voted for and why and it's giving us a better idea of how Democrats were able to pull off that surprisingly strong showing for example the Associated Press surveyed 115 000 registered voters and the results were fascinating so let's start with Republicans where do they perform best first off Suburban white women who looked like they were becoming a solid blue voting block after going for Democrats by four and then five points the last two cycles swung back for Republicans on election day by a seven point margin that is very important moving forward from an electoral standpoint right another positive sign that really surprised a lot of people was Republican performance with black voters especially younger ones in 2020 black voters aged 18 to 44 went for Democrats by a 76 Point margin this year it was cut down to a 54 Point margin all right so more than a 20-point drop off there yeah now Republicans got 23 this cycle which it doesn't sound great on its face but that's more than double what they've seen the last two cycles and definitely a positive trend that bodes well we also saw a 10-point swing towards Republicans among Hispanic voters as well with Republicans pulling in 41 and finally from a population standpoint Republicans once again dominated in less densely populated more rural districts across the country they won 92 percent of rural House Seats now not surprisingly Democrats have the same kind of success in more densely populated urban areas they won 92 percent of those seats so it really is the country versus the city there now let's get to the Democrats Beyond urban areas where did they have the most success even though turnout among gen Z and Millennials was surprisingly low in early voting on Election Day over a quarter of 18 to 29 year olds showed up that is the second highest youth turnout for any midterm on record that's according to Tufts University and according to exit polls Democrats won that demographic by a 28 point margin no other age group saw more than a 12 point margin among the parties all right so young people really turned out for Democrats they did and they really could have saved some races for the Democrat Party now another interesting nugget in the data is how voters swung based on their own economic situation so among those who say that they're better off now than they were two years ago Democrats held a 75 to 23 Advantage they also got 73 percent of Voters who said that their economic situation was about the same as 2020. but among the roughly 50 percent of Americans who say their situation was worse off this year Republicans dominated 79 to 19. there was also an interesting breakdown between married versus unmarried voters tell us about that yeah so this one was fascinating according to a CNN exit poll of almost 20 000 voters the GOP won married women by 14 points they won married men by 20 points and Republicans also won among unmarried Men by seven points but get this among unmarried women Democrats won by 37 points 7 in 10 unmarried women went for Democrats on Election Day so more than enough to offset the Republican Advantage among married voters fascinating and potentially game-changing stuff there Cabot thanks for reporting that's daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips we're tracking this

supporting veterans and America's coffee the hit western series Yellowstone returned for its fifth season with record-breaking ratings this marks its second season as the most popular series on television daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham joins us now to put Yellowstone's success in the context of The Wider entertainment landscape so Megan I couldn't really get into Yellowstone but apparently it's crushing even Breaking Bad at its peak is that true it is true I know it's crazy so the show which airs on the Paramount Network actually Drew more than 12 million viewers last Sunday night and that makes it the top scripted series premiere of the year but what's really important to note is just how much the show's audience has grown so it was up overall with audiences of all ages and that's impressive enough given that it was already doing pretty well with older viewers but what's really amazing is how it scored with Advertiser coveted young adults because you don't really imagine a show about a Montana ranching family starring 67 year old Kevin Costner necessarily drawing a lot of younger viewers well it's up 52 percent with that 18 to 34 year old demo now is this part of a growing Trend in viewership overall in TV or is Yellowstone outperforming all of its peers right now yeah I think you have to say that Yellowstone is outperforming in fact the context here is that the rest of the small screen world has really been struggling so Netflix has had to completely revamp its business model and it's gone through two rounds of layoffs in part because audiences just weren't tuning in for its original series and then you have Disney which has seen the popularity of its Star Wars and Marvel series Wayne it's now announcing layoffs as well meanwhile Amazon notoriously did not score the hit at hope to with rings of power and while the Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon has done very well for HBO Yellowstone's numbers even beat the dragon by a couple of million so compared to the rest of the television landscape which has been fracturing and pulling in more and more Niche audiences Yellowstone success is pretty stunning and by the way one more note it's doing all of that without having that all-important intellectual property what that means is it's not based on some other novel or comic book or movie that already had a built-in fan base with 100 original now I didn't watch enough to find out but why is it so popular but you know I think there's some obvious and uncontroversial reasons it's got that same kind of soapy appeal that Dallas did which was the big hot Western show of the 1980s the Montana backdrops are just gorgeous and while I would personally say that some of the performances are uneven Kevin Costner is an Oscar winner the show hinges on him his performance is outstanding on the controversial side though there's also been a lot of discussion about how the show hits with republican-leaning audiences who rarely feel that their tastes are served by big Hollywood Productions so on the conservative side of that commentary you have the New York Times columnist Ross douthit who has called Yellowstone the most Red State show on television his liberal colleague tracia McMillan caught him sort of echoed that idea but she couched it in much more negative terms she called the series an homage to the idea of white America's Last Stand and she went on to say and I'm just going to quote her words this show in post-trump America the political backdrop of white grievance and white Reclamation that we are undergoing trying to claw back to a sort of mythical 40 50 years ago when our systems worked better for white Americans than they did for non-white Americans so pretty spicy and a fairly common view among left-leaning entertainment media but frankly there are some hard numbers to back that political hypothesis up viewers in states with Republican Governors watch Yellowstone at three times the rate of States led by democrats and typically successful Series start out by being popular in urban centers and then spreading out to the rest of America Yellowstone has had the opposite trajectory it first found its audience in smaller towns like Abilene Texas Boise Idaho Lexington Kentucky and then it spread out from there all right well I live in Tennessee so maybe this is the show for me Megan thanks

faces another race-based controversy here to tell us more is Crane and Company co-host David Cohn all right David there is a lot of chaos surrounding this FTX situation and both financial and political implications but there's also a sports angle what is the latest on the sports front as it relates to this crypto collapse yes it's been a bit of a mess in the Sports World and one stadium is even getting renamed so following the announcement that FTX was filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy the first Domino default was in the NBA when the Miami Heat announced they plan to terminate their relationship with the cryptocurrency trading company in May 2021 when FTX had not even been in existence for three years the company signed a 19-year 135 million dollar contract to secure the naming rights for Miami's Arena which was then named FTX Arena now after only 526 days the heat are looking for a new naming rights partner that was a quick collapse and that's not the only consequence right yes many professional athletes are also caught up in this situation a class action lawsuit has been filed against FTX founder Sam bankman freed and the suit also names NFL Quarterback Tom Brady his now ex-wife Giselle Bundchen in NBA standout Steph Curry former NBA standout Shaquille O'Neal former MLB star David Ortiz Angels All-Star shohei Otani the U.S Open winner Naomi Osaka and that's just some of the big names the suit describes these well-known figures as parties who either controlled promoted assisted in and actively participated in FTX trading and the lawsuit also claims that consumers suffered over 11 billion dollars in Damages it's a mess indeed so as you noted the NFL plays into this FTX situation there was also some other big news in the league recently a notable coaching shake-up and it has some racial controversy there what can you tell us about that yes this all revolves around former All-Pro offensive lineman Jeff Saturday he was hired as the Indianapolis Colts interim head coach and he made his debut for the Colts against the Las Vegas Raiders two weeks ago Saturday's hiring came as former head coach Frank Wright was fired following a three five and one start to the season now many people were caught off guard by Colts owner Jim irsay hiring Jeff Saturday due to his lack of head coaching experience former coaches and players such as Bill Cower and Joe Thomas called the higher disrespectful to other coaches around the country while some media personalities criticized racial aspects of the higher saying no former black players would receive such an opportunity now supporters of Jeff Saturday myself included have pointed out that he was hired on an interim basis not the permanent full-time position with no indication that he would be the full-time head coach and he did win a Super Bowl with the franchise plus made six Pro bowls as a member of the Colt franchise all right so he has some credentials to really back up the interim hiring certainly well David thanks for coming on thank you that was sports writer and crane and Company co-host David Cohn [Music] as governments around the world push for a transition to electric vehicles startups are attempting to mass produce new kinds of batteries to lower costs and cut out Chinese Supply chains here with the details is daily wire's Michael Whitaker Michael thanks for coming on thanks for having me so the Biden Administration as well as leaders around the world are trying to make this transition to EVS as part of their plans for a carbon neutral economy but there have been a lot of stumbling blocks tell us about that as of now electric vehicles are very expensive the Lithium-ion batteries that run the car cost anywhere from ten to twelve thousand dollars and a new electric car costs around sixty four thousand dollars for reference the average new car costs about forty eight thousand dollars and that's still one of the most expensive things the average American buys the materials used to make most DB batteries lithium Cobalt manganese and nickel have become much more expensive over the last few years supply chain issues have not helped another issue is the environmental impact of Mining and Manufacturing these materials some estimates suggest that the cost to the environment offsets the benefit of switching from gas vehicles with many studies suggesting that the greenest option is actually to buy a used car rather than spring for a new EV although that is a contested literature different studies will give you different findings strategically over 80 percent of all Lithium-ion batteries in the world were manufactured in China in the last year China has about seven percent of the world's lithium reserves while South America has over half but according to a uk-based consultancy called Benchmark mineral intelligence China currently has 75 percent of the world's Cobalt refining capacity and about 59 percent of its lithium processing capacity the Us and other nations are building more factories of their own but that will take years and it could be decades before our production capacity matches China's if EV is another battery Reliant renewable energy Tech is going to become a key component of our economy in the near term that could give China a lot of Leverage over the United States now as John mentioned at the top some Engineers are trying to find workarounds tell us about that essentially they're trying to find new chemical combinations to make batteries from cheaper and more plentiful materials like sodium and sulfur sodium is fairly common and is a key ingredient in the very familiar table salt sodium chloride sulfur is found in many living organisms and is a key component of life it's often used in fertilizers it's also fairly well known for the characteristic rotten egg smell it can produce in the form of hydrogen sulfide right now some forms of such batteries do exist although they generally store less energy than their more expensive counterparts sodium ion batteries would bypass the most expensive components of traditional batteries entirely lithium sulfur batteries would still need some lithium as the name suggests albeit in smaller amounts than the traditional ones but they wouldn't need Cobalt or manganese to function according to prabhakra patil a former algae chem executive sodium ion batteries do have a place particularly for low end vehicles in the more cost-sensitive markets such as China India Africa and South America whereas the lithium sulfur batteries will be more expensive in the short term but in the long term those batteries could end up being the cheapest so are we likely to see automakers Embrace these new batteries anytime soon maybe but the new variants have issues of their own sulfur is very corrosive so it tends to wear down the battery fairly quickly within about 30 charges and sodium ion batteries are not as energy dense as conventional batteries so they don't have the same capacity which is pretty important if you're making long Journeys For example some firms are reportedly experimenting with treatments for the sulfur materials that could keep a battery operational throughout an ev's Lifetime and there is widespread interest in sodium Tech catl a Chinese company that produces about 30 of the world's lithium ion batteries has announced plans to produce sodium ion batteries by 2025. various companies in America and Europe many of them receiving millions of dollars in government subsidies are attempting to make a breakthrough and if they succeed the hope is that these new batteries will make EVS more affordable and more environmentally friendly great and make us less dependent on China Michael thanks for reporting thanks for having me

video of newly reinstalled Disney CEO Bob Iger addressing employees about the company's political activism has sparked debate both among the public and within the company here to explain what Iger said in the town hall and how staffers inside Disney are responding to it is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan it feels like we've been here before how is the public responding to this latest leaked video well you know in this town hall Iger was asked in a couple of different ways about the growing perception that Disney has become a politically activist company and he responded by saying that he thinks some issues that are branded as political are really just being a good citizen of the world that's how he put it he did not say he was referring to LGBT content but that was the inference that a lot of people took from it however Iger also said that it's a mistake for Disney to get into a battle with the state of Florida over its parental rights and education law and he said the company needs to listen to its audience and have respect for the people that it's serving and then to sum it all up Iger said this it's important to have respect for the people that you're serving that you're trying to reach and not have disdain for it that said we're not going to make everybody happy all the time and we're not going to try to and we're certainly not going to lessen our core values in order to make everybody happy all the time now it was conservative journalist Chris Ruffo who first obtained this video and he said this indicates that Iger is trying to moderate the company's position and move Disney toward neutrality or at least he's trying to signal that that's what he's doing basically rufo argued that the town hall might be proof that conservatives are finding some success in those efforts to check Disney's leftward trajectory but has that held those inside the company see it you know I hope to a number of people kind of up and down the Disney ranks this week and some of them have worked pretty closely with Iger and what I'll say is that while they're not necessarily disagreeing with rufo they also think he may be reading a little much into the tea leaves here one told me for example Iger is such a master politician that pretty much everyone at Disney was initially pleased with his comments but then realized he didn't say much either way and so to that point I've been told that left-wing activists at Disney walked out of that town hall meeting really feeling that Iger reaffirmed the company's commitment to promote their causes however by the end of the day employees in the LGBT Pride slack Channel were broadly hypothesizing that Disney allowed its latest animated feature Strange World to bomb on purpose essentially their theory was that Executives didn't put much marketing muscle behind it because its failures give them an excuse not to Center more films on LGBT characters so that is not to say that there's any Merit to that speculation I only pointed out to say this is where the discourse within Disney is right now and what about those further up the ranks with a better personal sense of what Iger intends here well when does one described him as a Bill Clinton figure which I thought was pretty interesting he said he's likely to Pivot if there's demonstrable proof that that's what the customer is demanding and this person also suggested that as a known Democratic donor Iger has the progressive street cred that previous CEO Bob chapek didn't have and that that could allow him to pull Disney back from this politicized content without getting the same blowback that chapik saw from left-wing employees and media outlets now that said he's not convinced that Iger will change course so we'll have to keep watching to see what Iger does more than what he says thanks Megan that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham coming up San Francisco launches a universal basic income program for gender

hundred dollars a month for 18 months here to discuss the program is daily wire reporter Amanda prestigmo hey Amanda so there's a lot of controversy about this program tell us a little bit about it hi Georgia sure so the guaranteed income for Trans people program dubbed gift was created in partnership with Lion Martin Community Health Services and the transgender District it's basically a Ubi or Universal basic income program that will offer no strings attached cash to about 55 people what makes the program unique is that only transgender or so-called gender non-conforming individuals are eligible to get the money another criteria is that they must earn less than six hundred dollars per month now gender non-conforming is a somewhat broad category is there going to be a process in place to verify whether recipients are actually living as the opposite gender or have a history of living as the opposite gender that's unclear at this point daily wire reached out to the mayor's office specifically about that question and we haven't received a response yet but it is a legitimate question on the application page for example there's a drop down of about 90 different eligible gender options including one titled not specified as a catch-all other options include things like two-spirit brother boy stud Omni gender Femme Butch aggressive gray gender and so on so the question of how to verify is very relevant now aside from the trans angle Universal basic income programs are popping up in a variety of places what's the argument for sending out cash to citizens right so UBI has been tossed around in Progressive circles for a while one of the most notable proponents of Ubi is Andrew Yang he ran for president as a democrat in 2020 and Ubi was part of his platform Yang said he would give every American over 18 years old a thousand dollars a month if he were elected president but in his plan there were no racial or gender requirements other proponents say that giving people free money makes them more productive because they have time to pursue enriching Endeavors like entrepreneurship or higher education a variety of small-scale Ubi pilot programs popped up in Progressive cities during the pandemic but the results were mixed now we've reported before on this show that most of these Ubi pilot programs were eventually abandoned what are the downsides of Ubi yeah I mean as usual it all comes down to where this money is coming from with government-funded Ubi programs the obvious criticism is that we're just printing money without any economic output creating inflation we sort of got a taste of this with stimulus packages during the pandemic critics also say that this kind of program just ingrains more dependence on the government and undermines productivity so when will the gift program get started applications right now are being accepted until December 15th and then 55 people will be selected these people will have to maintain an income below 600 a month and they must continue to maintain a transgender or so-called gender non-conforming identity throughout the program all right well more interesting ideas coming out of San Francisco Amanda thanks for reporting yeah my pleasure that was daily wire reporter Amanda prestigmo [Music] power of app markets including Apple's App Store and Google Play has come under more public scrutiny in recent days after Elon Musk claims that Apple was threatening to remove Twitter from its App Store now new legislation that would directly impact such a situation is making its way through the Senate joining us to discuss is Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee a sponsor of the open app markets act so Senator your big Tech bill as bipartisan support in the Senate and has gotten some more attention amid these headlines about Twitter and apple musk now says that the crisis has been averted after he met with Tim Cook but how would this bill operate in that kind of a situation able to go actually to Twitter and they would be able to put that app on their phone right now they have to go through the apple or the Google store that means that you are having to do business with Apple or Google well you know it appears that Apple has decided they're not very fond of Twitter now that Elon Musk is in charge now that means that people would have to side load there's a process called side loading so they would have to then search out Twitter and then be able to go through the process of getting that app from Twitter and putting it on their phone in a side load capacity and for now at least that doesn't seem like it's going to be necessary but this act is ultimately about gatekeeping and monopolistic practices have you heard from constituents that they really wanted something like this this kind of protection in Tennessee we have so many app developers and the reason I actually started moving forward with the open app market Act is because of the innovators that we have that want to work directly with the people that are going to use their service their app and many times you have Banks you have Hospital companies you have medical practices you have service organizations that would like to work directly with people and not have to go through the App Store so yes indeed we are hearing quite a bit about this because innovators are tired of having to pay 30 percent of whatever they make to Apple now another recent headline involving musk and Twitter involves the European Union which is threatening to ban Twitter over content moderation policies will this bill cross the borders of the U.S will it impact the app environment internationally when you talk about the EU the UK New Zealand Australia they're always watching what steps we take in online governance with the Online Marketplace they're very concerned about safety security kids online safety act they've been very watchful of that our online consumer privacy they've been very watchful of that so what you may see is when we take an action they may end up repeating a very similar action for their individuals indeed Canada this year has increased and the EU has increased some of their online privacy protections so America is really leading the way there Senator thanks for joining us thank you that was Senator Marsha Blackburn [Music] this week on Thursday the Supreme Court agreed to take up

    "7YWgZA_rIuQ": "[Music] three weeks until election day and deep blue organ is poised to potentially elect its first Republican governor in 40 years we look at the surprising race and the three candidates vying for the key role I'm daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley with Georgia Howe it's Monday October 17th and this is morning wire [Music] the doj has pressed charges against 11 activists in Tennessee saying the group blocked the entrance to an abortion clinic we were singing in a reading scripture praying for folks what are the protesters saying and why is the case getting

shows that one reliably Blue State could elect a republican governor for the first time in four decades here to discuss the race and the Republican looking to make history in Oregon as daily wire senior editor Kevin Phillips Cabot the idea of a state like Oregon turning red seems far-fetched but it's looking like a real possibility tell us about it well you're absolutely right it has been 40 years since Oregon has had a republican Governor that's the longest drought of any state in the country but that could all change this year as Republican Christine Drazen States former minority leader in the house has a serious shot to break the Republican losing streak right now we don't have a ton of data to go on but every poll that we've seen since late June has risen in the lead with around 35 to 39 percent of the vote now that might not sound like enough to be in the lead but because there are three serious candidates on the ballot the winner likely will only need around 40 percent of the vote to win right organ has a unique Dynamic with this three-way race tell us more about that so typically third-party candidates only pull a few points here there but don't end up being major factors in the race but that is not the case in Oregon in addition to Democrat Tina kotek who's pulling around 32 percent in most polls you've also got independent Betsy Johnson on the ballot and she's bringing in about 20 right now and she's also it's worth pointing out out fundraised both candidates so something that you almost never see from a third party now while Johnson has attacked Democrats as wanting to make Oregon quote woke and broke she did spend nearly 20 years as a Democrat herself and is definitely performing better with liberal voters and that's a huge Advantage for Republicans who are really benefiting right now from the vote being split what's driving the momentum for the Republican prison well unlike other states where Republican candidates have found success focusing on the economy and inflation in Oregon the main issue has been homelessness and crime according to a recent poll from The Oregonian one in three voters there say that homelessness is the largest issue facing in the state while crime came in second with one in six voters listing that as their top issue and that has really benefited the Republican Drazen who promised to declare a Statewide state of emergency to address homelessness and who unlike other candidates has actually touted her support from law enforcement and said that she'll refund the police which is noteworthy in a state that had really leaned into the defund the police movement for example here's a recent ad in support of Drazen Christine Drazen is a bold new leader who's endorsed by law enforcement Grayson's road map for Oregon declares a Statewide homeless emergency expands treatment and services Works to make meth and heroin a crime again and fully funds police so as you can hear not the kind of message that you typically expect to hear working in a state like Oregon but it really shows the discontent from a lot of Voters there as the state has struggled over the last two years especially with homelessness and it's also worth pointing out the state's current governor democrat Kate Brown consistently polls as one of if not the most unpopular governors in the country with a disapproval rating in the mid 50s so that is certainly dragging down the Democrats as well yeah I'm sure now this race got some additional attention over the last few weeks after an unexpected donor stepped into the mix correct that is putting it lightly Nike co-founder Phil Knight made a million dollar donation to The Republican Christine Drazen this was especially noteworthy because Knight isn't exactly a traditional Republican donor he actually donated 2.5 million dollars to the independent Betsy Johnson earlier in the campaign but this new donation is important because it does seem to indicate that Knight believes that Drazen is going to win or at least has a really good shot and a number of outside observers say that night's donation is less about political ideology and more about the fact that he wants to end up backing the winning horse given that Nike's headquarters are based in Oregon but regardless a fascinating turn and yet another sign that Republicans appear poised to have a surprisingly strong performance in deep blue Oregon it definitely seems that way Cabot thanks for reporting that's daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips and we should note that Cabot and I addressed this race and other key Governor's races in the latest episode of election wire for those who haven't checked it out yet election wire is up on the morning wire feed and daily wires YouTube channel [Music] the FBI has indicted 11 pro-life protesters in Tennessee for allegedly violating the freedom of access to Clinic entrances act the charges have riled conservatives who say the Department of Justice has been weaponized against pro-lifers after the overturning of Roe v Wade here to discuss the charges is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim what is the justice department accusing these activists of doing hey Georgia the doj has charged 11 people with obstructing or conspiring to obstruct access to an abortion clinic in Mount Juliet Tennessee a group of pro-life protesters in March of last year gathered on a hallway leading to the care from Health Center a clinic located on the second floor of a medical office building video shows members of the group refusing to make way for members of the clinic staff and refusing multiple requests by police officers to take the protest outside at one point a police officer trying to escort a woman into the clinic shoved aside a couple protesters before the woman eventually left morning when I spoke to Paul Vaughn about the incident he is one of the activists charged by the doj here's how he described what happened somebody came a patient came up in the elevator anyway he was trying to force you know push through the crowd and stuff and he came in shoving and pushing and uh we that's on video on the video they're circulating out there where he shoves two of the pro-lifers against the wall and uh that's the only two actually the one lady that came down the hall got convicted she's like this is way too much trouble I don't want to you know whatever and uh and she didn't even get close she didn't try to come to the door she just turned around and and walked off with one of uh one of the pro-lifers talking to her now what is the face act and what kind of penalties are these protesters facing face stands for freedom of access to Clinic entrances and the ACT prohibits any kind of obstruction or intimidation techniques that inhibit patients from accessing reproductive health care clinics or parishioners from entering places of worship so basically it protects abortion clinics and places of worship it also protects against vandalism of these same institutions if convicted the seven accused of conspiracy face a Max sentence of 11 years in prison three years of supervised release and up to 350 000 in fines the five others who face just charges of obstruction face up to a year in prison one year of supervised release and up to ten thousand dollars in fines now the activists don't deny that they were congregating in the hallway and that police were needed to escort a patient past them what are they saying about the situation yeah some defendants and their supporters address the charges in a press conference from the steps of the federal courthouse in Nashville last week the speaker suggested that the charges are being selectively leveled against pro-life protesters and not against those who vandalize pregnancy centers for political reasons and they generally characterize their situation as a struggle of good against evil among the arrested is Eva edel she's 87 years old and a survivor of a Soviet labor camp she's been protesting against abortion for decades and has been arrested dozens of times for allegedly block hating abortion clinics in the 80s and 90s here's what she had to say last week I was 9 years old when I was shipped in a cattle car to be starved to death in a concentration camp in Yugoslavia oh I wish that people would have gathered at the entrance of my camp to plead for our lives even at the risk of their own freedom state Senator Mark potty referenced a spiritual battle going on in the U.S and contrasted the treatment of the pro-lifers to that of riders and looters last year just last year there were riots just a few blocks from here breaking in buildings looting and they didn't have the same law enforcement against them as what happened as a peaceful rally in Mount Juliet so it sounds like they feel there's an unequal application of Justice right all right well Tim we're going to continue to monitor this thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wire's Tim Pierce yeah in a nearly two-hour speech in front of more than 2 000 delegates Chinese president Xi Jinping called for a ramp up of military development signaled that China would use Force to take over Taiwan if necessary and double down on the country's zero coveted policies now John you spoke to Gordon Chang he's a columnist and author of The Coming collapse of China you spoke to him about ji's speech and his appointment to a third term in leadership which is a break in precedent first how significant is it that she has been appointed to a third term as general secretary for the party well this is historic if he's reappointed as expected it's also important to note the context here China's government removed term limits for the presidency back in 2018 which allowed G to potentially be president for life so we're witnessing the consolidation of Power by XI on multiple fronts as you noted the Communist Party he controls has been tightening its grip on the country over the last decade this speech Sunday appears to have been designed to underscore that point in many ways XI is officially the most powerful leader of China since Chairman Mao and his government is really starting to mirror Mao's regime in its iron grip on the country right well and a good example of that that we've covered quite a bit on this show is ji's approach to covid right perhaps the most Draconian in the world in fact dozens of Chinese cities have implemented extreme lockdown measures just in the last two months and they've done so based on very small numbers of cases often just a handful the result has been devastating economically despite that and and pleas from citizens who are being crushed by these lockdowns she made clear in his speech Sunday that he was going to keep imposing these strict measures it's an American media from this speech was G's focus on the military what did we learn there well in short we learned that she is committed to ramping up the military and taking control of Taiwan in the speech he called for an increase in military development which of course comes as tensions between China and the U.S have been really escalating over China's more aggressive militaristic approach what was particularly notable Sunday is that XI spoke early on about Taiwan seeming to emphasize its importance to his regime at one point he said that China will never commit to abandoning the use of force and control of Taiwan we asked Gordon Chang about whether those comments could mean there's a new sense of urgency about the situation here's what he said his language especially in the latter part of the work report does suggest a new urgency but really we've known Siegen ping has believed that during his tenure China must absorb Taiwan so in a sense although there are some rhetorical nods here I don't think there's really been any change in his attitude Chang also went on to outline she's extremely aggressive Ambitions for China jinping's vision is first of all taking Taiwan taking parts of India breaking apart Japan and the Philippines taking territory under the control of others also controlling the Global Commons he believes for instance that the South China Sea which is International Water belongs to China blue National soil is the phrase that Chinese officials use these days and they actually even talk about tiencia or all under heaven in other words The View that China is the only legitimate ruler of planet Earth and since 2018 Chinese officials have actually been talking about the moon and Mars as Sovereign Chinese territory so there's never been a more ambitious ruler in history so what we have here is Xi using the platform of this major national speech to signal that China is moving full steam ahead toward a more aggressive military Nation now we've also seen an increasing number of reports about China's Financial struggles did g address anything about that actually not really so according to Chang and many others China isn't a true debt crisis most notably when it comes to plunging property prices which has been caused by these large developers that have been defaulting on loans but G conspicuously did not address these issues of collapsing property prices he also failed to talk about another major issue significant youth unemployment that's been plaguing China as well so Chang said that those notable omissions really show that the Communist party has no solutions to these core economic problems the country's facing well a historic and very significant speech indeed we'll see how much this impacts the U.S and China's relations going forward foreign we're tracking this week the Biden Administration has now opened applications for the president's so-called student loan forgiveness program through its beta mode website the website is set to be fully active by the end of the month the non-partisan CBO estimates that the program will cost taxpayers around 400 billion dollars thanks for waking up with us we'll be back this afternoon with more of the news you need to know thank you",
    "G2maJ2FgAps": "[Music] inflation rose again in September at a higher rate than expected I think the reality is that December could see another 75 basis points depending on what next month's CPI says the Wall Street Economist breaks down the numbers and what it means for Americans I'm Georgia Howe with daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley it's Thursday October 13th and this is morning wire the Biden Administration is spearheading a diversity equity and inclusion initiative at the government level that it hopes will become a model for the rest of the nation what's in the plan and what's the long-term goal and new evidence reveals that the White House and Homeland Security knew that border agents did not whip migrants at the border they withheld facts and anytime that you withhold facts from the American people you should be willing to step down from your job better men would step down we speak to the man who uncovered the evidence thanks for waking up with morning wire stay tuned we have the news you need to know thank you you buy homeowners insurance to protect your house and auto insurance to protect your car but what measures have you taken to protect the future of your children start with Will from epic will a will gives you the power to decide who will raise your kids or something happened to you and your spouse without one the state decides it only costs 119 dollars for a single person to create a will and when you use promo code wire you'll save 10 go to epicwill.com and use promo code wired to save 10 on Epic Will's complete will package that's epicwill.com promo code wire [Music] the labor department released new inflation numbers Wednesday and it's bad news for the economy inflation remained higher than economists had predicted we talked with Kenny polkari founder and CEO of case Capital Advisors to discuss the data and what it could mean going forward so Kenny we got the new numbers inflation Rose a total of 8.5 percent in the producer price index Rose 0.4 percent last month that's higher than economists were expecting correct yep it was higher than the estimate but it is lower than last month so they're going to play on that that it was lower than last month but the fact is it was higher than the estimate and the month over month number was higher than the estimate and higher than last month which suggests that inflation is not responding at the moment the FED has been raising rates really aggressively more aggressively than we've seen in decades why isn't the economy slowing listen that's a long conversation but you have to remember that the FED started stimulating during the great financial crisis which started in 2000 and really eight by the time they started stimulating and they never stopped they stimulated for 13 years now they should have stopped in between somewhere around 2015 2016 they should have started the pullback but they did not and then covet hit they kept rates at zero they kept stimulating and then when the signal came in April of 2021 when CPI shot from 1.6 to 3.1 in one month clearly up and through their two percent Target that they've told everybody was the number they refused to see it in April of 2021 and they continued to stimulate through the end of the year even in the face of rising inflation every month from April we saw inflation go up go up go up and they kept telling us don't worry don't worry don't worry it's true story we got it it's all good they stimulated right till 2022 and then they recognized uh this isn't what we thought and maybe it's not as transitory and so now we are backed into a position where inflation is now at 40-year highs and they're going to have to get more aggressive but look they stimulated for so long it's going to take time for this to pull back and don't forget Energy prices just went up 22 in the month of October so next month's PPI and CPI is going to be even stronger quite honestly they should have raised rates a full percentage Point probably three meetings ago but uh inflation is not responding because they waited too long what do you see coming next including from the federal government the the ruler The Whisper is that they're going to go another 75 base points in December which is a complete change of the narrative they've been telling us for months now that it's November is going to be the last 75 and then they're going to 50 basis point and then they're going to see about slowing into 2023. I don't think that's happening at all uh I think the federal government is blind to it you know until there's a change of leadership and listen that might come too because the midterm elections are only four weeks away I think right now we're thinking about a split Congress so maybe the Republicans take the house the Democrats remain in control of the Senate but that creates gridlock that will actually be good for the market it will also be good for the federal government because there'll be gridlocked they won't be able to pass anymore ridiculous spending bills right so hopefully that'll take some of the pressure off now the stock market really is about confidence in the direction of the country and the health of the economy we've been tracking the polling numbers on those issues and we've consistently seen that around 70 percent of Americans feel the country is going in the wrong direction on the top of the list of Americans concerns every time every poll is the economy and inflation what are you seeing in the economic World in terms of confidence in the economy and direction of the country well I think it's clear that you know there is a sentiment it is starting to wane I think people are much more concerned now about the pace of inflation how entrenched it is whether or not they're ever going to catch up because look don't forget even though wages are up five percent uh uh inflation's up eight and a half percent so you're behind the eight ball three and a half percent every month right there are people out now with two and three jobs just trying to put food on the table and keep up and so therefore I uh the sense is that it's more of a struggle and I think people are going to start to express that the longer this goes on and I think part of that's going to be next month in the elections I think that's going to be the first expression of frustration amongst the electorate so my sense is you know as people really start to digest what does this PPI mean today's strong PPI what's it mean for tomorrow what's it mean for prices going down the road oils up again today the Saudis made it very clear last week they're not letting oil come in and so therefore that's going to continue to put pressure on on inflation well Kenny thanks so much for talking with us thanks for the time that was case capitals Kenny pokori coming up the Biden Administration spearheads a new diversity equity and inclusion plan at the federal level in an economy as volatile as this one it's important to have control when you're making a big purchase like a

the country's gold standard when it comes to diversity equity and inclusion Biden officials are working on a national strategy for Dei policies for the government which they hope private companies will copy daily wire investigative reporter Murray delordy is here with the details for us summer raid tell us about the administration's Dei plan hi Georgia so last week Biden's office of personnel management or OPM convened the first meeting of what they call the chief diversity officers executive Council this council is a group of diversity officers from different federal agencies and they're working on a massive plan for encouraging Dei policies in hiring and employment across the entire federal government OPM said the council will set clear benchmarks and metrics for Dei policies and will also work with quote public and private stakeholders on Dei policies the hope is that companies will use the Biden administration's Dei plan as a template for their own Dei policies in fact the OPM said it wants the federal government to be quote our country's model of Excellence now what do we know so far about the actual plan not much but Dr Janice Underwood is opm's Dei director which essentially makes her the federal government's Chief diversity officer and she talked a little bit about how the goal is to expand the Dei influence from government into society earlier this year Underwood said in an interview that we need more people who quote respect and affirm Dei to run for political office on both the local and federal levels so a core component may include hiring and promoting people who are outspoken proponents of Dei she also said we need Common Sense reasonable people to speak up about Dei at school board meetings in the media in the Town Square YMCA grocery store and on the campaign Trail now we actually reported earlier this year that Chief diversity officer was the fastest growing c-suite job title on at least one of the big job sites in 2020 and 2021 so this is really gaining a lot of steam in the private sector already right so most people will be familiar with diversity and inclusion trainings in the workplace and that's been around for years but a lot of companies created entire new departments and management positions to implement Dei after the death of George Floyd in 2020 and there are signs that that Trend could be here to stay upen's Wharton business school which consistently ranks as the nation's top business school recently moved to designate Dei and ESG as official academic concentrations this month it's not clear if this move was purposefully coordinated with this Dei push from the White House but it's likely that we'll see other business schools following suit especially if the business Community keeps demanding these types of jobs right and it sounds like that's the administration's goal Murray thanks for reporting thanks Georgia that was daily wire investigative reporter mairead alordi [Music] new information revealed from a foia request shows that the homeland security secretary knew hours before a famous press briefing one that sparked outrage and launched an investigation that border patrol agents were not in fact guilty of whipping Haitian migrants joining us to discuss is the man whose organization filed the foyer request Mike Howell director of the oversight project at Heritage Foundation so Mike we have a significant update on a story that dates back a year back to September 2021 first remind us about the sequence of events this all hinges on so it was an incident in Del Rio Texas where a large group of Haitian migrants were illegally crossing our border and they were being an improcess of apprehended by border patrol agents some of whom were on Horseback images came out and quickly uh those on the left said oh my gosh these horseback agents are whipping the migrants and you know a lie spread very quickly and went all the way to the White House and secretary mayorkas uh where they spread that fake news from the White House Podium an investigation occurred found no whipping regardless they held the agents responsible and it's just been a whole mess of throwing the border patrol under the bus so you're referencing statements from President Biden and secretary mayorkas here's some clips from those statements but it was horrible what to say as you saw to see people treated like they did horses really running them over people being strapped it's outrageous I promise you those people will pay we were indeed horrified by the images that does not reflect our policies our training uh nor our values and it is for that reason that we commenced immediately a fulsome and Swift investigation to determine what exactly occurred and why those officers depicted in the images are no longer performing their law enforcement duties during dependency of the investigation all right so the months-long investigation finds no wrongdoing and now we have an email that informed secretary mayorkas over two hours before he talked to the public in that press briefing that the allegation of whipping against the agents was actually false is that correct that's absolutely correct there is no need for an investigation he knew it at the time he called for an investigation he knew at the time that he said it conjured up the worst images of systemic racism in America it was all lie all farce and now who was it that informed mallorcas that this was actually a false narrative it was his top press staffer Marsha Espinoza who let him know a couple hours before he went to the podium and uh called out the border patrol and said that they were going to be punished has my orcas or the bite Administration responded at all to this new revelation no uh bill of malusian over at Fox News had reached out to him two days ago and no response reached out to him again this morning no response the only reason we're getting a response from foyo issued several months ago is because we're suing them in federal court and the judges saying they have to respond they're hiding well this is unfortunately how it works now this is a least transparent Administration history we all right of access to information under the Freedom of Information Act they just ignore it unless you can get lawyers and these things cost money resources and attention and that's why we the Heritage Foundation stood up the oversight projects you got to sue to get stuff out and so we filed suits several months ago and just a couple weeks or a week ago we started to get documents it's been a long process all right what are the next steps is there any recourse for any of the agents that were implicated in this investigation yes so legally speaking uh they're lawyers and they're represented by their Union s should take us into account because this shows there's no need for an investigation in the first place it was all farceman get going high highly politicized secondly we're calling on

    "JtuwLJBU7Vs": "new inflation numbers have stunned economists and sent shockwaves throughout the political world some calling this a nightmare scenario and where will Americans feel the price spikes most I'm daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley with Georgia Howe it's Friday October 14th and this is morning wire an NBC reporter is facing backlash for raising questions about Democrat John fetterman's mental Fitness after the Senate candidate's first in-person interview since his stroke because of his a stroke veterans campaign required closed captioning technology for this interview to essentially read our questions as we ask them and Lester in small talk before the interview without captioning it wasn't clear he was understanding our conversation we have the details behind the debate over ableism versus journalistic integrity and the George gascon recall committee has requested a review of the remove the controversial district attorney why do they say the process was tainted thanks for waking up with morning wire stay tuned we have the news you need to know [Music] the American economy is still feeling the traumatic effects of a two-year pandemic and lockdown induced recession which is why you should take action to hedge against inflation right now and solidify at least some of your Investment Portfolio with gold from Birch gold text wire to 989898 and Birch gold will send you a free information kit on how to diversify and protect your savings with precious metals that's w-i-r-e to 989898 to claim your free no obligation information kit on how to protect your hard-earned savings with gold text w i r e to 989898 to claim your free no obligation information kit on how to protect your hard-earned savings with gold [Music] yesterday the labor department announced that a key inflation tracker had spiked to a four decade High triggering a volatile Market reaction improving once again that inflation is not slowing down here with the latest on where the price increases are being felt most and what it means for Americans is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips so Cabot what's the latest on inflation well as Forbes put it it is a quote nightmare scenario the so-called core measure of the Consumer Price Index which basically attracts the cost of the most basic Goods saw its largest Spike since 1982. it was up 6.6 percent compared to this time last year now economists are especially concerned by high inflation on this core measure because it signifies high prices on things like Health Care and housing which usually take a lot longer to see any sort of decrease in pricing to that point housing costs also saw their highest increase since the early 1980s now which other products are seeing the high prices well take your pick I mean it's really across the board airline tickets are up 42 in the last year eggs are now up 30 percent electricity 15 bread 14 Furniture 10 and and used cars up seven percent and it gets even worse when you remember that the real hourly earnings rate the metric which tracks wage growth compared to increases for cost of living has been negative for 18 straight months now it's also worth pointing out that inflation is hitting areas in the market that have typically been viewed as safe havens for more cautious investors for example bonds have had their worst year since get this 1931. AKA The Great Depression they've Fallen 11 this year alone now just to clarify this is year-on-year inflation from September of last year when we already started seeing spikes in inflation exactly so rates were already increasing as of 2021 if you look at the last two years you know all together it's even worse it sounds now what's been the latest response from the federal government to remedy this well for starters the new figures almost guarantee that the FED will Implement another large interest rate hike at their meeting next month the Social Security Administration announced Thursday that recipients would be receiving an 8.7 percent increase in their payments next year that is the largest increase we've seen in more than four decades and follows the already massive 5.9 percent increase that they granted earlier this year keep in mind 42 percent of elderly women and 37 percent of elderly men rely on social security for at least half of their income each month and they say inflation is just Rising quicker than their Social Security payments can keep up with now obviously this is close to midterms and everything has a political tie-in right now how does this factor in yeah you bring up a good point this was the final inflation report before election day so Democrats were hoping it would show some signs of things going in the right direction but obviously it showed the opposite there's just no denying it this report comes at the worst possible time for Democrats as early voting in some Battleground States is just getting underway Biden's Chief Economist Brian deese appeared on CNN have a listen the United States is in a better and stronger position to take this challenge head on than virtually any other country in the world that's in no small part because of the policies that we've put in place Brian just telling Americans that things aren't as bad here as they are around the world really isn't a reassuring statement and how are Republicans responding to this news as you can imagine they've been quick to point out that President Biden has been predicting for months now that inflation was going to go down and we just have not seen it and another message we've seen from the right has sort of been I Told You So they say that they warned Democrats throughout the past two years that passing trillions of dollars worth of new spending bills would make inflation worse and expect to hear more on that as election day approaches all right Cabot thanks for reporting anytime that was daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips do you like to be the

to the best commentary to break it all down download The Daily wire Plus app and keep up with the facts no matter where your day takes you [Music] NBC news reporter Dasha Burns is taking heat from left-leaning media for a description of her interview with Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Federman this week fetterman is still recovering from a stroke he suffered just prior to the primary this year and is having issues with auditory processing here to talk about it is columnist David Marcus so Dave what did Burns say and why are people so upset about it good morning Burns said on air that before the closed captioning got up and running fetterman had a hard time understanding the small talk they were engaged in it comes at a time in his race against Republican Mehmet Oz when there's growing pressure for him to release more medical records about his current condition clearly and I think responsibly Burns thought it was newsworthy that the candidate had this difficulty many liberals and fetterman allies took exception to this and openly attacked Burns even her own network questioned the reporter's segment since then other journalists who've also dealt with fettermen came forward and said they had a different experience yeah and Savannah that's completely fair that that was their experience we can only report our own I will say it's important to note that according to the campaign itself our team was the first to be in the room with fetterman for an interview rather than via remote video conference and myself my producer and our crew did find that small talk before that captioning was was difficult because of those auditory processing issues I mentioned who are some of the folks who were a part of this backlash did they think that burns was not telling the truth or that she shouldn't have said anything about it there's a mix actually a few left-wing journalists like Molly John frast and Cara Swisher who suffered a stroke herself in 2011 left onto Twitter to say they had recently interviewed federan and he was fine it's not clear how those interviews were conducted but others like the hosts of The View who also chimed in on this believed the incident occurred as Burns describes it but that she wrote protocol or ethics by disclosing something off the Record which is not how that works right there are also claims of ableism that any concern about his speech or comprehension is tantamount to anti-disabled bigotry I mean a lot of spaghetti got thrown against the wall although basically all of it suggesting that fetterman's condition is not a big deal the ableist argument is interesting but this isn't a physical handicap we're talking about here this is cognitive impairment right right uh fetterman's allies argue that this use of closed captioning devices is really no different than if a blind or deaf Senator needed assistive technology but a blind or deaf Senator can can still make unimpaired decisions how is that argument sitting with his opponent Oz and with voters it really circles back to the medical records question certainly Oz and Republicans and some independent voters have real questions about whether this is something that is purely mechanical or if there is a cognitive aspect to it and without the records it's mostly been guesswork meanwhile democrats for the most part have rallied round the flag and say this isn't a problem and that anyway by January when he would take office uh he should be significantly better well it's hard to know how these kinds of conditions will advance is it unusual for the media to have to accommodate a candidate to this degree it feels like we're maybe in Uncharted Territory here in terms of the debate setup yeah I mean it really feels Uncharted although questions of health and fitness are common in campaigns I think the suddenness of the stroke and its effects has the news media on its heels balancing for example as Burns did respect and discretion with newsworthiness and even opinion columnist you know have had to blunt their elbows a bit because this kind of stroke is is somber and it's a serious thing yeah but I think that unlike say the news media hiding um FDR's wheelchair you can't hide this he's clearly reading and not engaged one-on-one look it's a fair thing for voters to consider now this is one of a handful of toss-up states that could sway control of the Senate the race which fetterman has led throughout has tightened of late down to about two points in some polls do we have a sense of how this might impact the outcome we don't really know yet we might soon but as the election gets closer and closer there's only going to be more attention on fetterman's condition whether he chooses to release more records or not it's up to him to convince the voters of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that he's fit to serve David thanks for coming on thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus [Music] the group that organized the recall effort against Los Angeles District Attorney George gascon announced this week that it plans on suing the County's Registrar of Voters alleging that voter rolls were artificially inflated and some of the signatures were falsely invalidated resulting in the recall being tossed out joining us to discuss is daily wire reporter Brandon Dre so Brandon we've covered this on the show that the recall effort against gascon over his Progressive or soft on crime policies was thrown out after a bunch of signatures were invalidated what is the recall campaign arguing here exactly hey Georgia so they're arguing two things that the bar was set too high for the total of Voters and too many of the signatures were invalidated the campaigns committee said in a press release that independent and non-partisan analysts estimated that LA County active voter rolls were overshot between at least 200 000 and 500 000 voters when County officials initially set the bar of valid signatures for the recall to qualify now the committee officials say the registrar's counting process was and I'm quoting here seriously flawed resulting in substantial errors the wrongful invalidation of many valid signatures and the disenfranchisement of thousands of Los Angeles County voters how did they come to that conclusion well last month the committee began conducting a review of the invalidated signatures with volunteer attorneys now if you remember a huge percentage about 28 percent of them were thrown out we've never seen that high a percentage before it's usually more around 15 so a couple things were discovered in the review process process first of all they claim 39 of the signatures were improperly invalidated signatures so for example some signatures collected were marked as non-matching despite showing similarities to the signatures on file whereas others were marked invalid due to more concerning things like duplicate signatures or the wrong address now the committee also pointed to what they're calling bloated voter rolls they say that led to a threshold that was unfairly High to begin with unpack that for us so the original requirement was set at 566 857 signatures to qualify which was 10 of all Los Angeles County active voters but according to the campaign's initial review the number of qualifying signatures should have been set anywhere from 515 000 to 546 000. now even with all those signatures thrown out they still had 520 000 deemed valid in other words they may have had enough to meet the real threshold now the recall D.A George gascon committee they said that they would file an injunctive relief as early as next week if that happens what do we expect the registrar's office to do so I reached out to them and a spokesperson told me that they have not seen the petition for relief yet but when and if it is received they would respond accordingly but officials from the recall have accused the registrar's office of placing quote arbitrary and capricious limitations on the review process which limits the number of hours workstations and number of reviewers that would help them determine whether the invalid signatures are legitimate and what kind of timeline are we looking at here for any kind of real action well the recall committee said that with the current restrictions imposed by the registrar the process would take more than a year to review the invalidated signatures so angelinos who want gascon out of office are likely looking at a long time before any potential recourse against his policies and critics continue to sound the alarm about his policies making criminals feel emboldened and residents feel unsafe Brandon thanks for coming on thank you for having me that was daily wire reporter Brandon Drey

least two dozen injured on Monday the shooter was charged with five counts of murder and five counts of bias motivated crimes or what authorities are calling a hate crime the tragedy occurred in Colorado Springs and details are still emerging about the shooter and his motive daily wire investigative reporter Marie delordy is here with the details for us keeping in mind the daily wire policy of not naming Mass Shooters what do we know so far hi Georgia of course so this horrific shooting happened at a Colorado Springs gay nightclub called Club Q five people have died and at least 25 were injured seven of those people are in critical condition the alleged shooter is a 22 year old man who is now in custody and was treated for injuries according to police the suspect entered the club and immediately began shooting with a long rifle at least two Club goers rushed the shooter and managed to successfully subdue him and stop him from hurting even more people here's Colorado Springs police chief Adrian Vasquez at least two heroic people inside the club confronted and fought with the suspect and were able to stop stop the suspect from continuing to kill and harm others one of the club goers is said to have hit the shooter with the gunman's own weapon police arrived within minutes and found at least two firearms on the scene a semi-automatic weapon and a handgun as well as more ammunition magazines the shooter is now facing five counts of first degree murder and five counts of a bias motivated crime that caused bodily injury now do we have any confirmed information about the shooter's motive he obviously chose a venue associated with gay men we don't have a Manifesto or statement or social media evidence yet but what we do know is that this alleged shooter has a troubled history of threatening violence in June of 2021 he threatened his mother with a homemade bomb police apparently took the threat extremely seriously going so far as to evacuate homes within a quarter mile but he was never charged police said afterwards that they had found no explosives at the time the alleged shooter already owned guns and ammunition Colorado's red flag law would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns at least temporarily but that apparently never happened given the terroristic nature of the crime there has been some discussion about a possible political motive but until we have more information from his social media accounts or a statement to police it's hard to say anything for sure the shooter did register to vote in 2021 but did not list a party affiliation some media Outlets have highlighted the fact that the shooter's grandfather Randy vopal served as the Republican mayor of Santee city in California for more than a decade regardless we will need to wait for the investigation to continue to know what motivated this crime right well we will continue to monitor Marie thanks for reporting thanks Georgia that was daily wire investigative reporter

in Maricopa County Arizona attorney general Mark brnovich's demanding answers daily wires Amanda Presta Giacomo joins to discuss hey Amanda so what's the latest on the Arizona election turmoil hi John so Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs the state's Democratic candidate is the projected winner of the governor's race but notably Republican Challenger Carrie lake has yet to concede and indicated last week a coming legal challenge so on Saturday the state's outgoing AG Mark bernovich ordered Maricopa County officials to submit a report on its handling of the November 8th election which can only be described as botched here's one unhappy voter Matt Baker speaking to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors now ask yourself the question which is more valuable your Vote or your money now ask a lobbyist that same question now ask a campaign manager that question which is more valuable your money or your Vote or your country or this world or the corruption that is taking over every single County in this nation yeah so lots of anger there this election printers at 70 of the County's 223 polling locations printed ballots with ink too light to be read by tabulation machines that cause long wait lines across precincts as election officials try to sort out the issues voters were forced to either wait in long lines up to three hours sometimes travel to a new polling location or drop their ballots and drop boxes to be counted in Phoenix and those were just some of the issues yeah lots of problems tell us more about this letter from the election Integrity unit of the AG's office the letter said there's evidence including first-hand witness accounts of quote statutory violations in the contest which again this is overseen by Hobbes as Secretary of States Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Wright said in a letter that arizonans deserve a full report in accounting of the Myriad of problems that occurred in relation to Maricopa County's administration of the 2022 general election right said these issues relate to the County's ability to lawfully certify the election results she ordered a response before the county submits its official canvas to the Secretary of State which must occur on or before November 28th now a lot of people have been watching to see how Kerry Lake responds to all of this what has she said yeah she's definitely responded on Monday afternoon she went to her Twitter account and she posted a video addressing her supporters and of course mentioning the letter from the AG's office fittingly for Lake she reaffirmed her commitment to continue to fight saying that this was the most chaotic election in Arizona history and that these voting issues transcend politics whether done accidentally or intentionally it is clear that this election was a debacle that destroyed any trust in our elections arizonans who choose to make their voice heard on Election Day should not be disenfranchised or punished for choosing to vote in person yet they were and what about Maricopa County officials what are they saying well Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates he's a republican he hasn't commented on the ages letter but he's maintained that the election was Secure on Sunday he told the press that he's actually moved to an undisclosed location over safety concerns after his office received death threats connected to the midterm elections so what can we expect next in Arizona well we have to see how Maricopa County officials will respond to the AG's office specifically this letter and if these election concerns will be quelled or rectified in any way but for now we do have a show of solidarity with Maricopa County we have Mojave County and Cochise County in Arizona they're going to wait to certify their results until November 28th as well all right so we'll see what they do next week Amanda thanks for reporting yeah my pleasure that was daily wire reporter Amanda Presto Giacomo foreign used to be limited to the one day after Thanksgiving but this year in an effort to lure in Shoppers big discounts started being advertised as early as October the extended deals come after two years of scarcity and supply chain delays that kept discounts to a minimum here to discuss is daily wire senior editor Ash short so Ash I've been getting Black Friday ads for a few weeks now and I don't remember it being this dragged out in the past well it's interesting just in my lifetime we've gone from Black Friday meaning stores opened at 5 or 6 a.m at stores opening at midnight and now to Deals being offered even a month in advance and part of the reason we've gotten to this point is that stores found they needed to compete against Cyber Monday which is a day online Shoppers receive big discounts and doesn't require people to leave their homes so aside from the depressing slide into consumerism at least there isn't the same pressure now to go fight crowds the day after Thanksgiving right exactly some people are now calling it Black November to account for the fact that discounts are not just one day at the end of the month although some Brands started their deals as early as October now where are we seeing the best deals and then how do those deals actually stack up when you factor in inflation the discounts are being primarily seen in the clothing industry clothing retailers have been reducing prices for months even as inflation remains high in part to accommodate the holiday shopping rush in an attempt to shore up profits for the year retailers including Gap American Eagle and Victoria's Secret have all said they were charging Less on average for clothing this past summer than they had in 2021 but what about the other Industries other industry prices are rising with inflation appliances Furniture electronics toys and beauty products all gift favorites saw prices increase over the past year even with holiday deals inflation means consumers will still pay more for these items than they would have a year ago it all goes back to the Sky High inflation we're still experiencing in October the Consumer Price Index Rose 0.4 percent which means the annual increase was just under 8 grocery prices are still high and gas prices have come down a bit but the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates making it more difficult for consumers to make big ticket purchases like homes and cars now aside from clothing prices is there any other good news for consumers Yes actually the supply chain issues have pretty much resolved prior to the pandemic retailers would over buy and then offer discounts at the end of the year eating into their profits the pandemic broke that cycle but only temporarily we're now back to that pre-pandemic Cycle Plus the fact that the Deal started weeks ago means Shoppers have plenty of time to get the gifts they need for the holiday season at a discount and don't forget there's just over a month left until Christmas right I still have not bought anything Ash thanks for reporting you're welcome that was daily wire senior editor Ash short other stories we're tracking this week on Monday the Iranian men's soccer team refused to sing the

make the platform a friendlier forum for free speech meanwhile the bite Administration says it's monitoring the situation and according to musk apple is threatening to drop Twitter from its App Store daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham is here now to give us the latest on the blowback to musk's new policies at Twitter so Megan there's been a lot of news about Twitter in the last few days but one of the most significant developments came from the White House what's going on there well you know musk has made it clear since he first made his offer to buy Twitter back in April that one of his key priorities was easing moderation practices and also allowing users to speak more freely on the platform as you noted well we've already seen him lift suspensions from public figures like former president Trump and the Babylon B for instance but then on November 23rd Twitter officially did away with its covid misinformation policy and that was left over from the company's previous leadership well that was the policy that empowered moderators to censor posts that question things like the effectiveness of masks or vaccines musk has also now promised to release internal Twitter documentation showing how and why moderators chose to suppress speech like the New York post's Hunter Biden laptop story he said the public deserves to know and that it's necessary to restore public Trust Jake Denton a researcher in the Heritage foundation's Tech policy Center told us that musk's new policies could actually drastically change the kind of discourse that we're seeing on Twitter these Grassroots ordinary folks that have been de-platformed are not going to behave in the way that you know these activists prefer they're going to engage with you know whether it be tweets from you know controversial conservative influencers to just kind of more Grassroots journalism is kind of a Detachment from what the ruling class would prefer to have on Twitter so all of this seems to have caught the attention of the Biden Administration this was White House Press Secretary Karin Jean-Pierre responding to a question about Twitter's new policies on Monday look um we you know we have always been very clear um and that when it comes to social media platforms it is their responsibility to make sure that when it comes to misinformation when we when we come to the hate that we're seeing uh that they they take action musk tweeted shortly after this and I'm gonna quote this is a battle for the future of civilization if free speech is lost even in America tyranny is all that lies ahead so possibly a battle Brewing there between the Biden Administration and Twitter maybe even more significant is the action we're seeing from Apple tell us about that yeah that's a good point so musk has said that Apple has pulled most of its advertising from Twitter and is even threatening to drop the platform from its App Store now that's something we have seen before when Apple and Google Android dropped parlor from their stores ostensibly once again over content moderation and that move essentially crippled what was an emerging platform it's also worth noting that the Apple executive who heads up the app store Phil Schiller deleted his Twitter account last week so musk tagged Apple CEO Tim Cook to ask him what's going on and he later tweeted of Apple do they hate free speech in America so while the White House may be standing against Twitter the company is finding some support among Republicans Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had this to say that would be a huge huge mistake and it would be a really raw exercise of monopolistic power that I think would Merit a response from the United States Congress for musk's part he said that if Apple tries to remove Twitter from the App Store he will make an alternative phone well if anyone can do it I think Elon Musk is the guy Megan thanks for reporting yeah anytime that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham coming up

federal government's authority to direct it on Tuesday the case began with a lawsuit Texas and Louisiana filed against the Biden Administration last year here to break down the case and what's at stake as daily wire reporter Tim Pierce hey Tim so first give us an overview of the case yeah sure this case centers around a DHS memo that places restrictions on which illegal aliens federal law enforcement should Target arrest and Deport in September of last year DHS secretary Alejandro mayorcas wrote a memo that directed federal agents mainly ice agents to prioritize aliens to threatened U.S security and safety for arrest and removal the memo says the federal law enforcement should consider mitigating or aggravating factors in each case in other words if someone is found to be in the U.S illegally officials should consider whether it's worth it to detain and Deport them based off the priorities in the memo mayork has set out three classes of priority removals threats to National Security which are aliens considered to be their spies or terrorists then there are threats to border security which the memo defines as aliens who entered the U.S illegally after November 1st 2020 and finally there are threats to Public Safety who are aliens convicted of serious criminal conduct so those are the migrants that mayorkas says should be considered a priority in deporting which migrants are considered low priority that would be the estimated 11 million migrants who are living in the U.S illegally and who got here before that November 1st 2020 cut off all right so the obvious question then is why is my orcas restricting deportations if those millions of migrants are also in the U.S illegally while the Biden Administration says it comes down to making the most efficient use of limited resources its basic argument is that Federal officials can't remove 11 million aliens from the U.S so it needs to set these priorities to take care of the highest risk threats first the Attorneys General of Texas and Louisiana say that regardless of resources Congress did not give DHS discretion to decide which illegal aliens to deport and which to avoid the states are staking their case on the wording of federal immigration law which is riddled with the word shall such as shall take into custody and shall remove the states argue that the wording limits discretion in enforcing immigration laws the Biden Administration argues that the courts have traditionally understood that the federal government has broad discretion to deal with illegal aliens and in any event the federal government can't reasonably be expected to adhere to such a strict interpretation of the statute when it lacks the resources to enforce the law in totality all right so there's a couple of other issues involved in this case tell us about what else is at play here sure one is standing the Biden Administration says that the states can't meet the threshold of harm necessary to challenge the DHS memo the states say that the federal government's selective enforcement has left them on the hook for paying to care for The migrants Who Won't be deported the Biden Administration says that those kinds of indirect costs have never been considered a firm foundation for states to sue the other issue is whether a U.S District Judge has the authority to freeze the Biden administration's order judge Drew Tipton sided with Texas and Louisiana last year and put the directive on hold the Biden Administration says that generally the Supreme Court has the authority to restrict the federal government's immigration enforcement not lower courts well we'll have to wait to see how the Supreme Court decides to settle this next year Tim thanks for joining us that was daily wires Tim Pierce [Music] celebrity promoted fashion brand Balenciaga is suing an ad production company after the Brand's campaign was criticized for being evocative of child pornography here to discuss the controversy is daily wire reporter Amanda prestigmo so Amanda let's back up a little bit we first heard about this Scandal last week can you briefly recap what happened hey Georgia yeah last week the luxury brand released its Campaign which featured very young children maybe as young as four years old they're holding teddy bears and bondage gear the Bears were apparently purses but they look like children's toys which was clearly the theme of the ad it was about as bad as it sounds too the Bears appear to have black and out eyes and they're dressed in BDSM gear like fishnet tops and leather harnesses the kids are also surrounded by adult items like wine glasses and leather dog collars too and just to note the children in these photos are not smiling in one case a young child is lying prone on a couch looking zonked out with wine glasses in the foreground so when these images surface online they were immediately met with a lot of backlash internet sluice took to the Balenciaga website to look for more examples of this questionable content they quickly found photos from a July campaign featuring abalenciaga an Adidas mashup purse this purse was rested on top of some court papers that include an excerpt from a U.S Supreme Court opinion in the United States versus Williams now this particular case ruled on the constitutionality of a law prohibiting the pandering of child pornography kind of an odd thing to have in this fashion shoot and just a side note the internet sleuths turned up some other strange things too in one example from the spring 2023 campaign it featured two books in the background one by an artist named Mikhail borman's which features extraordinarily disturbing images of naked castrated children soaked in blood other images showed Mass individuals eating human limbs the other featured book the cremaster cycle is equally disturbing so unsurprisingly the backlash online was Swift and fierce initially this was just from the right but it also got some buzz in the mainstream for example even Sunny hosting she's a liberal host on The View she offered some mild criticism for the brand although she did stop short of condemning that outright now what has balenciaga's response been to this criticism well initially the brand just went dark they wiped their Instagram page and they deleted all those images from their website they later offered a lengthy apology online for quote any offense their campaign may have caused they also acknowledge that those plush bondage teddy bears should not have been featured with children pretty soon after that the company seemed to shift the blame to the production company that was contracted for that on Friday they filed a lawsuit against a production company called North six as well as the set designer Nicholas desjarda the suit specifically claims that North 6 and the set designer are responsible for the child porn related documents that appeared in the ad from the purse again that's not the bondage teddy bear ads that those from a different campaign the fashion brand claims to be the victim of inexplicable acts and Emissions regarding this at the very least extraordinarily Reckless content the suit says Balenciaga is seeking out at least 25 million dollars in Damages for the alleged false association between the brand and the quote repulsive and deeply disturbing subject of the Court decision now how is this suit expected to fare in the courts well desjarda has blasted Balenciaga for using him as a scapegoat he claims that the brand was completely in the loop the whole time a statement from his agent says quote everyone from Balenciaga was on the shoot and was present on every shot and worked on the edit of every image in post-production so Balenciaga will have to prove that wasn't the case now what about the celebrities that have promoted Balenciaga are they now trying to distance themselves a little bit yeah that's a great question since Balenciaga is kind of known for being the celebrity brand you know for example we have model Bella Hadid and actress Nicole Kidman they often promote it they're a lot more too uh their most famous fan though has to be Kim Kardashian and so far she's the only star to speak out on Monday she announced she was reevaluating her partnership with the brand she has not cut ties as of now but for now it looks like a majority of Balenciaga celebrity fans are willing to stay loyal despite this awesome really disturbing stuff Amanda thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wire reporter Amanda prestigmo

    "bbMN-eP2N70": "joe rogan just called on his over 11 million listeners to vote republican so what do you tell those people vote republican rogan has historically remained neutral on politics and if anything he has voted democrat in the past while he remains critical of both sides of the aisle for numerous reasons he flat out told his followers the democrats messed up so badly that we might all as well just vote republican he even went so far as to cite that over one million people have recently gone to the right side of the political aisle and he's exactly right according to voter registration data analyzed by the associated press over 1 million voters across 43 states have switched the republican party in the last year it's looking more and more like that so-called red wave is really coming ride the big red wave dude with only a few months away from the midterms it has people thinking who will be the leader of the growing pack of republicans in 2024 and while there is very little concrete evidence yet there are plenty of clues that we can analyze to determine who to keep an eye on and who may be gunning for a presidential ticket the washington post has been doing quarterly rankings of the republican party's most likely 2024 nominee for several months and found quite unsurprisingly that the number one frontrunner has continually been president donald trump there is no question that trump still has tremendous influence over the republican party look no further than the recent annihilation of republican and anti-trumper liz cheney in the wyoming primary but trump definitely has a target on his back which some say make him an even stronger candidate the recent fbi raid on mar-a-lago has many speculating that there is a frantic search to find trump ineligible to run again in 2024. some republicans are eager to watch trump run for the third time however other republicans are growing tired of the constant battle and political baggage he carries they desire someone with trump's finest qualities but without the trump in the latest washington post ranking florida governor ron desantis just happened to jump to number one on wapo's list and when it comes to someone who shares many trump qualities but isn't trump desantis fits the bill in recent years it's been desantis fighting some of the most prevalent cultural battles of our country head on if you are trying to lock people down i am standing in your way and i'm standing for the people of florida it seems like desantis is trending every other week for a new remark or legislation unashamedly owning the libs but right now it seems like desantis is focusing on winning re-election as florida's governor but there are other candidates who might be eyeing a presidential run for starters former secretary of state mike pompeo is showing indicators of someone who may run like running ads in iowa and south carolina in late august pompeo made pretty convincing remarks about a potential presidential run at u.s representative jess duncan's faith and freedom barbecue saying if i come to believe i ought to become president that i have something to offer to the american people i will run no matter who all decides to get in and who all decides not to get in the race next up is former south carolina governor nikki haley who recently gave what appears to be her strongest hint yet as a quick refresher haley served as a top diplomat to the united nations under former president trump and according to trump she had done a fantastic job in her role in a recent interview with fox haley said we've got enemies trying to come after us and america has been naive it's been weak and it's been asleep at the wheel i'm just saying sometimes it takes a woman and margaret thatcher said if you want something said ask a man and if you want something done ask a woman another potential contender is texas senator ted cruz cruz has also been on the front lines of the culture war engaging with far left ideologies and getting into heated debates with government officials on the senate floor cruz recently stated that he will wait and see if trump decides to run before he makes his own decision about running another familiar name who you may see on the 2024 ballot is former vice president mike pence many are wondering if pence is planning to run especially after his recent visit to the iowa state fair a place many presidential candidates historically visit in lieu of an upcoming presidential race however while he was there he downplayed the significance of attending the famous state fair saying that he was there solely to support the re-election of senator chuck grassley however pence did not totally shut down the idea while he was there he also said that he and his family plan to reflect and prey on where we might next serve and where we might next contribute meanwhile in the democratic camp there is perhaps less energy behind a re-election bid for joe biden come on give me a break man and it is becoming increasingly clear that the democrats really don't want biden in 2024 75 of democrat voters to be exact do you want to see joe biden run for a second term yeah i you know that's an easy question that's not going to take long do you want to see joel i want to answer that question because we have not that's not yet i don't want to answer that question come on man take a hint so republicans and democrats are ready for a change and there are lots of candidates who could be eyeing a presidential ticket the question now remains who will end up running and more importantly who will win",

now says he plans to run again Following last month's midterm results with more on how Democrat leaders are handling the prospect of another Biden term and the impact his age could have on the race is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips so Cabot it's typically a given that a sitting president will run for re-election but Biden has waffled a bit on this subject in the past what can you tell us yeah historically you can count on one hand how many presidents have declined to run for a second term so the fact that Biden had been hesitant to commit to running again is definitely noteworthy as the president's first two years have unfolded we've seen him give a range of answers on re-election so when he first came to office his approval rating was well above 50 and there was not much of a question if he would run again it was sort of a given but as his ratings started to plummet after the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that was really the turning point and then they started to fall further into the mid 30s as inflation took hold he started to become more non-committal about a second run right but that has all changed in recent weeks it has in a very short amount of time Biden went from saying that he had not made up his mind about 2024 to saying that he was intent on running and that he had been intent on running all along for example here he is two months ago when asked about re-election is it a firm decision that I've run again that remains to be seen so a bit passive but now compare that answer to this response from two weeks ago when he was asked the same question Our intention is to run again that's been Our intention regardless of what the outcome of this election was later in that interview Biden went on to say that he would be meeting with his family before Christmas and would likely make an announcement early in the new year now how much of this shift can be attributed to his success in the midterms yeah it's clearly a huge Factor so coming into the midterms it did seem like Democrats were going to lose the House and Senate and that Biden himself would be a big reason for the poor performance remember before the midterms many Democrats were already starting to blame him for losing Congress and a lot of people viewed that as Democrats setting the stage for pushing him off the 2024 ticket there were even a number of elected officials waffling publicly about if he should run again you don't typically see members of a party criticizing their president that publicly but the relative success of Democrats on Election Day Has Not only emboldened the president and his allies but it's also left many Party leaders saying well we've got to stick with him for now for example Senator Chris Coons from the president's home state of Delaware said after the midterm results quote it would be hard to not look at that and say okay there's still a role there's still a path there's still important things to do referring to Biden's re-election right but it sounds like there are still some who don't want him to run again is that correct right while many of his critics right now might be hesitant to say publicly there are certainly those who feel that way behind closed doors and that extends to voters as well CNN's midterm exit poll for example showed 67 percent of Americans saying they did not want Biden to run in 2024 while a separate New York Times poll over the summer found that nearly two-thirds of Democrats would prefer another candidate and remember buying's approval rating is still hovering around 40 percent so he would have his work cut out for him regardless of who ends up being the Republican nominee now how old will the president be and how is his age going to factor into this last week Biden turned 80 years old making him the first octogenarian in presidential history but even though that's a big milestone most people probably did not hear much about his birthday and that's intentional that's because the White House reportedly did not want to draw attention to the president's age for obvious political purposes now if he were to win re-election Biden would be 86 years old by the time he left office which would make him the oldest president ever by nearly a full decade Reagan was 77 when he left office and Craig's point to instances of him stumbling to find words during interviews and appearing to fall asleep during conferences with foreign leaders as evidence that he's suffering from cognitive decline and should bow out but that's a touchy subject politically for obvious reasons so as 2024 approaches watch how both sides address the issue of his age because not going to go away all right well Cabot thanks so much for reporting anytime that was daily wire senior editor

mayor Eric Adams is implementing a directive and working with the state legislature to revise laws that will make it easier for emergency responders to detain some mentally ill people living on the streets the new measures come as the city has dealt with a Spate of deadly violence committed by the mentally ill including passengers being pushed in the subway and brutal aggressive assaults columnist David Marcus joins us now to talk about all this so Dave what exactly has changed now that Bayer Adams has sort of tweaked The Rules of Engagement for policer morning uh prior to the directive non-medical emergency responders most importantly police were limited in their ability to intervene on the basis of mental health and bring a person into the hospital unless they posed an overt threat to themselves or to others now that is expanded to include people who are unable to quote meet basic needs for health and safety unquote so this is a much broader test and should allow police a lot more flexibility in dealing with what as you say has become an increasingly big problem in the city and across the country what are some of the circumstances in which police could intervene in ways they haven't previously been able to do mayor Adams focused on the previous standard being and quote overt threat end quote to harm others or oneself as too vague even calling it a myth that leads to many situations where police are powerless unless there is actual violence or a very direct threat of suicide yeah so for example somebody clearly in distress who's yelling at pedestrians or Subway Riders can now be detained ostensively for their own good but also of course to make the city safer importantly once a person arrives at the hospital it is medical professionals who determine if they should be committed not law enforcement okay now that the mayor has significant support including from Governor Kathy hokel there are some critics of this policy what issues do they raise and what alternatives do they give so the New York City civil liberties Union among others have come out against it basically because they argue it's essentially arresting someone for maybe committing a crime in the future and In fairness look that is a slippery slope but to the second part of your question their plan B seems to be the status quo right now though as we've seen in recent elections these concerns about crime are so great that public sentiment seems to be behind the plan though I will say there may well be lawsuits once it's implemented you're right now are there concerns that the city may not actually have enough facilities or beds to handle an influx of new patients what about that issue yeah there are uh in fact the city's public Advocate has said that some such institutions have dropped by half in number uh in the city since 2019 but look it's important to remember that not all of the people swept in by this will be admitted to the hospital or kept very long in some measure it's about diffusing the immediate situation that activates the interaction even if that doesn't lead to a better long-term outcome do you see this as something that could be a model for other cities dealing with the same problem I'm thinking of places like San Francisco and Los Angeles quite possibly especially if it's successful to some degree this is a mindset progressives in recent decades have moved to a position where they argue non-intervention is the best policy that providing material support instead has the biggest impact and it could also lead to wasted resources absolutely Dave thanks for joining us thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus [Music] the Biden Administration is taking heat for what critics say is a weak response to the growing Chinese protests against the Communist regime's Draconian lockdown measures here to discuss this daily wire reporter Amanda prestigmo hey man first what is the administration's response been so far to these historic protests in China they rather type didn't then protests other than to say that they generally support everyone's right to peacefully protest instead we received a response from an unnamed spokesperson from the National Security Council lightly criticizing China's zero covet policy and they just basically called it ineffective rather than comment on the clear abuses associated with implementing such a policy how is the political world responded told us we've seen a lot of people in the GOP especially strongly condemn the CCP and they're using their platforms online to do this a step further we do have some Republicans publicly calling out the Biden Administration over its response for example leading house Republican Kevin McCarthy he slammed President Biden in the corporate class for quote shrugging as Chinese citizens bravely protest and then we have Florida Senator Marco Rubio he called the Biden response very weak the senator went on to accuse the administration of being hamstrung to really criticize the CCP for their covid policies since politicians in the Democratic Party wanted people arrested and fined and businesses closed during the pandemic Rubio noted that he wasn't making a direct comparison here and that quote nothing compares to what the CCP are doing right now to that point many have noted that we actually did see early on in the pandemic many world leaders including key figures in the U.S praising China for their efforts to so-called stop the spread correct yeah that's right I mean we had the world economic Forum notably he preys on China for the regime's early response and this is all archived on the forum's website even now keep in mind early on we did see those horrifying videos of authorities in China literally welding people inside their homes and then we have Dr Anthony fauci he helped lead the lockdown measures here in the U.S he said in October 2020 that it was unfortunate the U.S didn't model our early lockdown to be more like China I recommended to the president that we shut the country down and that was very difficult decision because I knew it would have serious Economic Consequences which it did but there was no way to stop the explosive spread that we knew would occur if we didn't do that fast forward to April of this year fauci again said China was quote doing better than almost anyone else with its early covet response his argument seems to be in favor of these Draconian lockdown measures as a short-term solution which he said could effectively be leveraged to get people vaccinated and then open up again this sort of pro-china support was certainly echoed in the mainstream press too as for the protests what's happening now and and what about this growing support we're seeing from the Chinese demonstrators here in the U.S well despite Chinese authorities continuing to aggressively crack down on these protesters the movement is growing demonstrations have spread to at least 16 cities now and as you mentioned John protests have gained support here in America too especially on college campuses there have been demonstrations at Duke North Carolina University of California Berkeley and Columbia to name a few these do seem to be led by Chinese students hear some of that action at Columbia say no to noticed the ship Give me liberty

coffee supporting veterans and America's coffee [Music] for the first time in his presidency President Biden met in person with China's leader Xi Jinping on Monday in Indonesia after repeatedly stating over the last year that the U.S would come to taiwan's defense if China invaded President Biden came away from the meeting saying he did not think that China posed a threat to Taiwan I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan and I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all joining us to discuss is Brent Sadler a former Pentagon official and Military Diplomat to Asia and now a senior research fellow at Heritage welcome Brett so President Biden said after the meeting he does not believe China is a threat to Taiwan yet Congress is moving forward with a plan to send a multi-billion dollar weapons package to Taiwan in an effort to ward off a potential Invasion so what is the administration's stance on this uh it's yet another example of confusion from D.C President Biden himself on numerous occasions said that the U.S would support and defend Taiwan should the Chinese Communist Party attack the island but statements like this and also the White House staff have said similar things it just makes it more confusing and if you're watching the United States from Beijing I don't think they really get a clear picture one way or the other even with this most recent statement from President Biden that there is no threat the reality is our military our investments in a stronger defense and our partners in the region most notably the Japanese all see China as a military threat that's here and present right now you mentioned beijing's perspective how is China characterizing the meeting to the Chinese people characterize it as the Americans willing to come to the table and seeing that a forceful posture against China is unworkable that's that's how they're going to start playing it as far as we can tell President Biden did not bring up the issue of covid or fentanyl why not and is this a mistake by the president I think it's absolutely a mistake not to bring up either one of those I wouldn't expect the Chinese or Xi Jinping to make any concessions or any commitments on either one but certainly failing to bring up covid and Fentanyl it makes no sense why not to raise those now these presidential meetings are always hyper analyzed any notable moments that could end up being significant most notably is that Xi Jinping is traveling outside of China for the first time in quite a long time since covid but I will say there was at least one optic that got my attention well when they both met the video clip that keeps getting replayed certainly doesn't play well at least to American interest and that is when you see President Xi Jinping standing stoically on the left stage left you see President Biden enter energetically walking towards him with his hand extended all the way to Xi Jinping so it makes it look like an over eager overwhilling American side to negotiate or to make a deal and that's not the right optic certainly not to be portraying in Asia at this time final question where is this going is China becoming more and more of a threat or is President Biden right to downplay that going forward well I think in the grander scope of History China has always viewed the United States as a threat certainly after Tiananmen Square and it explains why for over 20 years they've double digit growth in their defense spending the only real change is a realization of that late in coming in Washington DC that China is in fact viewing the United States as a comprehensive threat and its military is geared to to taking us on and really it's only been the last few years that we've seemed to have gotten serious about even strengthening our military posture so the danger is real I don't understand the statement by President Biden it certainly is out of context of their own release National strategies in just the last month well Brent thanks so much for coming on that was Heritage Senior research fellow Brent Sadler coming up President Biden's student loan forgiveness program has been

customers to connect with your business watch a demo today at podium.com wire that's podium.com wire Podium let's grow the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan has suffered multiple legal blows in the past week with two separate courts striking it down one as recently as Monday which courts have blocked the plan and what the White House intends to do now is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan I know the rulings against the student loan forgiveness plan have been coming down at a pretty Furious rate the past few days what's the latest hey Georgia uh well yes as John said it's been hit with two pretty damaging rulings in just the last few days so on Thursday a U.S District Court in Texas Struck it down outright and the court called it and I'm just going to quote one of the largest exercises of legislative power without Congressional Authority in the history of the United States but that judge Mark Pittman who is a trump appointee also seemed to offer something of a rebuke for the kind of executive orders that have become pretty commonplace over the last decade so he specifically referenced the famous Obama quote from 2014 about having a pen and a phone to issue executive orders Pittman wrote in this country we are not ruled by an all-powerful executive with a pen and a phone instead we are ruled by a constitution that provides for three distinct and independent branches of government and then on Monday the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals similarly blocked the program they were responding to a suit from Six republican-led States and again the argument in that case was that the executive branch was usurping the powers of the legislative branch because as we know or should know it's Congress that is supposed to hold the powers of the purse and how has the Biden Administration responded to these rulings well they're framing this as Republicans blocking pandemic relief we have to remember that the justification Biden offered for taking over the purse strings from Congress was emergency Authority basically he said that the pandemic had caused undue Financial burdens on people who had federal student loans and then he claimed that he is empowered to forgive their debt as part of his response to the pandemic so this was Jean-Pierre addressing that a couple of weeks ago there are people who uh who who are really squeezed uh by the pandemic and so he wanted to make sure that when we lift up the pause that we gave people a little bit more breathing room and that is where the student debt relief comes from so what does this mean for the borrowers who already applied to get this loan forgiveness so the department justice has already appealed the Texas ruling to the fifth circuit and that could change things but for now the 26 million people who already apply to have their debt forgiven are going to have to wait and that said they were actually already gonna have to wait because of the eighth Circuit Court which had already issued an emergency stay last week to stop any payments from going out but at that point the Biden Administration was at least still accepting applications with these new rulings it's not going to be able to do that anymore either and legal experts are saying that both the Texas and 8th circuit decisions make it more likely that the case ends up in front of the Supreme Court now if that happens any decision could address the constitutionality of these presidential orders at a much broader level and that could re-establish some clearer dividing lines between the executive branch and the legislative branch if so that's something that constructionists are very much going to welcome absolutely thanks Megan anytime that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham Customs and Border Patrol commissioner Chris Magnus resigned on Saturday since he took the helm in December 2021 more than 2 million migrants have crossed the border after a three-day standoff Magnus finally agreed to give up his post here to talk about magnus's forced departure is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim the day after midterm elections President Biden shakes up his homeland security staff what happened there hey Georgia so all this comes at a time when the Biden Administration has been under a lot of fire of the Border crisis that's worse than we've ever seen before it also comes as many people have called for secretary mayorkas to be impeached so late last week we saw reports saying that Magnus was being forced out mayorkas apparently told Magnus Wednesday that he needed to step aside or he would be fired Magnus refused to step down for a few days because he didn't feel that he should he eventually gave in to the pressure and submitted his resignation on Saturday now what do we know about why he was forced out is this just because people are so upset about the Border actually no we don't have a ton of information but according to Anonymous sources this appears to be an interpersonal issue magnus's resignation letter was just four sentences long the White House's statement announcing his resignation was even shorter both gave the bare minimum explanation which was to say that Magnus resigned but there is reason to believe the reports that it was due to interpersonal tension for example last month a group of administration officials vented anonymously to reporters about Magnus they said he was uninterested in his work and cool towards colleagues and routinely skipped important meetings he also hadn't put any effort into building relationships across the Department of Homeland Security Magnus of course contests all these allegations he said that the complaints came from officials who were threatened by the way he operates and who want to keep the status quo but disapproval of Magnus actually seems to be pretty bipartisan Republicans say Magnus is a big part of the open border problem and should have been fired a while ago the border patrol Union issued a scathing statement on Monday it said that Magnus had a long history of anti-border Patrol sentiment the union said quote the entire Biden Administration despises border patrol agents we have little confidence his replacement will be any better now could this possibly be evidence that the president is trying to shift gears on Border policy we'll see Magnus is currently the only official who's been forced out but he's not the only official responsible for overseeing the Border critics have also pointed fingers at mayorkas and vice president Harris they have been in charge of Border policy months longer than Magnus was still magnus's track record isn't good border patrol counted over 2.3 million migrant Encounters in the year he oversaw the agency but if Republicans get their way Magnus may be just the first border official to get booted out as I mentioned a variety of voices on the right are calling for mayorcus's impeachment for his mishandling of the border and some Republicans are promising to take action if they take control of the house this is representative Andy Biggs from Arizona secretary mayorkas needs to be impeached If he if he had any Integrity in my opinion he would have already resigned now final question it was reported on Monday that border states were sending more buses of migrants to Blue cities what do we know about that yeah Philadelphia is preparing for busloads of migrants to arrive in the city but the details still aren't clear Texas governor Greg Abbott usually keeps the details of his migrant trips Under Wraps until the buses are already unloading at their final destination but Philadelphia believes something is up a spokesperson for mayor Jim Kinney said City officials were warned by a partner organization down in Texas not from a Texas official Abbott's busing program has already shipped thousands of migrants to Washington D.C New York City and Chicago while at the very least maybe the staff shake-up can make room for someone a little more effective Tim thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wire's Tim Pierce other stories we're tracking this week some Outlets including decision desk

    "PhjVOlsyp7U": "[Music] in an unscheduled National address Wednesday evening President Biden sounded the alarm again about what he claims is the threat to democracy posed by so-called election deniers this is also the first election since the events of January 6th when the armed angry mob stormed the U.S Capitol I wish I wish I could say the assault on a democracy ended that day but I cannot we discussed the president's polarizing speech and its implications just days from the midterms I'm Georgia Howe with daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley it's Thursday November 3rd and this is morning wire Republicans are rapidly gaining ground in New Hampshire where they could pick up an unexpected senate seat we unveil our exclusive poll with Trafalgar group and a surge in cases of the

b-o-l-l-a-n-d-branch.com promo code wire [Music] President Biden addressed the nation last night in an unscheduled speech from DC's Union Station joining us to discuss the president's remarks is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce all right Tim so in this speech we heard a lot about what Democrats call election deniers and the end of American democracy neither of which is new from the president but this is a notable moment nonetheless first walk us through the speech yeah this wasn't exactly new ground the address echoed a lot of what we've heard from Democrats and especially the White House's election season American democracy is at stake and mega Republicans are the chief threat if the wrong people are elected the Integrity of American elections may be irreparably compromised one new Wrinkle in the speech was the president's attempt to draw parallel between the attack on Paul Pelosi Nancy Pelosi's husband to Capital rioters here's part of what he said the assailant ended up using a hammer to smash Paul's skull after the assailant entered the home asking where's Nancy where's Nancy those are the very same words used by the mob when they stormed the United States capital on January the 6th when they broke windows kicked in the doors brutally attacked law enforcement roam the Carters hunting for officials and erected Gallows to hang the former vice president Mike Pence he then tied those rioters to so-called Maga Republicans and painted a picture of America as a country that continues to be under assault by those Republicans yet now extreme maggot Republicans aim to question not only the legitimacy of past elections but elections being held now and into the future the extreme Maga element of the Republican party which is a minority that party as I said earlier but it's this driving force is trying to succeed where they failed in 2020 to suppress the right of Voters and subvert the electoral system itself along with once again condemning Trump the speech eventually shifted into an overt get out the vote pitch with Biden giving the specific litmus test of the candidate not being what he labeled an election denier I hope you'll ask a simple question of each candidate you might vote for will that person accept the legitimate will of the American people of people voting in his district or her District will that person accept the outcome of the election win or lose all right so there we have the president saying the Republicans that Democrats label election deniers should be voted down now this address seemed put together rather quickly was announced the same day it was given what was the White House's goal here well it's the election Republicans have polled quite well in the past month Biden wants to change that momentum less than a week before election day White House officials really played up the major theme of democracy in danger ahead of the speech they also said the setting was picked intentionally the Union Station is just a few blocks from the U.S Capitol and Biden used the capital right on January 6 last year to highlight the stakes in the election all right so with all the talk about Trump and the Optics there the White House appears to be banking on you know that former president to motivate their base again right that's been a point of criticism from Republicans but I need something to deflect from his own unpopularity and he's probably worried about his support in his own party if 2022 is a big way for the GOP more than a few Democrats have punted when asked if Biden should run for president in 2024 they know he's unpopular and if he's seen as the reason Democrats lost big he'll face some stiff resistance to Leading the party past the next election you can see this feeling building among Democrats and Battleground States already Senator Mark Kelly in Arizona Congressman Tim Ryan in Ohio and others are running as Maverick candidates with a track record of standing up to Biden in Kelly's case he's voted with Biden 95 of the time meanwhile the president has generally stayed out of Swing States and let popular proxies really try to motivate Democrats to get out and vote right just in the past week we saw former president Obama campaigning for Gretchen Whitmer and other Democrats in Michigan Whitmer is in a tight race now with Republican Tudor Dixon for the Governor's seat at the same time Biden was down in Florida campaigning for Charlie Christ is running leagues behind Governor Ron DeSantis right now so that's an example of Biden campaigning in a race that's not very competitive right not even close attempt thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wires Tim Pierce coming up Republicans gain the advantage in New Hampshire are you tired of being the

wire and Trafalgar shows Republicans taking the lead in a crucial Battleground state that was once written off as a Democrat stronghold here were the latest numbers from the New Hampshire Senate races daily wire senior editor Kevin Phillips Kevin we're getting our last look at polls before the final votes are cast this Tuesday what are we saying well we're seeing Republican Don bolduck with a slim lead over Democrat incumbent Maggie Hassan right now he's up 47 to 45.7 in our latest Trafalgar poll now keep in mind back in September Hassan had a double-digit lead and a lot of Republicans sort of gave up on New Hampshire but throughout the last month Bolduc has slowly crept up in the polls first coming within three back in early October and now taking the lead and it's also worth noting this is now the second poll in two days that shows him up another from Saint Anselm College has him leading 48-47 so the Trafalgar poll is not an outlier at this point and it's another sign of clear momentum for republicans in the granite state yeah it looks like it so how has balduck been able to gain so much ground so quickly well one big factor is that he's been the Republican candidate for fewer than 50 days now because the primaries in New Hampshire are so late Bulldog did not become the nominee until September 15th that meant that Hassan had the advantage of spending all summer campaigning to general election voters while Bolduc was simply trying to survive the primary and it was a tough primary at that the Republican establishment in New Hampshire as well as D.C spent millions of dollars in the primary trying to prevent him from winning they felt like he wasn't electable enough and the Republican Governor Chris Nunu even went as far as calling him a conspiracy theory extremist But ultimately he did end up emerging from the primary and Republican leadership has really come around on him lately right yeah it's uh easy to come around on someone when they could potentially decide the balance of the Senate and after Bulldog won the Primary Republican groups including the powerful National Republican senatorial committee started investing millions of dollars into his race and he's going to need that money as of the last campaign filing Hassan's campaign had brought in almost 20 times more fundraising dollars than Bolduc she's at 38 million he was at 2.2 million and because of that discrepancy bolduck did not air his first TV ad until October 6th but since then he's really caught on with voters in state now we've been tracking early voting totals in other states to try to get a feel for who's in the lead but what are we seeing in New Hampshire while other states like Pennsylvania and Georgia allow early voting for basically the entire month before Election Day New Hampshire does not allow it at all but instead offers absentee ballots and even then only in limited circumstances so it seems that an upset very well could be brewing in the state of New Hampshire which would just be crippling for Democrats if they want to hold the Senate yeah it certainly would Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips [Music] viruses including flu and RSV are spiking across the U.S and scientists are pointing to the pandemic lockdowns as a reason for the spike here to give us the details is daily wire's Charlotte Pence Bond so Charlotte what are we seeing this flu season well we're seeing a real explosion in cases and in some states the number of RSV cases in particular is putting a major strain on pediatric departments at hospitals this put out new estimates late last month that show there have been at least 880 000 flu cases around 7 000 hospitalizations and 360 deaths last month through October 22nd typically flu gets worse in the colder months from December to February but the agency said the southwest and South Central areas of the country are seeing the majority of cases right now the numbers are the most we've seen in over a decade the cumulative hospitalizations rate is 1.5 hospitalizations for 100 000 people that data comes from the cdc's examination of around 13 states and that's the highest rate they've seen for this time of year since 2010 to 2011 and RSV the respiratory synthesisral virus is also causing concerns specifically among parents since it can be really harmful for children hospitals are seeing a rise in cases around the country a recent CNN analysis showed that RSV cases started being observed this spring and are now 60 percent higher than the highest week of 2021 but they said it's probably even more these are piling on top of each other which is another issue Physicians are now saying that a triple threat of viruses could be coming of flu RSV and covid now why are we seeing such an uptick in fluent RSV this year while some scientists think it may have to do with pandemic lockdowns and their effect on immunity it's called an immunity Gap this summer two scientists in particular Dr Kevin messicar and Rachel Baker wrote about this in the Lancet medical journal they say that as lockdowns kept people at home kids and adults in their Circle weren't exposed to viruses since people weren't getting sick they also weren't building up immunity with RSV in particular babies often get immunity from their mom's breast milk but even the moms weren't around anyone with a virus for periods of time as most people were either keeping a distance from one another or flat out quarantining now not all areas of the country locked down equally or for the same amount of time so is there direct evidence that the places that lock down harder have more of an immunity Gap well around mid-october hospitals were noting spikes in at least 33 states with notable spikes in California Illinois Massachusetts North Carolina and Rhode Island so it's not completely conclusive but the trend does hint that lockdowns may have been a factor now for people who are not familiar with RSV can you tell us about the symptoms according to the CDC symptoms are runny nose decrease in appetite coughing fever sneezing and wheezing lots of children get this virus and in most cases it resolves within a week or so but if a child is having difficulty breathing has shallow or quick breathing is dehydrated or if their skin is turning blue that's assigned to go to the hospital all right well Charlotte thanks so much for reporting thanks for having me that's daily wires Charlotte Pence Bond another story we're tracking this week the Parkland Mass shooter has

    "LfL4Z-emRhs": "it's one thing when you come after a mama it's another thing when you come after her kids so this event we're heading to mamas for desantis we're going to hear first lady casey desantis talk about the importance of moms getting out for elections mom's going out to vote those gas prices are high and madison looks at me and she goes that's joe biden so we traveled down here to miami this week to talk to florida voters to talk to these moms and hear what they think about these upcoming midterm elections we want to hear what they have to say i think the most important thing is parenting and being a parent at home and educating them with what your family's values are to protect the innocence of our children i mean that's when people don't know how strong a woman can be and a woman's vote is very important we're down here today at bay 13 a brewery here in miami it was a packed house today lots of mamas lots of grandmas who are in there talking about the issues that are most important to them and the most important to mamas here in florida and across the nation everywhere i go a mama says how can i help support the desantis agenda how can i support what he's done on education how can i get involved [Music] governor desantis handling of the pandemic has garnered huge amounts of support from parents he locked down the state later and opened up earlier insisted on keeping schools open and refused to instate a mask or vaccine mandate and when the state was made aware of some of the progressive ideology being taught in schools he quickly took action and i think it really was kovid that allowed a lot of these moms to peer into the classroom for the first time and to see what was being taught without their consent and behind their backs as she speaks to the women at the mamas for desantis events first lady casey desantis points to her husband's many accomplishments and she urges mothers to read and circulate the governor's freedom agenda florida's first lady sat down with us to fill us in on her plans to rally mothers you've been doing a lot of work rallying these mamas to come out to vote can you share a little bit about what that's been like you know why is because mamas are fired up i think everybody looks back and they remember what 2018 was like right it was a nail biter it got down to 32 000 votes a half a percentage point between the way florida has gone which is a bastion of freedom and a light to the entire world versus what would have happened had the other person had been elected and it would have been worse than places like california illinois michigan and new york here's how the governor has defined that relationship between florida and the states that florida's first lady mentions during covent when people would come in from california or new york they would say that it was like being in a different country we really served as america's west berlin in many respects and so we know what's on the ballot freedom is on the ballot and one of the biggest groups of folks that's going to help us get to where we ultimately want to be with a slam dunk election or mamas right and you're a mother of three yourself right yes so as a mother can you share with us what are the issues that are most important to mothers when they're voting there's a lot i mean one of which is public safety right you see a lot of these other states defunding and demonizing law enforcement in florida we have the blues back you look at education one of the things i'm the most passionate about we should not be indoctrinating these kids we should be educating them and so you look at the anti-crt legislation that was passed by the legislature and signed by the governor the transparency in education which is one of the most important things the mothers and grandmothers we spoke with both before and after the event strongly praised governor desantis's efforts to protect children's education here's elizabeth he is putting all the care in the school boards he's protecting what the teachers are learning in a school and give us the right as a parent to have the the ability to teach our children what is right and what is wrong he is respecting that one mother we met myra tells us that her number one issue as a voter and as an attorney is safety we don't want our city and our and florida to uh to be anything like other states where crime is rampant in the streets people are getting killed beaten up another mother marisol said her number one issue is protecting children in schools that issue is very important because the moms are concerned that their kids are getting indoctrinated in schools instead of actually getting educated over the last year we've seen desantis act to protect education and to fight woke ideology in schools on several occasions such as to stop the wrongs to our kids and employees act or the stop woke act which protects schools colleges and corporations from critical race theory ideology no taxpayer dollars should be used to teach our kids to hate our country or to hate each other and if parents aren't getting that he's empowered them to take legal action now families have the right to be able to sue a school district if they're not being transparent in what they're teaching their your kids or what's being put in your children's library we as a woman we say you don't mess with our children these are my children and we fight the coronavirus pandemic has significantly changed the way that parents look at political candidates and elections one new york times report suggests that many parents are becoming single issue voters obsessively focused on preventing coveted mandates and lockdowns and heavily skeptical of public health officials why is media we should be skeptical of the uh quote health officials during covet because everything that they told us was basically a lie i mean they said wear the masks it'll stop transmission take the vaccine and you won't get sick and you won't transmit so i think parents are very upset by that the other thing were these mask mandates when you look at the masks i mean fauci from the very beginning he knew that these things didn't work it's like putting a chain-link fence in front of a gnat thinking that you're going to stop it but they never acknowledged the ramifications of what those masks were doing to our kids the emotional toll that it was taking because never before have we taken away the ability for kids to be able to see and receive a smile and so now they're admitting to the developmental delays kids aren't able to speak as well they started some of those critical years in kindergarten first grade with a mask on their face and not the ability to be able to see their teacher the kids were coming home and they had swapped masks that's not very sanitary there's actually a group of moms in florida who took those masks and brought them to a lab to have them tested casey desantis is referring to back in june 2021 when parents sent their children's masks to the university of florida mass spectrometry research and education center those masks tested positive for at least 11 pathogens and they found all kinds of bacteria and e coli and all of these things that were in there it was an atrocity what a lot of folks did to those kids and i am so proud of the governor to stand strong with no vax mandates and no mask mandates from the very beginning if you're trying to deny kids a proper in-person education i'm going to stand in your way and i'm going to stand up for the kids in florida if you're trying to restrict people impose mandates if you're trying to ruin their jobs and their livelihoods and their small business if you are trying to lock people down i am standing in your way and i'm standing for the people of florida other big moves from the governor he's banned late-term abortions and biological males from participating in women's sports or using women's bathrooms now he's pushing to protect minors from transgender surgeries you saw the other day the governor went and suspended a state attorney who wasn't upholding his oath to the constitution the u.s and the state another looming concern for parents radical highly sexualized gender ideology woven into their children's school curriculums and often without their knowledge and i'm so glad that covet opened up their eyes to actually see what was going on in the school system and it's concerning it's the books that they're actually putting out there it's what they're teaching them subtly because some of it is not in the books i think the governor said it best that are we doing so well with reading writing and arithmetic that we think that we need to be injecting gender ideology down the throat of a four-year-old we don't and so that's why they've really passed the legislation where we have parental rights in education media activists and democrats use the phrase gender affirming care often in the context of minors to mask the more grisly details of transgender surgeries hormones and puberty blockers why does it use this phrase it's not gender affirming care i think that that's another talking point from the left but if you look at the warning from the fda for something like puberty blockers those puberty blockers can cause brain swelling and permanent blindness and that's just what we know about these things but they're giving it to these kids in experimental form and then you talk about performing these procedures of double mastectomies and castrating these young boys knowing that this stuff this gender dysphoria resolves itself then they're forced to live with this for the rest of their life i agree with a hundred percent what the governor said about the doctors who are performing those surgeries they should be sued here's governor desantis in early august you don't disfigure 10 12 13 year old kids uh based on gender dysphoria 80 of it resolves anyways by the time they get older so why would you be doing this i think these doctors need to get sued for what's happening i'm sorry why is this being pushed right now your guess is as good as mine i think it's just all part of an agenda that the left is pushing but i'll tell you the american people and moms especially don't like it and we don't like it when it's being forced in front of our kids particularly our kindergartners without our consent or knowledge it's wrong and in florida it ain't happening i don't remember ever having a teacher tell me who i liked who i didn't or you know if i thought this was my friend i there's no place for you there is to teach you know the peer pressure is very very you know very great with youngsters growing up and while the state seeks to safeguard children from extreme ideologies florida's first lady is focusing on supporting kids who do not have both parents particularly those children without fathers one of the things that the governor and myself have been very invested in is the fatherhood crisis we're seeing across the nation we've invested 61 million dollars in a lot of mentorship programs i have an initiative called hope florida where we're working primarily with struggling single moms to provide their kids mentors to be able to facilitate the opportunity for them to live up to their god-given potential in the american dream by having a father figure government dissenters first lady is doing a wonderful job to take care of the family our children and the generations to come government can't and shouldn't fix all problems but honestly if there is something that we can do we can incentivize mentorship for a lot of these kids to be able to have that connection with a father figure casey desantis is hope florida a pathway to prosperity is an initiative through which their care navigators provide help to floridians who submit requests for assistance through what's called the care portal she hopes the community-based effort will spur the faith community to carry on the work that the government has started so let's say sally who's coming into the system through the department of children families she is a struggling single mom she doesn't have bunk beds she doesn't have mattresses her kids are having a hard time eating she can't put food on the table what a hope navigator will do will take those needs input them into the system and then a real-time alert will go to those participating faith and community-based organizations and what happens then is th those institutions can deliver those needs directly to sally's doorstep so there's a connection that has been made between sally and the participating faith organizations and they cannot unsee what they saw and those faith-based communities are not going to let sally or her kids go hungry again many attribute glenn young's victory in virginia to the parent-led rebellion against ideological content in schools team desantis seeks to also mobilize parents who are angry about leftist attempts at subverting education but rather than building off a shocking incident like the loudoun county sexual assault case exposed by the daily wire the governor's team is creating organic momentum through events like the one we attended the women's vote is very important i don't know if you know that how important the women's vote is but you're gonna see it you're going to see it if we get all women out there voting we got it i'm 24 7 in little havana making sure nobody is going to walk little havana governor desantis has had a very aggressive approach in dealing with these different culture war issues like transgender surgeries for children they term abortions sex education in schools gender ideology a lot of governors are afraid to wade into these issues and they're worried that it'll affect voters but it seems like down here in miami governor desantis approach to these issues is only building momentum i think it's really important that we as mamas show up in droves do the sentiments we heard today align with the rest of the country is virginia a bellwether we're going to keep asking and we'll keep you updated also be sure to comment and let us know where we should go next [Music]",

to skip the guesswork and find the best deals near you that's carzing.com wire in a surprising turn Democrats were declared victorious in the critical Nevada Senate race Saturday despite the Republican candidate holding the lead heading into the weekend the development ensures Democrat control of the Senate and is drawing outrage from Republicans who appeared well on their way to victory in the race here with more on that Nevada reversal and the latest from other races that remain up in the air as daily wire's senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot a shift in Nevada over the weekend that has ended up being pivotal for control of the Senate what can you tell us about that race well when we last spoke Republican Challenger Adam lack salt seemed to be in a good spot against Democrat incoming Catherine Cortez masto he was ahead by a few thousand votes heading into Friday and Republicans were confident that he would end up on top Senator Lindsey Graham for example all but declared Victory saying quote there is no mathematical way laxalt loses but then a batch of 27 000 votes came in from the state's largest county which includes Las Vegas and lacksaw's Lead was cut to 800 votes and then beginning Saturday night and into Sunday with 98 of the vote counted and lacks all behind by around 6 000 votes numerous Outlets including ABC News declared the Democrat Catherine Cortez masto the winner now it wasn't all bad news for republicans in Nevada as Joe Lombardo was able to unseat Democrat incumbent Governor Steve sislock that was the party's first Governor's flip of the 2022 cycle but obviously it's bittersweet given the loss in the senate race right now the other Senate race that was undecided is out in Arizona where the vote count really came to a standstill kind of like Nevada what's the latest there with the senate race and also that Governor's race Republican Blake Masters appeared to be gaining on Democrat incumbent Mark Kelly as votes started to trickle in but on Friday with about 80 percent of the vote in the Associated Press declared Mark Kelly the winner at the time he had around a five-point lead the race for governor though is still a true toss-up we've still got around 10 percent of the vote left to count and Republican Kerry lake is within 30 000 votes of democrat Katie Hobbs now Lake's team says they're confident the remaining votes are coming from republican-controlled parts of the state but again it's still anyone's guess who actually comes out on top and many Republicans are increasingly skeptical when the vote counting gets this delayed yeah to that point the question on a lot of people's minds why are some states waiting so long to declare winner yeah that is the million dollar question right now so in Nevada for example every voter is issued a mail-in ballot whether they request it or not you actually have to opt out of it to not get one in Nevada and the state will accept ballots that arrive as late as Saturday so four days after election day in Arizona where according to the Washington Post and this is a direct quote printers used to produce ballots on demand failed at about a third of polling locations on Election Day officials say it could be another 10 days before the final votes are counted but because of some of those errors at polling places and malfunctions it's even more backed up than usual so potentially 10 more days yeah now that delay has raised a lot of concerns from voters especially Republicans tell us about that well there have been a number of incidents that went viral online and Drew outrage from Republican voters and officials for example beyond that printer outage in Arizona there was also a live stream camera that had been monitoring vote counting in Washoe County that went black during the middle of the night now that County includes the City of Reno and helped swing the election to Democrats at the very end the county released a statement saying quote we know that our election live stream cameras went dark overnight we investigated what happened and how to prevent it happening again but not not really the answer is that a lot of Republicans were looking for that's not a good look what's been the Democrat response to all this so democrats for their part have been warning in the weeks leading up to the election that final results in many states would take a few days and that the reason Democrats often Take the Lead at the very end is because their voters are typically concentrated in more urban areas that take longer to send in results and also remember they dominate among early voters but that has done little to alleviate frustration from Republicans Republicans say that allowing days for votes to come in opens the door to fraud and undermines the confidence of Voters in the final outcome they point to large states like Florida that reformed their election laws over the last two years and had votes counted within just a few hours on Tuesday essentially Republicans say that it should be election day and not election week or month now these delays are also impacting the house as well yep we'll get into the house more later this week but the bottom line is we still do not know who's got the majority in the house because about 20 districts are still counting votes yeah well we'll have you back on as more of these belated

for bankruptcy and is facing criminal investigations the implosion is bringing up questions about the company's CEO who was the Democrats second largest donor in 2022. here to explain what happened with FTX and what it means politically is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan the entire Financial world is talking about FTX right now but I think most people including myself have a hard time tracking with these crypto stories what exactly happened here so ftx's CEO Sam bankman freed was seen as sort of this wonderkind he's only 30 years old and he set up both FTX and a separate hedge fund called Alameda that has been making huge loans and donations to all sorts of organizations so on November 2nd a crypto news Outlet obtained a leaked document that showed the close ties between those two companies and the question became whether bankman freed or SBF as he's known in the crypto world has been using money that customers had invested with FTX to fund alameda's Financial activities now what that did was cause FTX investors to try to pull out their Investments and of course the cash wasn't there that allowed them to do so so what you had then was a collapse and a filing for bankruptcy and since then it's hit all kinds of other Financial companies who were invested in FTX and overall it's just caused a really sharp downturn in cryptocurrencies this was Brian Armstrong CEO of the crypto trading platform coinbase talking about it on the all-in podcast I had to scratch my head a bunch of times and I was like where is this guy getting all this liquidity because he was like buying nine percent of Robin Hood he was putting like a billion dollars into this he was donating to all these politicians and I was like I it did not make sense to me where he was getting all this cash so now the doj the SEC and authorities in the Bahamas where FTX is headquartered are investigating for potential Financial crimes and they've also Frozen some of the company's assets okay so a lot of the discussion though about FTX is now focused on its role as a Democrat donor tell us more about that yeah you know a big part of this story is that FDX was considered a respectable crypto to give you one example Formula One racing and Major League Baseball both had sponsorship deals with FTX but as you said the biggest Scandal here is connected to Democrat politics so bankman freed donated to a number of Senators and Congress people overseeing the commodity Futures Trading commission that's the cftc and that's the agency in charge of regulating the crypto industry now a little bit of that money went to some Republicans who also sat on that commission but the vast majority of it went to Democrats including and especially actually President Biden so bankman freed was a huge donor in the midterm elections the second largest individual donor in fact estimates put his total contribution to Democrat candidates at around 40 million he gave 6 million to the Democrats House Majority pack he gave more than 5 million to Biden's 2020 campaign and that made him the president's second largest individual donor as well behind only George Soros and some of the accusations surrounding this are pretty complex and they're just now coming to light including connections to Ukraine but what we're hearing is that only days after Biden pledged to send billions of taxpayer dollars to Ukraine FTX partnered with Ukrainian government to process funds so the issue is whether FTX funneled some of that funding to Alameda and again that was bankman Freed's hedge fund that was supposed to be a separate company if he then turned around and used it for political donations then we're talking about a whole other level of fraud there's still a lot of threads left to pull on in what is turning out to be a very complex story right extremely complex well we're going to continue to monitor it Megan thanks for reporting yeah my pleasure that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham [Music] after Glenn younkin's surprise win in Virginia last year many pundits predicted a parent Coalition would sweep Republicans to victory in the midterms while election night did not deliver the overwhelming Victory Republicans had hoped for on a national level conservative School Board candidates flipped seats across the country the GOP victories signal that parental rights were a big factor in voters decisions in places like Florida Daily wire investigative reporter lordy is here with more details for us all right Marie not everyone has paid as much attention to these races as the national ones but tell us about these conservative School Board victories sure so first off in Florida all six of the school board candidates Florida Governor Ron DeSantis endorsed won their runoff races this means that of the 30 local education candidates DeSantis backed this year a total of 24 have now won their races over the summer conservative School Board candidates including some endorsed by DeSantis won their races and flipped school boards to conservative majorities in five counties including some traditionally blue areas like Miami-Dade as well as Sarasota all of this points to a larger trend of conservatives gaining the upper hand in the education debate keep in mind Florida has been the epicenter of the education culture war in some ways after Governor DeSantis signed Landmark parental rights legislation earlier this year as we've reported here back in March the Santa signed a bill that prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade so big gains in Florida for GOP backed School Board candidates that's perhaps not surprising as we've noted how DeSantis and his party really swept Florida away in their own sort of Red Wave but what about other states did we see similar Trends in other places yes in Michigan Maryland and Indiana Republicans flipped school boards to give them conservative majorities as well that's according to two parental rights groups who endorsed many of the Victorious candidates one of those groups called 1776 project pack claims to have officially flipped 100 School boards since November last year the group's candidates also won in Oklahoma and Ohio the other group moms for Liberty said its candidates won in Indiana South Carolina and North Carolina now we don't often hear about school board wins after national elections but this year is clearly different there's a movement and more of a political Focus now on this why are things shifting on this issue well this is yet another sign that parents are becoming an activated voter block we got the first indication of this last fall when Glenn Younkin flipped Virginia and there was some question as to whether that would fizzle out it's also a sign that conservatives efforts to regain a foothold in local governance may be paying off it remains to be seen whether this level of energy will continue through to 2024. yeah that'll be an interesting Trend to track all right thanks for reporting thanks John that's a daily wire investigative reporter mireta Lordi thank

surprising Trends including which demographics are on Pace to decide the country's future I'm Georgia Howe with daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley it's October 18th this is morning wire deadly attacks against police officers have surged over the past two years Rising nearly 50 percent since 2020. these officers sign up to do a job is to protect and serve but not to seek gunfire and as election day nears more and more democratic leaders are distancing themselves from President Biden even in deep blue States like New York we really are looking for a federal response to this thanks

alarm bells for Democrats and bolstering Republican hopes of a red wave joining us to discuss is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips so Kevin we've got a significant poll here that's really caused a stir in Washington the top-line findings from this poll can you summarize them for us yeah this one had a lot of people talking so the main headline here is that any momentum Democrats had over the summer is gone according to the New York Times 49 percent of Voters now say they prefer Republicans ahead of midterms while just 45 percent say they want Democrats in charge the poll also found that men favored Republicans 50 to 45 which isn't all that surprising given recent Trends but it gets interesting we look at women they've typically leaned left over the last few cycles and right now it's a dead even 47-47 in the poll and it gets even worse when we zoom in if you look at female Independence in September they favor Democrats by 14 points now just one month later Independent Women favor Republicans get this by 18 percentage points that's a remarkable swing it is and it happened very quickly especially when you consider the fact that Democrats have been really honing in and campaigning almost non-stop on abortion which they were hoping would lock in the female vote according to this poll at least that strategy does not appear to be working it's also worth pointing out the more you dig into the numbers nearly every demographic shows a shift from Democrats to Republicans yeah what did we see from other demographics well one of the big stories over the last year has been whether Democrats would hold on among minority voters remember we started to see signs of waning support there 34 percent of Latinos say they'll likely vote Republican that's compared to 29 percent who backed Trump in 2016 and roughly 32 percent in 2020. likewise 18 of black voters say they intend to vote Republican that's compared to eight percent in 2016 and 12 in 2020 so a clear shift there towards Republicans what about issues doing know what's driving this shift toward Republicans yeah as you could probably guess the major takeaway here is that people are still very worried about the economy this poll found that 44 of respondents viewed the economy as their main issue that's five times more people saying the economy than any other issue and as we've talked about on the show voters who say the economy is their top priority tend to split towards the GOP for example those who said inflation was their top issue favored Republicans 64 to 30. and while Democrats do lead significantly among voters who care about other issues like abortion and climate change the problem for Democrats right now is that most voters are not financially insulated enough to prioritize social issues right now yeah speaking of being financially insulated the times piece also touched on the growing class divide between the two parties what did we learn there right so this poll was yet another indicator that Democratic support is becoming increasingly isolated to wealthy Urban enclaves one of the biggest divides is between those who have a bachelor's degree and those who don't 55 of those with the Bachelors plan to vote Democrat compared to 41 percent who plan to vote Republican and of those who don't have a degree it's almost the inverse 54 plan to go Republican while 39 plan on voting Democrat the only exception to all that is black voters but as we discussed their support of Democrats is also starting to soften so all around look we've got more positive news for Republicans after a summer where it definitely appeared they were losing ground yeah it seems they have more reason to be optimistic Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Kevin

number of officers killed by gunfire this year on track to be the deadliest total since 2016. here to discuss the increasingly dangerous atmosphere for law enforcement is daily wire reporter Tim Pierce so Tim a scary trend for law enforcement what kind of numbers are we looking at well at least 56 police officers have been killed by gunfire so far this year that's a 14 increase over the same time last year and a 45 percent increase over the pace set in 2020. that number includes cases like accidental gunfire but nearly half of the deaths are a result of ambushes in which officers were targeted because they are police Joe Lombardo who serves the sheriff for Nevada's Clark County and is running to be the state's next Governor acknowledge the growing danger against police officers after one Las Vegas cop was killed responding to a domestic disturbance call last week we are seeing an increase in violence Associated against our officers on a daily basis and last week in Bristol Connecticut two officers were killed and a third was injured and what police say was an ambush the group of officers responding to a 9-1-1 call for what they believed was a domestic dispute police said the responding officers were caught in a trap that resulted in two of their deaths so these individuals intentionally called the police to the home with the plan of killing them yes according to the Fraternal Order of Police from the start of this year through September 63 Ambush Style attacks have taken place against police officers resulting in 69 officers wounded and 24 killed in the first nine months of 2021 the number of attacks was similar in 75 Ambush style attacks 72 officers were wounded and 21 were killed so if this all started in 2020 are they linking this to the defund movement yeah or at least to the anti-police rhetoric that intensified around that time this latest spike in violence against police appears to trace back to George Floyd's death in May of 2020 and the escalation of the thief on the police movement the movement was based on the perception that police are systemically racist and a danger to Black communities as you can imagine that kind of bad publicity and negative attention has been a real challenge for officer morale many in law enforcement felt that they had been abandoned by City officials who participated in the marches against law enforcement some cities such as Los Angeles San Francisco Seattle and New York City when as far as cutting their police budgets many of those cities later reverse course after backlash from police in the community as violent crime has surged across the country now you mentioned that this has been terrible for officer morale do we have any hard data on things like officer attrition yeah we have some FBI data shows that from 2020 to 2021 the number of officers nationally fell from 719 000 to 688 that's despite Rising crime and aggressive recruiting bonuses being offered during that same period but another sign of low morale is Officer suicides and this was already an issue a 2019 study found that police have the highest suicide rate of any profession and they are three times as likely to die by Suicide than on the job part of that is access to Firearms but it's also due to the stress of the job but there hasn't been a concerted effort to track officer suicides until this year the FBI began collecting data this past January to track this but their report has not been made public yet however at least one department San Antonio PD made news last week when their fifth officer in seven months died by Suicide we don't know the exact circumstances surrounding the officer's death but a trend like that is concerning for those deaths were active duty police officers and one had resigned just two weeks prior to his suicide San Antonio Police Chief William McManus addressed the officer's death earlier this month take away from me right now is and what's on my heart is what more can we do and what did we miss that's what's that's what is eating while it's a very high pressure job Tim thanks for reporting thanks for having me that was daily wire's Tim Pierce the Pole's tightening and Midterm races prominent Democrats are distancing themselves from the Biden Administration on key issues like immigration New York Governor Kathy hokel recently called on the Biden Administration to take ownership of the crisis at the border here with the details is daily wires Michael Whitaker Michael welcome so what's this trend you're seeing hey Georgia happy to be here now this trend is manifested in several races but with governor hulkel in particular it is really remarkable as an about face from someone who just last year described herself as a Biden Democrat but there are a lot of remarkable things in the upcoming midterm elections deep blue States like New York and Oregon States and Republicans have not won a Statewide election in decades now seem to have competitive Governor's races and Republican Lee zildan has been consistently closing the gap of Governor hokel with some recent polls putting him only a few points behind while abortion and the economy are at the Forefront of most voters Minds crime and immigration have also consistently ranked as top issues and major vulnerabilities for Democrats polls suggested voters trust Republicans over Democrats by about 10 points on both those issues hokel and other New York Democrats have recently come under mounting pressure for Rising crime and The Surge of illegal immigration reference now is this directly related to the migrants arriving in New York coming on those buses from the border states yes it is but New Yorkers are also very concerned about the situation of the Border illegal immigration has been surging over the past two years record numbers of Migrant councils recorded in the fiscal years of 2021 and 2022. 1.7 and 2. million in those years respectively to put that into perspective there were more Encounters in fiscal year 2022 than in all four years of the Trump Administration combined Republican Governors like Greg Abbott of Texas Doug Ducey in Arizona and even Florida's drawn DeSantis have blamed the inflow on Democratic policies and have been busing thousands of migrants to Sanctuary cities like New York City Washington DC and Chicago in addition to the handful sense to the elite Coastal Enclave amorphous Vineyard critics of the busing have called it political theater but the strategy certainly seems to be appealing to the Right audience City officials are now calling the situation a crisis and pressuring the federal government to address the issue more aggressively now we've talked about hokel in New York but is this a trend we're seeing in other blue States in some in some purplish areas as well for a while now we've seen congressmen in blue border districts like Henry Cuellar of Texas talking about this and as far back as April vulnerable incumbent Senators like Nevada's Catherine cortes-masto and George's Raphael Warnock were criticizing Biden's border policy Nevada and Georgia are what I'd call Purple to Blue but perhaps the most forceful condemnation in recent memory came from senatorial hopeful Tim Ryan of Ohio who's in a tight race against JD Vance in a state that's trended increasingly red in recent years the vice president Kamala Harris said just last month that the southern border is secure Kamala Harris is absolutely wrong midterm elections are often treated as referendums on the party in power and as the party's leader President Biden is simply not popular right now his approval rating is hovered in the low 40s for the last few months it was in the 30s during parts of the summer and unlike other polarizing presidents like Donald Trump or Barack Obama he just doesn't have much enthusiasm within the party base a recent ABC poll suggested that the majority of Democrats 56 percent would prefer that someone else was at the top of their ticket in 2024 4. Biden is not a popular campaign surrogate and for many incumbents it's easier to run away from him and his policies than to run with him well it'll be interesting to see if this trend holds for the next few weeks Michael thanks for reporting thanks for having me George that was daily wires Michael Whitaker [Music] stories we're tracking this week the doj is recommending a six-month prison sentence and a two hundred thousand dollar fine for former Trump aide Steve Bannon due to his failure to comply with a subpoena from the January 6th committee South Korean boy band BTS will perform mandatory military service representatives of the group said Monday the oldest member gin will be the first to serve the band is set to reconvene again around 2025 after fulfilling their service commitment researchers at Boston University have reportedly developed a new strain of covid-19 with a mortality rate of 80 percent in rodent tests many have expressed concerns that this gain of function research could unleash a horrific new pandemic and Kanye West has reportedly come to a deal to purchase parlor the conservative social media site thanks for listening to morning wire we created this show to bring more balance to the National conversation if you love our show and you stand with our mission please consider subscribing leaving us a five-star rating and a message we love those and most importantly sharing our podcast with a friend thanks for waking up with us we'll be back this afternoon with more of the news you need to know [Music]",

    "yZvaKDS3DyY": "[Music] in a second and highly anticipated decision regarding coveted vaccines for children a CDC panel voted unanimously on Thursday to add coveted vaccinations to the childhood vaccine schedule that is a complete departure from how the FDA historically has approved any drug especially for children we separate fact from fiction I'm daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley with Georgia Howe it's Friday October 21st and this is morning wire more national attention is focusing on Nevada where several key races are coming down to the wire what unique circumstances are motivating Nevada and voters and why is the GOP gaining ground in the state and Americans trust in news media has cratered but it's one side of the political aisle that's really leading the way in the

unanimously Thursday to add coveted vaccinations to the routine immunization schedule for children contrary to popular belief the agency cannot mandate schools to require coveted vaccinations for enrollment but states do lean heavily on these guidelines when determining which vaccines they want to require daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham is here to detail what impact the cdc's vote will have and what we can expect going forward so Megan obviously the big question on most parents Minds is going to be does this mean my kids will have to be vaccinated to attend school what's the answer there so that's a little bit of a complicated question technically The Advisory panel voted to recommend adding coveted vaccines to the schedule the CDC doesn't have the power to mandate vaccines but a lot of states do use the cdc's recommendations to set policy so we're going to see federalism kick into gear here with some states requiring and some states not in fact I spoke to Dr Homan Hamati a pediatric clinical trialist and chief medical officer of a biopharmaceutical company called by Luma about that there's a major problem here because they're they're basically giving a green light for Governors and school districts to demand that children receive this vaccine as a condition of attending school but at the same time are doing it based on extremely weak data I think this is going to cause a tremendous amount of uproar I think a lot of the concern is Justified because even though the CDC lacks the legal authority to issue mandates you're going to have Governors and public health departments and school districts locally and on a state level basically looking at the CDC guidelines and saying okay we're going to follow up because why wouldn't they at this point many of them have been itching to issue a mandate but they haven't gotten that green light from high above today they have that green light right now 21 states all but two of which have Republican Governors currently have laws on the books that prohibit schools from requiring covid vaccinations a few on that list are Arizona Iowa Kansas New Hampshire as well as most of the Southern States California and DC both have school mandates in place that haven't yet taken effect but they will next year so that leaves 25 states that are in neutral territory right now with no policy on the books either way and that's where you're likely to see these battles Brewing particularly as we're only a few weeks away from election day so how persuasive is the argument for adding the coveted vaccine to the schedule well you know I spoke to a lot of different medical experts this week and there was some varied opinion but I will say that a number of them did feel that there's not really solid evidence for this decision here's hamadi on that they claim that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and death in kids and even though children have milder disease than adults the vaccine prevents long covet in children they did this or they made these statements without providing a single ounce of proof um and that's really where the the question here was is does the FDA have any proof of this if they do they haven't put any of it out and it's highly unlikely they do have any such roof because if they did they would have said it now by doing this and relying on the weakest imaginable data to recommend adding these vaccines to Childhood immunization list further puts the CDC uh on Shaky Ground I think it's it's uh frankly shocking that this is how happening the other thing hamadi and the other medical experts I spoke to agreed on they're all very concerned for what this means for trust in the CDC and immunizations overall which they all feel are vital to Public Health all right well we're going to continue to see how this plays out in all the various States Megan thanks for reporting anytime that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham coming up could Republicans run

to a midterm Battleground that's dead even down the stretch who are the latest polls and election news from Nevada as daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips Cabot this is another one of those states that has sort of gone under the radar but could play a huge role in deciding the Senate well you're absolutely right Democrats view Senator Catherine Cortez masto as their most vulnerable incumbent and Republicans are well aware that if they want a majority in D.C Nevada is a great place for them to start right now after trailing over the summer Republican Adam lack salt is ahead in nearly every poll by a slim margin most show them up one to four points though there are some that show Cortez masto with Elite now laxalt's family has a long political history in the southwest his grandfather was the state's former governor and his father Pete dominici was the longest serving Senator in New Mexico's history representing the Republican party for over 30 years so while many candidates come out of the primary trying to build name recognition around the state laxalt has not had much of an issue there and it does seem to have benefited him especially in the early running it does how has lack salt been able to build a lead like he has well like most Republican campaigns he's focused overwhelmingly on the economy and that's working especially well in Nevada the state has the fifth highest price of gasoline in the country they're at 5 18 right now and a recent Congressional report says they're among the seven states hardest hit by inflation and Rising costs but one other issue that's hurting Democrats in Nevada is covet we talked an election wire about this but remember Nevada's economy is incredibly reliant on tourism and the casino industry which are two areas specially decimated during the pandemic that took a long time to recover and that left many nevadans out of work Republicans there lacks all included have had success essentially saying Democrats shut your business down and cost you your job and one thing that's worth noting Cortez masto has actually outspent laxalt's campaign by a four to one margin well her campaign spent nearly 40 million dollars to this point while laxalt has spent just south of 10 million so keep an eye on outside spending as this race continues to remain close ahead of November now there's been a war of words over a potential debate between the two where do things stand now on that front yeah this is an interesting factor in the race so we're only three weeks from election day and unless something drastic happens we're not going to see these two debate that would make them the only Battleground Senate race without a debate and essentially both sides are just refusing to budge blaming the other for refusing to step up so it does not look like we're going to see any debate in this race well that's a big loss for voters let's shift gears a bit and look at the governor's race there where do things stand between Democrats Steve sisalak and Republican Challenger Joe Lombardo well this is another race where Republicans are looking to pick off a Democrat incumbent as sisalak appears very vulnerable right now the Republican Lombardo shocked a lot of people by emerging from a crowded primary field that included people like Dean Heller a former U.S senator and if you look at the polling since winning the nomination he first took the lead back in August and has not trailed in a single pole since he's up on average by one to four points and one final nugget on the races in Nevada this is the first campaign since former Senator Harry Reid passed away and as you know re-dominated Nevada politics for 40 plus years and built a powerful Democrat Grassroots operation that was known as the Reed machine so essentially any Statewide candidate that got his Blessing the Democrat Party would really fall in line with and that was a huge Advantage but now there's a bit of a power struggle within the state's Democrat Party so we'll see if it affects voter turnout on the left come election day yet another fascinating component here to watch in Nevada Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's a daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips [Music] Americans trust in the news media remains at near all-time lows according to new polling from Gallup in their latest result only 34 percent of respondents said they have a great deal or fair amount of trust that news is presented fully accurately and fairly here to discuss why this trust has been eroded over the decades as columnist David Marcus good morning Dave what do the Baseline numbers tell us here good morning so interestingly the number of people expressing trust actually ticked up to 45 percent in 2018 before sinking back down to 34 in 2022 obviously the biggest story in that time period was the covet pandemic and lockdowns and we see that trust among Republicans dropped from 21 to 14 and among Independence is staggering 42 to 27 percent among Democrats that held steady around 70. clearly we know that more conservative leading voters had a lot of problems with how the media handled coven censoring scientists and opinions concealing information and look uh it's showing up in the polls now yeah it makes sense 70 percent of Democrats versus 14 of Republicans trusting the news that's quite Stark now beyond kovid what else is driving this deep partisan division and why are right leaning and citrus Americans so much more likely to doubt what's being reported the vast majority of big Legacy Media Outlets skew left the New York Times The Washington Post NPR Network news etc etc so when respondents think about the general term news media writ large these are the places they're really thinking about so you look at something like Russian collusion and Democrats thought there was a lot of great reporting and damning evidence against Trump Republicans thought it was a hoax there's just two sets of reality at work here right and then the Mueller report really came out on the Republican side there so you could see how that would have impacted confidence now the polls also track for people who have no trust at all in the news media and those who have not very much how have those numbers moved in recent years got a little scary actually the number of people who say they have no trust at all in the news is the highest overall cohort at 38 percent compared to only 28 who said not very much no trust whatsoever is a big thing to say I mean do we know if the Phillies beat the Braves last week or that Joe Biden really likes ice cream is it all fake right and and that's a number that as recently as 1999 was under 10 for it to be 38 now the highest ever it's an astounding degree of distrust this should be setting off alarm Bells all over the industry but I mean it's really not clear that it is now they've run this Poll for almost 50 years now over the first 30 there was a slow decline in trust but starting in 2002 the bottom seems to have sort of dropped out and lack of trust skyrockets do we know what's behind that it's complex but the simplest answer is two words the internet and first on the blogosphere in the early Arts transformed opinion journalism because suddenly anyone with a laptop and internet connection and chops could and did compete with the New York Times and now even on the straight news side having a website without a print edition makes being a news Outlet a a much easier lift is this decline in trust to such low levels something that the industry is actively addressing or are they just ignoring it and going about business as usual it depends on the outlet uh some recent changes at CNN who ditched Brian stelter and basically demoted Don Lemon both of whom were seen as partisans uh suggest the new leadership there is reacting they also just hired Stephen gatowski it was a a right-leaning one might say expert on guns other places notably the times and wapo not so much and there's not a ton of reason to expect these numbers to get much better well obviously the topic of trust in the media is something we're very interested in here on morning wire where we're trying to bring some balance to the conversation thank you for joining us David thanks for having me that was daily wire contributor David Marcus other stories we're tracking this week the

    "bYMQgA85l-I": "first lady casey desantis thank you so much for joining us today i'm honored to be here thanks for letting me be here and please tell ben hello i'm a big fan we will so keep phyllis and what is going on here today in miami so in miami we're doing a couple of things one of which we were out in the everglades earlier today hunting pythons so a lot of people don't know this that the pythons are really invading the everglades and they're eating all the critters there and they've really become an invasive species so we went in with python challenge and we were out there hunting these things with about 800 other folks from 32 states across the nation there's some prize money but it's really trying to continue the governor's initiatives and everything that he's done to protect the environment we put 3.3 billion dollars into florida's environment but particularly protecting the everglades so we've done 1.7 billion in water quality and you know we say that is really important it is the lifeblood of the state but at the same time these pythons are wreaking havoc down there so we're making sure we're doing everything that we can so when you asked where i was today i was out hunting pythons and then from that we went and we did a big event with a bunch of mamas in miami yeah and tell us a little bit more about this event with the mamas in miami because you've been doing a lot of work rallying these mamas to come out to vote can you share a little bit about what that's been like you know why is because mamas are fired up everywhere i go a mama says how can i get involved how can i help support the desantis agenda how can i support what he's done on education and i think it really was covid that allowed a lot of these moms to peer into the classroom for the first time and to see what was being taught without their consent and behind their backs and it's one thing when you come after a mama it's another thing when you come after her kids and so people were coming out of the woodwork to support and so we said how can we corral all of these folks together to try to march on behalf of the governor to have a slam dunk election because i think everybody looks back and they remember what 2018 was like right it was a nail biter it got down to 32 000 votes a half a percentage point between the way florida has gone which is a bastion of freedom and a light to the entire world versus what would have happened had the other person had been elected and it would have been worse than places like california illinois michigan and new york and so we know what's on the ballot freedom is on the ballot and one of the biggest groups of folks that's going to help us get to where we ultimately want to be with a slam dunk election or mamas right and you're a mother of three yourself right yes so as a mother can you share with us what are the issues that are most important to mothers when they're voting there's a lot i mean one of which is public safety right you see a lot of these other states defunding and demonizing law enforcement in florida we have the blues back we've done everything from five thousand dollar bonuses for folks in other states who are tired of the way that they're treated can come to florida and be a part of the solution in law enforcement here in florida you look at education one of the things i'm the most passionate about we should not be indoctrinating these kids we should be educating them and so you look at the anti-crt legislation that was passed by the legislature and signed by the governor the transparency in education which is one of the most important things now you have families have the right to be able to sue a school district if they're not being transparent in what they're teaching their your kids or what's being put in your children's library those are really great foundational legislation pieces that the governor has enacted the civics education is really important that's something that i think we have to be teaching our kids because they after all are going to be the ones that inherit this great nation so if they don't understand where our rights come from if they think that they come from government government gives us the right to speak you've seeded the entire american revolution we need to be teaching these kids that our rights come from god and it's up to government to protect our rights and especially when we saw things like what happened during coven when you had a lot of these governors in other states who were usurping the rights of the people and denying them the ability to be able to see their loved ones at the end of their lives in nursing homes and hospitals based on no science and data and it was really just very scary so i think there's a lot on the minds of mamas and the ballots knowing that we're investing billions of dollars also in improving the environment in florida we understand that florida the waterways are the lifeblood of the state and it's our obligation to leave florida better to our kids and god than we found it also the enforcement of the rule of law you saw the other day the governor went and suspended a state attorney who wasn't upholding his oath to the constitution the u.s and the state by not interpreting or enforcing laws that he was required to do so the governor went in and suspended him so i think if you want bold leadership if you want somebody who believes in individual rights and liberties who understands the the way this our government was created in our foundational principles i think there's just a lot on the ballot that people are going to be turning out in droves for and the other thing i think is really important is honestly this election is about solidifying the policies of everything that the governor has done he just pointed his sixth state supreme court justice just today uh justice renatha francis who by the way is the embodiment of the american dream this woman is phenomenal she's jamaican born worked her way up through law school her mother didn't even graduate from high school but she had a strong foundation and she was able to achieve great things excelled in education and became a state supreme court justice only in america does this happen where you have somebody who who's like that so um we're we're just um i i just think there's a lot of potential and a lot of great things that are going on in the state of florida so let's talk about covet a little more because like you were saying parents are very motivated by what happened during the coronavirus pandemic to get out and vote we're hearing media talking about this growing movement of parents who media describes as kind of skeptic and doubtful and radical based on their experiences during covid what do you make of this doubtful and radical as far as what about vaccinations about lockdowns about health officials and the way they talk about pandemics why why is media they should be skeptical of the uh quote health officials during covet because everything that they told us was basically a lie i mean they said wear the masks it'll stop transmission take the vaccine and you won't get sick and you won't transmit we're looking at a president who still to this day is testing positive for covet after having four jobs they were tying people's jobs to the covid vaccine when they knew that the science and you hear this from berks wasn't uh what they thought what they said it was and so i think yeah people have a right to be very skeptical honestly when you talk about public health officials they've done an immense disservice to the benefit of society because they've been repeatedly wrong on so many things but they haven't had the fortitude to be able to come out and admit that they were wrong and so i think parents are very uh upset by that the other thing were these mask mandates when you look at the masks i mean fauci from the very beginning he knew that these things didn't work it's like putting a chain-link fence in front of a gnat thinking that you're going to stop it but they never acknowledged the ramifications of what those masks were doing to our kids the emotional toll that it was taking because never before have we taken away the ability for kids to be able to see and receive a smile the fact that they're constantly touching their face even fauci admitted that from the beginning oh you know you're touching their face and the schmutz and all of this the kids were coming home and they had swapped masks that's not very sanitary there's actually a group of moms in florida who took those masks and brought them to a lab to have them tested and they found all kinds of bacteria and e coli and all of these things that were in there and so now they're admitting to the developmental delays kids aren't able to speak as well they started some of those critical years in kindergarten first grade with a mask on their face and not the ability to be able to see their teacher and so it really is just disgusting when you look at public officials who will stand up there and take their mask off right and they'll do a press conference randy weingarten was quoted as saying i want people to be able to hear me better so i'm going to take off my mask and at the same time they were forcing and advocating for kids to be muzzled and teachers to be muzzled it wasn't just an atrocity for what a lot of folks did to those kids and i am so proud of the governor to stand strong with no vax mandates and no mask mandates from the very beginning and you also spoke about governor desantis policy decisions lately kind of diving into the culture wars why are we seeing so much sexualization of children so many radical concepts in the classroom in television and media social media tick tock snapchat instagram i i don't know i i think the governor said it best that are we doing so well with reading writing and arithmetic that we think that we need to be injecting gender ideology down the throat of a four-year-old we don't and so that's why they've really passed the legislation where we have parental rights in education which basically says that those kids are not going to be exposed to those things at an early age and that parents have the right to be able to know what's being thrown in front of them in the form of curricular transparency and if they're not getting it they can sue the school districts i'd love to get your take on this new phrase we keep hearing gender affirming care and that's what democrats and activists use to describe transgender sex change surgeries hormones often in the context of kids so one i'd love to hear from you why it's abusive this phrase it's it's not gender affirming care i think that that's another talking point from the left but if you look at the warning from the fda for something like puberty blockers those puberty blockers can cause brain swelling and permanent blindness and that's just what we know about these things but they're giving it to these kids in experimental form and then these kids are going to take these for generation and we'll find out what happens when 80 of this gender dysphoria resolves itself and then you talk about performing these procedures of double mastectomies and castrating these young boys again knowing that this stuff this gender dysphoria resolves itself then they're forced to live with this for the rest of their life i agree with a hundred percent what the governor said about the doctors who are performing those surgeries they should be sued it should be sued and why why is this being pushed right now your guess is as good as mine i think it's just all part of an agenda that the left is pushing but i'll tell you the american people and moms especially don't like it and we don't like it when it's being forced in front of our kids particularly our kindergartners without our consent or knowledge it's wrong and in florida and ain't happening i think there's also something to be said you mentioned about the culture one of the things that the governor and myself have been very invested in is the fatherhood crisis we're seeing across the nation we've invested 61 million dollars in a lot of mentorship programs i have an initiative called hope florida where we're working primarily with struggling single moms to provide their kids mentors to be able to facilitate the opportunity for them to live up to their god-given potential in the american dream by having a father figure i've had through the department of juvenile justice kids who come through that system these are kids that have been just in dire straits they've been abused and they've been neglected but they come through the department of juvenile justice in the form of a youth ambassador's program and they all stop at the mansion once they graduate and these are kids who now are pillars of society they're class presidents they're the first kids in a generation in their family to be able to go to college and i ask them all the same question i say what was it that made you turn your life around from where you are to where you are today and they all give me the exact same answer they say someone at some point took an interest in my life and so unfortunately government can't and shouldn't fix all problems but honestly if there is something that we can do we can incentivize mentorship for a lot of these kids to be able to have that connection with a father figure and tell us a little more about this hope florida pathway to freedom is it a pathway to pathway to so it's hope florida pathway to prosperity economic self-sufficiency and hope so it dates back to really 2019 when the governor was first elected and i traveled around this the state because i wanted to learn more about the child welfare sphere in particular in the state of florida we have 16.5 million people of faith 20 000 institutions of faith and they are doing wonderful things but we wanted to bring them to the table in a meaningful way so we created and worked with a group who has something called care portal a care portal is basically the faith-based community on speed dial so let's say sally who's coming into the system through the department of children families she is a struggling single mom she doesn't have bunk beds she doesn't have mattresses her kids are having a hard time eating she can't put food on the table what a hope navigator will do will take those needs input them into the system and then a real-time alert will go to those participating faith and community-based organizations and what happens then is those institutions can deliver those needs directly to sally's doorstep so they'll show up with bunk beds mattresses and a warm cooked meal so not only are you looking beyond government to help support you're also doing a great thing on behalf of sally and what's interesting is that we find that those requests into the care portal are only by and large inputted and executed once and you would think well certainly sally has other needs there are the things that she might gas cards you know with biden and inflation and gas prices now there's clearly more things that she needs but what we found is is there's a connection that has been made between sally and the participating faith organizations and they cannot unsee what they saw and those faith-based communities are not going to let sally or her kids go hungry again so again government can exit stage right which is wonderful you're connecting the dots and getting out of the way it not only benefits sally it really helps the faith-based community because that fulfills their mission and it helps society as a whole and it benefits the state of florida well thank you very much for joining us we so appreciate your time yeah thank you thanks for having me",

    "_i1weexKTZg": "[Music] the world's most influential search engine has been accused of suppressing information put out by GOP candidates ahead of the election and the 12 cases the Republicans have been pushed to page two we evaluate the claims and the evidence I'm daily wire editor-in-chief John Bickley with Georgia Howe happy Halloween it's Monday October 31st and this is morning wire Georgia has turned into a purple state in recent elections but Republicans are hoping to shift it back to Red I want to try to unite people bring people together we hear from a candidate in the senate race that's shaping up to be one of the tightest and most important in the country and a new report reveals that the vast majority of the billions of dollars distributed to schools during the pandemic went unused where is that money now and why wasn't it used as intended thanks for waking up with morning wire stay tuned we have the news you need to know the American economy is still with effects of a two-year pandemic and lockdown induced recession which is why you should take action to hedge against inflation right now and solidify at least some of your Investment Portfolio with gold from Birch gold text wire to 989898 and Birch gold will send you a free information kit on how to diversify and protect your savings with precious metals that's w-i-r-e to 989898 to claim your free no obligation information kit on how to protect your hard-earned savings with gold foreign the world's leading search engine Google has been accused of intentionally suppressing search results about GOP candidates while promoting search results for left-wing candidates additionally on Friday the GOP filed a lawsuit against the tech giant for allegedly directing Republican candidates emails to Spam folders at much higher rates than Democratic candidates it's more about the claims is daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham so Megan Republicans are leveling these accusations what kind of evidence do they have well there's two parts to this there's the search results and then there's the emails so to start with the search results the conservative Watchdog group media research Council tested Search terms for Republican candidates on three different engines Google bang and DuckDuckGo and it specifically searched keywords related to the top 12 races that the website RealClearPolitics has highlighted as key to controlling the Senate the mrc's analysis found that Google buried 10 of the 12 campaign websites for Republican candidates on the second page or even lower in the search results meanwhile the sites of their Democratic opponents appeared on the first page and as organic results as opposed to paid results so the MRC says the results for the other search engines bang and DuckDuckGo were much more even-handed on Fox news on Tuesday MRC president Brent bozell argued that Google is acting out of political bias if you are somebody searching that Republican that person doesn't exist for all intents and purposes the Republican candidate is a non-person and that's Google who deliberately put them on page two so the MRC issued a report on its finding saying that Google favors Democrat candidates over Republicans about 83 percent of the time and they say that random algorithm settings really can't account for the Stark differences that they're seeing and the different results of these various search engines and that's significant because Google is the biggest search platform in the world it has more than 90 percent of web searches performed using its service so in a very meaningful way the company has something of a monopoly on search results and for that reason the MRC is now calling on Congress to investigate Google search bias and the impact they say it might be having on midterm elections now has Google responded to the MRC report yes they have they put out a statement saying that they can't comment on specific claims without announcing the research but they said that there's no validity whatsoever to these allegations of bias and they also said that third parties have found that political ideology is not a factor in their search ranking systems they also added that they don't and would never manipulate search results modify their products or enforce their policies in any way promote or disadvantage any particular political ideology Viewpoint or candidate so that's their comment okay so let's move on to the development on Friday which seems even more serious because there's already been a lawsuit filed what were the grounds for that suit well as John mentioned the RNC filed this Federal lawsuit on Friday in California and they're claiming that Google has violated several state laws regarding political discrimination and unlawful business practices so the RNC says they've tracked Gmail inbox delivery for nearly a year now and they discovered that at specific times each month that are known to be very important to fundraising Google has been diverting committee emails to Spam folders now the RNC said these emails would drop from around 90 percent successful inboxing rate and that's the term for how often an email reaches a user's inbox to nearly zero during those significant periods the committee says it tried to work with Google to resolve the problem but that Google just gave them excuses and then eventually stopped answering now were they able to establish that this wasn't also happening with Democratic campaign emails they say that they were yes the filing pointed to a recent study out of North Carolina state that found Gmail labels campaign emails from Republican candidates a Spam 68 of the time but it only does it eight percent of the time for their Democratic counterparts they also tested whether it was happening with other email servers like Yahoo and Outlook and they say they did not observe the same pattern happening so MRC is basically accusing Google of election meddling that's huge yep all right well Megan thanks for reporting anytime that was daily wire culture reporter Megan Basham coming up with the Georgia Senate race among the country's

Walker the Republican locked in one of the nation's tightest and most important Senate races joining us now with the latest from the Battleground state of Georgia is daily wire senior editor Cabot Phillips all right Kappa before we talk about our team's conversation with Walker if you would give us an update on the polls in Georgia well after not leading in a single poll from mid-september to mid-october Herschel Walker is now ahead in all three major polls coming out of Georgia over the last week we talked about our exclusive Trafalgar poll last week that had him up two then there was another from Fox that had him up three and then a third from Rasmussen where he led by five and worth noting all of those polls showed independent voters breaking hard for Walker the Rasmussen Poll for example had him up 14 points on that front now we've been waiting to see how independent voters would break remember they usually do not solidify their decision until the weeks before election day and Republicans are thrilled by those numbers yeah I'm sure they are so for those who don't always trust polling keep in mind even if the polls are often off from the final numbers one thing we know they do well is tracking momentum and voter Trends and in this case we've seen every poll reflect a shift towards Walker and that's just impossible to deny yeah it definitely seems that way now our team spoke with Walker about the race what do you have to say well we did reach out to both campaigns but warnock's team declined the interview we asked Walker what he views as the biggest contrast between his campaign and warnocks and it was interesting he went straight to the issue of crime I think crime is a huge problem in Georgia where is Senator we're not seeing that have called on men and women in blue Thugs and bullets and he don't believe that uh law enforcement he believes in no cash bail uh he believes that uh opening up the prisons letting prisoners out and and I I don't and I believe in securing that border he knows to seeing the motor security border Walker also made sure to bring up his opponent's record of voting with President Biden's agenda that's something we've seen from Republican candidates on debate stages across the country and clearly a topic debut as a winning message nine to six percent of the time he voted with Joe Biden that's the problem right there they seem to be headed in the wrong direction but they don't seem to want to turn around or change and things not going to get better they can't admit that we got a problem now we also spoke to Walker about some of the elements of his personal life that have really become a Hot Topic in this race yeah that has been one of the main things Democrats have tried to use against him Walker has been accused of fathering multiple children out of wedlock over the last few decades and there was also that huge story that he had allegedly paid for a woman's abortion now while he denies that specific claim he does admit that he's made mistakes in the past and calls himself an open book now I've had my faults but those folks of things I've done and and I've been redeemed from those folks years ago anyone that had never fallen down and gotten up can never say that they're they're too mad but I said this is not about Senator one not personal life it's not about my personal life what is about whether you can represent Georgia as a senator and I hope people saw during the debate that I'm the one that could represent Georgia as a senator because I will always always fight for the Georgia people before we go there was a hot mic moment over the weekend that really had a lot of people talking what happened there on Thursday Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was talking with President Biden on a Tarmac outside Air Force One apparently he did not realize he was near a microphone and started candidly discussing the state of the Georgia Senate race saying that Democrats were going downhill it's a bit tough to make out but have a listen [Music] the direct quote there is quote the state where we're going downhill is Georgia it's hard to believe that they will go for Herschel Walker so not the most optimistic message from a man who's obviously tracking this race very closely definitely not Kevin thanks for reporting anytime that's daily wire senior editor Kappa Phillips a new report by The Washington Post is shedding light on coveted funding for schools and revealing important information about how its use and lack thereof impacted students across the country the federal funds were the biggest surge of emergency dollars in U.S history but now questions are being raised about how they're being used here to discuss is daily wire's Charlotte Pence Bond Charlotte walk us through these numbers here what did this report find for some background last March the Biden administration's American Rescue plan led to Public Schools getting 122 billion dollars that was supposed to go towards helping them recover from the pandemic and it went out fast 81 billion dollars was distributed less than two weeks after it became law but schools haven't used a lot of the money a Washington Post analysis of data from edunomics showed the school system said they spent less than 15 percent of the coveted money during last school year so less than 15 that certainly raises a lot of questions is this happening everywhere School spent differed between states and evil areas but an alarming Trend emerged the places where kids learning has suffered the most only spent five percent or less of the funds last year Ed genomics estimated that public school students are 12 weeks behind in reading and 20 weeks behind in math and that could take over 116 million dollars to repair and do we know why the money wasn't used well it could be for many reasons education officials and experts said the time it took to get the money and the teacher shortage or factors as well as districts wanting to make sure the funds last as long as possible keeping track of the money in-house used can also be difficult the reported percentage of what schools are spending is also just reflective of how much the district asked the state for schools have a lot of leeway with how they use the funds at least 20 percent has to go towards learning loss but some have said they're buying new learning materials furniture and school resources and at least 31 of the 100 largest districts are giving teachers bonuses that comes from future Ed Georgetown education research organization there's also concern that the districts won't be able to keep up new practices if they're improving education in ways that aren't sustainable for example lots of schools gave out laptops to every kid in 2020 but when the laptops stop working they're going to have to find a way to replace them right now we reported recently that kids are really behind in schooling after the pandemic great kids fall behind because of many reasons especially if they didn't have someone help them learn but Wi-Fi was a huge Factor too if kids didn't have good internet while they were stuck in their houses they couldn't take classes online Baltimore's budget includes buying hot spots for families and some regions are putting the money towards tutoring so some lessons seem to have been learned from kovid but
